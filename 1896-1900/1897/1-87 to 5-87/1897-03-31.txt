which caused the warships to bombard

a mixed detachment of international
troops.
LONDON. Eye, March 30.â A dispatch
to the. Central News from Athens states
that a strong force of insurgents to-day
attacked the Turkish troops at Spina-
Jonaa, Crete. The troops matie a desper
ate defense of their positions, but could
not withstand the determined onslaught
ol the Christians, aÂ»d wÂ«ro finally com
pelled to retreat. There was iwavy Saut
ing throughout the engagement. The
dispatch adds that a vessel lying in the
harbor of Spinalonga laden with ammuni

insurgents who removed the captured
supplies to places out of reach of the
Turks.
INSURGENTS ARE ENRAGED.

tttounh a Finn nf Truce I* Displayed.
CANEA, Crete, March 30.â The attack j
of the Turks on the insurgent leaders who
went to Coube, near Retimo, Sunday to
meet the Russian Consul, who had been \
delegated to confer with them, has caused j
much indignation. The Consul had in- I
viteJ them to Coube, but did not meet. I
them Sunday because of the failure of the I
Turkish officials to inform him of their
arrival as they had promised to do. Yes
terday the Consul, accompanied by twenty <
Russian soldiers, went to Coube, hoping
to see the rebel chiefs. The insurgents
I mistrusted his motives after their enperi
ence on Sunday, and from the hills they
fired upon the Russians, despite the fact
that they were carrying a flag of truce.
.Eventually the Consul by signaling per
suaded a score of the insurgents to come
. to parley, but among those who descendpd
from their positions was none of the lead
ers. The conference, therefore, was vir
tually fruitless. The Consul found those
w'tn whom be conferred utterly ignorant
of the meaning of autonomy, of wnichi he
was desirous of securing their acceptance.
He explained the scheme of the powers
to give the Cretans self-government. The
insurgents said they would consider the
matter.
In the fighting at Spinalonga'on March
, 23 and 24 the Turkish garrison lost heavily
"" and were compelled to take refuge on an
I island. Tne insurgents swam to the
/ i "sland and continued their attack. A
' â¢ French ironclad has gone to Spinalonga,
presumably to relieve the Turks, whose
position is extremely precarious.

MINERS BLOWN TO PIECES.
Two Unfor'unate Msn Meet a Fearful
Death by Getting Careless With
Explosives.
WEBB CITY, Mo., March 30.â Ben
Brewer and Lon Gunnine lost their lives,
both being literally blown to pieces at
Orongo. They were miners and while
thawing out a box of powder it exploded.
Each left a widow and several children.
The accident was a great surprise to the
friends and acquaintances of the two
men, ns they knew them to be old and
experienced miners. It is thought, how
ever, that long familiarity with powder
boxei made them reckless, and that they
did not take the care they should have
done.
The men were very popular in the com
mnnily, and their awful death w.-.s a sad
blow to their friends. Their respective
families are practically destttuie and
charitable neighbors are doing what they
can to help them out.
It is one of the most awful catastrophes
that ever occurred in this neighborhood,
and the community is greatly shocked.
Some of the fellow-miners of the deceased
say that thn box of powder was not
properiy fixed by the company which
sold i i to the miners, and they say that
an investigation ahould be held. All the
evidence possible will be brought out at
the Coroner's inquest, which will take
place to-morrow.

"TIME WILL
SHOW, HISTORY
WILL JUDGE"
That Is What General Rivera
Says When Asked If
He Is Right
THE CAPTIVE VERY RETICENT.
Correspondents Visit the Cuban Leader, Who
Was Taken Prisoner While Fighting
for Freedomâ Sanguilly May Take
Rivera's Place.
HAVANA, Cuba, March 30.â Several re- 1
porters went to San Cristobal to-day for
the purpose ot Interviewing General .Ruiz
Rivera, the commander of the insurants
in the province of Pinar del R;o, who was
captur- d by the forces of General Velasco
dur.ng an engagement near Cabezedas on
Sunday.
General Rivera, as stated in the dis
patches of yesterday, was badly wounded
in the fight and was taken prisoner as his
chief of staff, Colonel Bacallao, was at
tempting to carry him from the field.
Colonel Bacallao was also captured.
The reporters found General Rivera,
who was contined in the quarters of the
Guardia Civile, resting more easily than
yesterday, his wounds having been at
tended to by Spanisn physicians.
He was very re;icent regarding the con
dition of affairs among the insurgent! in
the provinces, positively refusing to an
swer any questions. He spoke freely on
other topics and dwelt at length upon the
history of the ten years' war, in which he
played a prominent part.
One of the intervieweis asked him if he
did not think it useless to cause so much
bloodshed in fighting aeainst the sov
ereignty of Span. His face at once be
came very serious and he replied: "Time
will show; history will judge."
Both General Rivera and Colonel Ba
callao said that they were thankful for the
good treatment they had received since
they were captured General Rivera has
presented a diamond ring he wore to the
surgeon who has attended him since he
was made a prisoner.
SANGUILLY TO COMMAND.
It la Said That Be. Hill Succeed the Cap
tured, General Hirrra.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 30.â 1t
is stated that General Julio Sanguilly,
hero of the ten-years' war in Cuba,
a military tactician of acknowledged
ability, the peer of Gomez as a
general and of Maceo as a fiahtea
is to succeen General Ruiz Rivera
as the commander of the Army of the
West, and his advent will cause a change
in the policy and conduct of the campaign
in Pinar del Rio, in which province the
very degressive movements oi the Spanish
forces are now being made.
Rivera is now in the bands of the Span
iards, if recent Havana dispatches are to
be depended upon. It is not likely if hÂ«*
is really a prisoner that he will be re
carded as a prisoner of war, but will be
tried by a drum-head court-martial as a
bandit and rebel and be shot to death.
In this event his successor will be in the
saddle on the day that the sentence is
carried into effect, unless the execution is
so summary ttiat he will be unable to
reach the field in time.
General Sanguilly is the Cuban patriot
who served two years iv jail charged with
the crime of rebellion. He is a natural
ized American citizen and was released
through the good offices of this Govern
ment in February.

They bavo also sent a cablegram to the
Government at Madrid praising General
Weyler's campaign against the rebels and
expressing confidence that he will speedily

Forty-three political suspects were exiled

TRICE FIVE CENTS.
Cuba is bound to win in the struggle.
Spain is spending on an average of $10,
--000,000 a month and losing 3000 men every
thirty days through sickness, battle and
starvation. The Cnbans are growing
stronger every day. They now number
33,000 rigntprs and 100,000 sympathizers,
as against 265,000 available fighting men

American attorney is elected to go to Cuba
he might go, and that he had the matter
under consideration.
KENTUCKY'S SENATORIAL FIGHT.
Hunter Lacks Thrje Votes of Being
Electedâ Rumors of Bribery
Freely Circulate.
FRANKFORT, Ky., March 30.â Eight
ballots for United States Senator were
taken toy thÂ« excited Legislature to-day
without chancre or an election, and the
supporters of Dr. Hunter f 2 still solid, so
far as the vote 3 indicate. The anti-Hunter
men, however, are claiming to-night that
this was Hunter's last day in the lead and
that to- morrow the inevitable break in bis
columns will come, carrying with it the
election of Governor Bradley or St. John
Boyle. The sixth ballot, of which the
subsequent seven were practically dupli
cates, was as follows: Hunter 60, Black
burn 43, Teavie 13, Boyle 7, Stone L
Hunter lacked three votes ot being
ejected. This was the first day that more
than one ballot bad been taKen, and it was
regarded as a final play of the Hunter
forces to force his election. Attempts
were made to adjourn at the end of the
twelfth ballot, delaying the next ballot
one hour. The chamber presented any
thing but a dignified appoarance, nearly
every member making, a commotion on
the adjournment question. The Bradley
coalition, whic > held a caucus last nigbt,
reported forty-eight silver Democrats
ready to vote for Bradley and nine gold
Democrats. The Republicans present
said they had enough votos present to
make an election. Rumors of bribery and
corruption are iv everybody's mouth.

DINGLEY'S BILL
CAN'T BE BEATEN
Slow but Sure Progress
Made With the Tariff
Schedules.
Sayers, a Democrat From Ttxi?,
Demands a Duty on
Hides.
Cries of "Rats" Drown au Attmpt
to Style Secretary Ga;e a
Free-Traier.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 30.â When
proceedings were begun on the tariff bill
in the House to-day Dockery (D.) of
Missouri asked unanimous consent that
the free list might bi considered in order
that he might offer his amendment put
ting those articles on the free list con
trolled by trusts in the United States, but
Payne (R.) of New York objected.
Tiie Committee on Ways ana Means
took command of the situation again and
presented a number ot amendments agreed
upon at their meeting last night, mostly
intended to perfect the phraseology and
to correct slight omissions and errors.
Among them were: Making covered safety
luse dutiable at 45 per cent, ad valorem;
making the duty on crude tartar or wine
lees to be \i cent a pound on the article
testing less man 50 per cent; nitrate of pot
ash, 1 cent a pound on the article testing
above that strength; reducing from 20 to
13 per cent ad valorem the duty on certain
grades of hat and bonnet braids; restor
ing the language of the McKinley law re
lating to Moquette and similar carpets
and Oriental rugs.
Sajers (V. ) of Texas, referring to
Payne's statement last Saturday, that the
hides imported into the United States
were principally from tue hot countries,
such as did not come into competition
â with those produced in the United States,
quoted from the treasury Hats to show as
claimed a great variance between the
gentleman's statement and the facts in
the case.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois said, in a SDeech
advocating a tax on hides, for p. quarter of
a century free hides had prevailed and in
that period the leather industries of tlu
country had prospered and grown, until
they had practically conquered the mar
kets of the world. Now, he was satiÂ«ned,
a duty could be imposed without interfer
ing seriously at ieast with the leather
industry. He desired the attention of the
Massachuseta members while he said that
the proposed duly would add at least $1
to the value of every head of cattle in the
country. He was willing to take the bill
as it came from the Committee on Ways
and Means. And if that committee couid
gee it? way clear to recommend the duty
he would gladiy follow its lead, just as
he would fo.iow it in voting lor a reduc
tion of duties on products of woolen man
ufactures if the Massachusetts gentlemen
thought they were too high. [Applause.]
Slayden (D.) of Texas said the peop c of
his district and of all the range country
were interested in tins matter and de
lnandeo a duty on hides.
Bell (Pop.) of Colorado made a brief
sj eccn in lavor of a duty on hides, sayine
it would confer more benefit on the farmer
than all the duties on the agricultural
schedule combined.
Dingley (It.) of Maine said that when
the Commute on Ways and Means, of
which the present President was. the
chairman, wes preparing a revenue bill in
1810 it made an exhaustive investigation
to determine whether or not a duty on
hides woUid benefit ihe farmers of the
United Stales They iound the following
state of lacts:
1. That the great body of hides used in this
country were produced as a by-product and
the price was tuade here.
2. As to goatskins and a large number of
other skins for tanning, -we found that we did
not have them ami that they must be im
porte'i.
3. That the importations of thick hides, ex
cept In a few special cases, were dry hides for
hole leather and largely used for export be
cause ol our cheap tanning materials, thus
euab.'intc us to reach ioreign markets with, tlie
product. â 'â â â¢-
From tbesa facts we concluded that un
der the special conditions obtaining, and
further, that but twice in the history of
the country â and 1852â had ttiere
been a duty imposed on hide-*;." no advan
tage would accrue to the farmer from - re
imposing a duty, and that a disadvantage
would be ielt by those engaged in the ex
port' leather trade. It was believed that a
duty on hides would shut off this export
trade and prevent the tanning of hides
here and drive it into Canada. In view of
these facts the final conclusion of the
committee was against imposing a duty.
Dingley said no one appeared before
the committee in 1896 to ask a duty. Cut
the committee made an independent in
vestigation and found no reason to change
tho opinion reached by the committee in
1890.
' Livingstone criticized the committee
for failing to include in the bill a schedule
to raise revenue and to protect American
industries, ,< duty on hides. AlO per cent
ad valorem duty on hides imported last
year would have produced $1,400,030 and a
tax of 1 cent a pound on eoatsKins would
have produced $560,000.
.Hepburn (R. ) of lowa also advocated
placing a duty on hides, speaking in his
usual emphatic manner, to the delight of
the Democrats and a portion of. the Repub
licans.
"lowa is more interested in this product
than she is in wool,'' he said. "We pro
duce more than $3,000,003 worth of hides
and $1,000,000 worth of wool. It may be
that there are reasons valuable, economic
and controlling why there should be no
duty on hides, but I want to hear a better
one than has yet been given in the course
of this debate. I believe in the protection
system and in the general purposes of this
bill, but I believe that in framing its pro
visions the committee has not given the
consideration it should to the interests
that they should have. I hope that the
committee in the multiplicity of amend
ments, which it is offering will find the
opportunity to present one to put a duty
on hides and test the sense of the House
on the question." .; [Applause.]
' After discussing a number o: additional
amendments offeced by the Committee
on Ways and Means the committee of the
whole was entertained by Perkins (K.) of
lowa, and later by Clark (D.) of Missouri.
ClarK said that he had enjoyed no scene
so much since Senator Teller and his con
ferees went out of the St. Louis conven
tion last June as that in the House yes
terday when the Massachusetts Sen
ator ran amuck through the bill
and Gronvenor (R.) of Ohio and
Russell (R.) of Connecticut ran amuck
through them, while the gray eagle of
Worcester (Walker, R., of Massachusetts)
swooped , down on the whole outfit.
[Laughter.]
He wanted to ask the members of the
Committee. on Ways and Means a ques
tion or two; first,' he wanted" to know if
this bill had teen referred for his approval
to Lyman J. Gage, the free trade Secre
tary of the Treasury. "He was a free
trader in 1884 ana 1888 and there is do evi
dence that he is not now. He was se- !
lected foi 1 this high position over grizzled
veterans of your party, because, being a
Chicago millionaire, he was able to make
a larue contribution to the campaign
iund." [Groans and cries of "Ruts."]
If the pending bill was not a sectional
measure, Clartc asked why it was that the
farmer of the West paid no duty on hides,
while the boot and shoe niiÂ»nutacturers of
Massachusetts had a high duty on his
product. Why was it that tne Southern j
planter had free cotton and the New Eng- j
land manufacturer a high duty on his |
manufactured cotton. The answer was
given with a brutal frankness by the gen
tleman from Indiana (Mr. Franklin), who
said that the people of the West and
South niuat first vote the Republican
ticket, or what is the same thing, for a
high tariff, before they would be permit
ted to participate in the benefits of the
protective system.
In conclusion Clark said that the people
of tl'.e South and West might be fools,
ns the gentleman from Massachusetts
(Walker) denominated them, but they
knew enough to know when they were
being sandbagged, and to say to the high
wayman of New England that they had
some rights that he ought to respect.
[Applause.]
A little later Mahoney (R.) of New
YorK took occasion to say that he was
tired of the continued unloading of Grover
Cleveland upon their party and that for
one member of that party he repudiated
him.
Carmack(D.) of Tennessee inquired a
moment later if there was anything in
the bill wiiicii proposed an increase of
duty on Grover Cleveland ? If there was
it niu^t have been passed when tallow was
tinker consideration. [Democratic ap
plause.]
Bland proposed an amendment author
izing the iree admission of articles pur-
Chased abroad with the proceeds of agri
cultural products raised in the United
States and exported. Supporting the
amendment, IJ: and said tne bill was
framed in the interests of the East. He
appealed from a decision of the chair
(Sherman (It.) oi New York) that the
amendment was not in order, and the ob
jection was sustained.
Referring to the suggestion by Bland that
the bill was framed in the intereets of the
East Henderson (R. ) of lowa called atten
tion to the fact that tne West controlled the
Republican majority of the committee,
seven to four. He said that no man. dead
or alive, ever saw a tariff bill pass through
the House which met his approval in every
respect. Under a protective tariff the
West enjoyad the best prosperity and
greatest happiness it ever enjoyed in the
history of the Republic. [Applause.]
At intervals during the progress of the
debate the following amendments pro
posed by the Committee on Ways and
Means were agreed io : Providing that no
gloves above number six should be I
classed as children's gloves; making metal j
strings for musical instruments dutiable at !
45 per cent ad valorem; reducing the
tariff on cocoa matting from 12 to 6 cents
a yard and on cocoa mats from 8 to 4 j
cents n square foot; making slate-pencils j
dutiable at 4 cents a hundred instead of a
gross; makiue silk baiting clotti, lor mill
ing purposes only, durable at 25 per cent
ad valorem; permitting the free entry of
?100 worth of household utensils belong
ing to immigrants to the United States;
of glass disks ior tc entitle instruments, of
dried fish sounds, of dyes produced from
coal tar and not made in this country, of j
crude salts evaporated from mineral j
waters, of carbonate oi potash, of sheep!
dip. of shrimps and other shellfish.
Smith (D.) ol Anzona und Cowherd (D.) ;
of Missouri opposed the proposed increase
in ' tie duty on cattle.
D.ugiey offered an amendment provid
ing for the free entry of sci-ntitic appa
ratus, instruments, chemicals, books,
mans, etc., such as are not made or pub
lished in the United State*, when ex
pressly imported in good faith by and for
tne use oi any regulated established or in
corporated institution of learning or sci
entific society or public library and not
intended for sale.
Pending this an animated debate oc
curred on the lumber -ch^dule between
Arnold (R ) and Brucker (D.)of Michi
gan, the latter denouncing tne dmy as
"absurd and wicke'."
The free-book amendment was agreed
toâ lll to 81.
Tawney (R.) of Minnesota moved to
change the duty on horses and mules to
$30 on animals valued at less than $150 a
bead; 2b per cent ad valorem on animals
valued at over thnt sum.
On this Hill (R ) of Connecticut made a
vigorous speech on tne lumber duty. He
asserted and defied < ontradictiou tnat ail
the tariff chances had ever added a dollar
to or taken from the price of lumber paid
by the consumer. A motion by lawney
was agreed to putting a duty on leather
shoelaces less tiian a yard long of 25 cents
a dozen pairs and 25 per cent ad valorem,
and on laces over a yard long 60 cents a
dozen pairs an<i 25 per cent ad valorem.
An amendment offered by Grosvenor
(R. ) of Ohio was agreed to reducing the
duty on bronze or Dutch metal or alumi
num, in Teaf, from 8 to 4 cents a package
of 100 leaves; also an amendment increas
ing the duty on high-class lithographic
labels of ten xsr more colors, printed in
white or in part in metal leaf from 30 to
4'J cents, a pound.
In lieu of the paragraph in the bill re
lating to mica. Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio
offered the following: Mica. 2 cents per
pound on dimensions 2 inches square or
less, and 2 cents per pound additonal for
each ad iitional square inch, provided that
the maximum duty shall in no case ex
ceed 50 cents per pound.
This, he explained, on the higher grades
of mica was lees than the pres-nt ad
valorem duty of '25 per cent. The amend
ment was agreed to.
A motion by Evr.ns (R. ) of Kentucky
was agreed to, amending the paragraph
prohibiting the importation of convict
labor made goods so as to require Â»he
Secretary of the Treasury to make regula
tions necessary to carry the provisions
into effect.
On motion of Dingloy powdered choco
late, unsweetened, was put in the list at 5
cents a pound, a consideiable reduction,
he said. This completed the list of com
mittee amendments and the readingof tbe
bill at the point reached last Saturday was
resumed.
Proceedings of the committee were in
terrupted to permit Speaker Reed to an
nounce his signature to the joint resolu
tion appropriating $250,000 for the relief of
tlie Mississippi Valley flood sufferers and
making appropriation to meet deficien
cies.
Lentz (D.) of Indiada made a
sj.pfM-h on the coal duty. He said that
under tbe operation of the present duty of
40 cents a ton the mines of Ohio and
other Western States bad exported nearly
a million and a half tons of coal into
Cannda, while Nova Scotia had tent to
the Eastern market of the United States
less than 300,000 tons. He asked why
General Grosvenor, representing a great
State joining nis own, bad not protested
against this surrender by tbe four East
ern members of the Committee on Ways
and Means to the anthracite pool with its
millions of turplus and denounced the
infernal outrage of tho increase of duty
from 40 to 75 cents a ton, which would
destroy the coal-mining interest* of Ohio,
Indiana and Illinois. Lentz presented
If tters from the coal men of Ohio, oper
ators, miners and railroad employes, pro
testing against the change.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio replied, inform
ing the House what had been done by the
Committee on Ways and Means and why
no one, he said, had app ared before the
bill was reported to the House to object to
the proposed increase of duty, but after
ward the demand wa9 made, the argument
being advanced that if the duty were re
tained at 40 cents ihe Canadian Govern
ment would reduce its tariff from 60 to 40
cents to correspond. But against this the
complaints of Maryland, Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky protested, claim
ing that tn-y had a right to be protected
as well as others iuterested.
Hopkins (R.)of Il'inois expressed his
personal opinion, founded upon observa
tion and tie experience of others, that the
reciprocity between this country and Can
ada on coal would be a good thing, which
ended the discussion.
The -com mil toe then rose and fifteen
minutes were spent in an unavailing effort
to reach an agreement on the time for de

T0 TAKE THE PLACE OF STEAM.
Mr, Tripler Claims io Hcve Made a
Wonderful Discovery Wiih
L quefitd Air.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 30.â 1t was
developed yesterday that the explosion at
the Hotel Endicoit on Saturday evenini;
was the result of experiments which C. E.
Tripler has been carryine on for eight or
nine years in search of a new power. He
professes to have discovered it, and says
he is going to revolutionize transporta
tion and manufacturing.
The mysterious whitish compound
which was supposed to be a new and
powerful freezing mixture is liquefied air
and is the basis of Tripler's power, which
he contends will take the place of steam
and produce energy at a minimum of cost.
He is noi ready to let the pub ie into his
secret. How he liquefies air he will not
tell. It has bien done before, but in small
quantities, in scientific laboratories, but
never commercially. When liquefied the
air is at a temperature of 450 rtegreeÃ be
low zero on the Fahrenheit scale. It boils
or vaporizes a^aiu at 310 degrees below
zero, and it is from the expansion conse
quent upon this vaporization that .Mr.
Tripler obtains his j.ower, which is trans
mitted through an engine exactly as tbe
power generated by steam from boiling
water is transmitted.
The most remarkable claim is yet to be
told. Mr. Tripler declares t hat his lique
fied air in boiling, or changing to vapor
again, absorbs the heet in tbe surrounding
air so quickly that it is in turn liquefied
and flows into the reservoir, which in
this manner is always kept supplied.
Tnat is, once the apparatus i-* charged
with a supply of liquefied air it feeds
itself and will practically run forever
without any cost lor fuel. Mr. Tripler
declarrs, too, that there is no loss of power
in this process.
Proiessor Gordon of Columbia College,
an authority on physics, when asked for
an opinion on the mater yesterday, was
inclined to be skeptical. "Of course. It is
possible to liquefy air," said he. "That
has been done repeatedly, and there is no
reason why an engine should not be run
with it, but it ha-Â« never been done com
mercial^', and energy must be used to
liquefy it in the first place. It seems ab
surd to say that the apparatus will feed
itself without los 1 * of power. It. has been
demonstrated that liquefied air in vapor
izing will condense a very small propor
tion of its own bulk from the surrounuing
air, lut the proportion is so small that it
may bÂ« disregarded. Of course, if Mr.
Tri pier's claims are true he lias made a
wonderful discovery."

DEEP PROBLEMS
FOR THE SENATE
Populist Allen of Nebraska
Talks Nonsense About
the Tariff.
Sheepmen of Montana, per Mr.
Mantle, Threaten tbe New
Bill.
Organization cf Committees Considered
al a Caucus of Repub icm
M mb rs.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 30.-Tbe
open session of tbe Senate to-day lasted
until 2 p. m., when the Senate resumed be
hind closed doors the consideration of the
arbitration treaty, spending two and n half
hours in the discussion. To the 1404 bills
that had been introduced up to the close
of Monday's sesMon, there were enough
added toÂ«day to brins the whole nurabet
above the figure of 1500â the vast majority
of them being pension bills.
The Populist Senator from Nebraska,
Allen, occupied more than an hour in an
elaborate argument to prove that Congress
is "not possessed of the constitutional
power to impose tariff duties on articles
ol" daily consumption for the express and
avowed purpose of increasing the pri
vate fortunes of one class of citizens at
the expense of the masses." He char
acterized as preposterous the claim that
a i.igti tariff raised the price of (arm
products and was of vast benefit to the
farmers.
The resolution embodying the doctrine
which be had offered yesterday was, at
the close of his speech, referred to the
Committee on Finance.
Another menace'to tbe bill now pending
was< contained in a resolution of the Board
of Sheep Commissioners of Montana (pre
sented by Senator McÃride of that State)
to tbe effect that unless the wool-growers
of the United States received the most
ample protection tbe policy of protection
could be no longer maintained.
A resolution asking information as to
the letters of Maximo Gonuz, the com
manding general of the insurrectionary
forces, to President McKinley and ClÂ«ve
lan 1 was offered by Morgan (D.) of Ala
bama, and was laid over to be called up to
morrow.
The House amendments to tbe joint res
olution passed yesterday by the Senate ap
propriating |250,000 to aid in protecting
life and property in tbe Mississippi floods
were concurred in by tbe Senate and the
joint resolution was sent to the President.
At 4:30 p. m. the Senate adjourned.
CAUCUS OF REPUBLICANS.
.Vo Headway Mad* in the Committee Con-
Irorerty.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 30.â The
Republicans of the Senate this morning
put more enthusiasm into the organiza
tion of the Senate so far as the committee
vacancies are concerned. The caucus was" '
called for 10 o'clock and was promptly' at-'
tended by almost every one of the straight
Republicans of the party. Adjournment
was not taken until 11:30 o'clock.
Senator William L. Allison, chairman
of the caucus committee, made an elab
orate report, ia wbich be told of the
troubles that had been confronted and
which seem to l>e in the way of the com
mittee. Many conferences had b?en
headed by Democratic steering commit
tee?, and at no time were the members of
that committee, and particularly Gorman,
its chairman, willing to admit that there
was any change in the condition of the
Republican party since the Senate com
mittees had been reorganized by the Re
publicans. The Democrats insisted, said
Allison, that they should have the same
number of men on the committees as th- y
bad under previous arrangements, and
declined to permit the RÂ«i>ub icans to
take additional members sufficient to out*
vote the silver Republican < who bad
bolted the St. Louis convention and who
were now member? of the committees, if
they continued with the Democrats.
Short speeches were made by Senators
Hale, Gallinger. Wolcott. Wilson and
others. Senator Mason of Illinois claimed
that new Senators were entitled to com
mittee assignment, and that efforts should
be made to pi cc them. It the eff rts to
seat them failed there would be no blame
attaching to the Republicans.
Allison said that the situation had been
carefully canvassed, and while sufficient
votes to pass the necessary resolution
were not in sight, be said that the com
mittee hoped within a very short time
to be. able to say :hat the votes were at
hand to give the Republicans full control
of the membership of the committee.
Tiie result of the discussion was of a de
cidedly varied and somewhat nebulous
character.
A resolution instructing Chairman Alli
son to appoint a committee on commit
tees, whicn will assign Republicans to the
various committees on the basis insisted
upon by the Republicans, wag passed.
This will at least put the machinery in
motion and force the righting to a Gniib.
It is understood that a combination has
been floated by certain persons whereby
they are to vote with ihe Republicans on
the question of recognition. The Popu
lists who are to be given good chairman
ships are said to be Senators Jones of
Nevada, Stewart and Kyle. It is under
stood that Senator Hoar of Massachusetts
o pposes such a combination and will not
aggree to any recognition of the Populists
in the chairmanships.
ARBITRATION ARGUMENT.
It Seetn* , That the < Hilton Amendment
Â Will frtiraU.
: WASHINGTON, D.C., March 30.â The
last day of the debate on the amendments
that have been made to the general treaty
of arbitration concluded with the dis
cussion of this afternoon.
, To-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock the
vote will be taken on the amendments
that are pending up to that time, and the
next morning the amended copy of : the
treaty, if it shall have been amended, will
be laid before the Senate. The discussion
on these? amendments will i proceed : until
Thursday at 4 o'clock, when the final vote
on the amendment* then pending will be
taken; and after then â no further . amend
ments will be permitted. When the final
vote will be taken is a matter which can
not now be determined. The discussion
this afternoon was on the Chilton amend
ment, as for several days past.
It looks very much as if this amend
ment would prevail. Chilton addressed
the Senate to-day on his amendment, and
during the course of the discussion Plait
of Connecticut asked Chilton why his
proposed amendment was better than that
proposed by , the ; committee. f; Chilton , as
serted that It was better because it made
the intent of the Senate clearer and left
the s subject without k any } doubt in the
minds of the American people. .. ,-.
Senator Morgan made another of bis
speeches on the treaty as a whole and as
i - â â .-â ""â 'â --â â â ..:â â  --â â 'â * ' *'. '
sorted that it made no difference to him
how the convention was amended he
would be opposed to it. The rime had
not yet come, be sad, when the United
States should bind itself by a general
treaty with Great Britain. No goon c aid!
come o! it, and evi-rv man who considered
the interests of the United Slates would
vote against it.
iloar o( Massachusetts made a long
speech in fqvor ot it and offered a new
amendment to tune the place of the one
now pending. It <om prises the salient
features of tne Chiiton amendment and
the one proposed by the committee,
which had been informally agreed to. It
is patterned after the Lodge amendment
of the last se-sion and eliminates from me
scope of the treaty all questions relating
to the National or domestic policy of
either of the contracting parties ami pro
vides that the Senate shall pass, S3 a part
of the treaty-making power on all ques
tions proposed to hs submitted to arbitra
tion under the general terms of the treaty.
Hoar addressed the Senate at some length
upon his amendment.
Davis will to-morrow move an executive
session at an early hour.
HETTY GREEN AND SON.
The Richest tV.man in the United States
and Her Boy in Chicago to Look
After a Gigantic Lawsuit
CHICAGO, 111., March 30.â Mrs. Hetty
Green, the richest woman in tlie United
Siates, and her son, E. H. R. Green, pres
ident of the Texas Midland Railroad and
vice-chairman of the State Executive
Committee in Texas, are at the Great
Northern. They arrived yesterday. Mrs.
â¢Green came from New York and her son
from Washington, where he had been in
conference with the Republican leaders
with reference to the distribution of Fed
eral patronage in Texas.
Mother and son are in Chicago to await
the result of the lawsuit of Cornell vs.
Green, which comes up for trial in the
Federal court Thursday. Several million
dollars are involved.
Green said last night that President
McKmiey would not remove the Federal
office-holders of the South until affr the
expiration of their commissions. When
asked if he would take a hand in the dis
tribution of the offices, he intimated that
us far as the party ia concerned in Texas
he ia the "real thing."
Green ascribes the wonderful Republican
vote of Texas last year to the efforts of
the respectable element of his State to
cast aside partisanship and vote for prin
ciple. He firmly believes that Texas will
go Republican two year 3 hence. When
atked if be would be the Republican can
didate for Governor he said he did not
know. However, he thought that unless
the situation considerably changed he
would not object to giving the Democrats
a tight.
Green said there would be no railroad
building in the South to speak of in tne
present year. Texas, he declared, was the
most prosperous State at the present time
in the Union.
DELLA FOX FRAINTED.
The Popular Comic Opera Singer Over
ton** at â¢Â» HehrarMitl.
NEW YORK, N. V.. March 30.â Miss j
Delia Fox, who iÂ» shortly to appear in a I
comic opera entitled "The Weddiug Day,"
fainted on the stage while rehearsing at
the Casino yesterday. Dr. Austin Flint
Jr. was called in and advised that she be !
removed at once to her home.
The news of her illness at once spread
along the Rialto and lost nothing in the
telling. A few hours th- rumor was ;
going the rounds that Miss Fox was in an
exceedingly critical condition, and would
probably never h â  able to play again. It
was said that Dr. Flint had made irequent
calls at Miss Fox'B home during the day
and deemed ! her condition so serious that j
a professional nurse had been engaged to ;
take care of - the: actress. Dr. Flint was
s â â¢-!! last night.
- He said t at she was suffering from
nervous prostration, as the result of. over
work and worry concerning the new pro
duction. There was no occasion ior the i
alarming rumors of her condition, how- !
ever, . an he was: sure a -few clays' rest
would bring her aiour.d ail ricnt and
enable her to go on with the rehearsals.
Miss Fox lias not enjoyed the best of
health recently, and returned from a tour
on the road several weeks ago, during
which she played forty consecutive one
night stands. She was completely run
down and tired out, but at once began
studying and rehearsing her new part.
Her overtaxed nerves could not stand the
strain and her collapse" followed.' Her
managers said last night they had no
doubt she would be able to. resume re
hearsals short.
LAY ILL WITH HIS GOLD.
lii'corerv of a Sitter Hl>o Vat Dying
in Squalor.
MQRRISTOWN, N. J., March 30.â
tei Franz de Brand Jaillette, an old
French watchmaker who for years con
ducted a little jewelry-shop in Speed v.ell
avenue and occupied alone a little back
room, was removed to All Souls' Hospital
yesterday afternoon, critically ill from
pneumonia. The old man was a welt
known character about town for years and
his condition was only discovered by his
absence from his usual haunts. He lay
on an old bed in the dingy bacK room, sur
rounded by tilth and squalor, and for
long time refued to leave the place.
A search of the room after the man bad
been removed startled the searchers, for,
concealed in a box beneath a pile of rags,
they came upon over $9000 in gold, a num
ber of securities and .other valuable ar
ticles. â¢: The man will probably die, and as
he has no known relatives the rind will
probably produce considerable litigation
to determine to whom it s;>oula go.

CRUELTY ON THE OAKES.
federal Authorities ill Protrcute Cap-
Ci-. â â¢>'"":;;" 'â  titin . He'd. â  '
NEW YORK, N. V.. March United
States District Attorney McFarlane said
yesterday "- that an investigation into the
cases of alleged cruelty on the part of
Captain Reed of the ship T. F. Oakes,
which came into port recently yith sev
eral of the crew dead and several seriously
ill irom scurvy, was being made with a
view of securing indictments against Cap
tain Reed should the facts warrant it.
The statuie which Captain Reed is said to
have violated is that relating to the dis
tribution of food and lime juice to the
men. . '
'i Samuel A. Fraser and Churles Robin
son, seamen of the Oakes, went from the
marine hospital at (Statin Island, where
they have been laid up with scurvy, to the
office of George. C. Bodine, a lawyer, to see
if a ciiruinal or civil suit for damages
| could be instituted against Captain Reed.
They also went to District McFarlane's
office, where a statement was taken from
I each man. Bodine says that if any ac
tion is brought he will sue in behalf of the
eleven survivors of the crew and the fam
ilies of Thomas Ring and A. Judge, who
said in their wills, which named Frasar
and Robinson as ' executors, that they
were being Htarved to death.
A delegation from the Seamen's Union
appeared before District Attorney McFar
lane yesterday and urged him to prosecute
Captain Reed. It is said that Harry
Reagan, third mate of trie Oaken, will
bring suit for damages against the cap
tain.
TWO PEOPEE BURNED TO DEATH.
Heroic Effort* of firemen to Save Them
Here in rain.
NEW YORK, N. V.. March 30.â Fire
destroyed a' â¢'â â / frame house on Carroll
sireet, near Franklin avenue, Brooklyn,
early this morning. Peter Keenan, aged
40, and Marie Stewart, aged 5, were burned
to death in bed.
Every effort was male by the heroic tire
men to save the lives of the two unfortu
nates, but in vain. Several times they at
tempted to enter the house, but the smoke
drove them back.
Those who saw the fire say that it was
one of the quickest they ever witnessed.
It seemed but a very few moments from
the first alarm before the flames com
pletely enveloped the building and pre
vented any one fro.m entering. It was an
old frame building and the wood was dry
and well seasoned. Just what started the
tire no one knows. It is thought, how
ever, that it may have been a match from
the hands of some thoughtless cigarette
smoker. It is believed. that the two peo
ple died painlessly and the fire surprised
them in bed. . ,

IN A TWENTY-ROUND BOUT.
</,><-'; Everhardt and Kid McPartland
J-'itht to a flraw.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 30 âAfter a
very fierce battle at t 1 c Broadway Ath
letic Club to-night Ke/eree Kochc decided
the twenty-round bout between Jack
Everhardt of Ne-v Orleans and Kid Jlc-
Partland of this city a draw. Everhardt
did mosi of the leading, but McPartland
stood him off well.
In the seventeenth the Xi 1 should have
soi the fight on a technical foul, as one of
Everliardt's seconds came into the rinc
while the men were clenched, but Me-
Paitland fouled Jack two or three times
by hitting below the belt in tho same
round.
Notwithstanding the attempt at an in
juncion by a rival club, there was a fair
crowd present. The betting was about
cv n money, as the sports took a line on
both men through LaVigne.
T.io preliminary waÂ« a ten-round en
counter between Jimmy Tnlly and Jimmy
Kelly, both of this city. Tul'ly got the de
cision.
The second pair were Jack Hanley of
Philadelphia and Jack Foley of Boston.
They were scheduled for ten rounds at
135 pounds. Foley knocked his man out
la two minutes and hity-eiÂ«nt seconds of
the fourth round and won. The blow was
a rifjbt swine on the jaw and Hanly was
tnocked unconscious. His was a very Dad

rinp. He vomited freely and it took the
club's doctor a long time to bring him
back to consciousness.

FORAKER'S BILL
PERMITS POOLIN?
Certain Conditions Under
Which Railroads May
Enter Contracts.
But All Their Acts Are to Be
Approved by a Commission
to Be Created.
Due Notice Must B-> Given Before
Rates Are Increased or MateÂ»
rially Rduced.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 30.â 1n
the Senate to-day Foraker of Oliio intro
duced a bill that permits railroad pooling
under certain conditions. They are per
mitted to enter into contracts, agree
ments, etc., enforcible by the parties,
provided that such agreements shall be In
writing and filed with the commission
created by this act, and shall become law
ful ana enforcible between tbe part.es
thereto at the expiration of twenty days
from the filine thereof, unless the conunis
sion shall in the meantime make an order
disapproving of such agreement. Sued
disapproval is required when an investi
gation abows that the proposed agreetaefr "w
would result in unreasonable rates or!
otherwise contravene any provision of tbe JP
act. The commission is given authority
to revise or modify the rates established if
investigation proves the necessity for
such modification, or it may order the
agreement to be terminated at a fixed
('.ate.
The orders and findings of the commis
sion are made subject to review by a;iy
Circuit Court of the United States sitting
in equity in a judicial district in which
any party to the contract has its principal
offices. An appeal may be taken to the
Supreme Court of ihe United States.
The further details of the bill require
ihe conspicuous posting of all tariff
sheets, rates, etc. No advance can be
made in rates except upon ten days' pub
lic notice, wbica must state the chances
proposed to be made, the time when they
will go into effect, etc. Reduction* in
rates can only be made after three days'
public notice, and trie same provisions
apply to joint rates and tariffs.
It is made lawful for common carriers,
whether subject to this act or not, to
enter into agreements not forbidden by
the fifth section of tbe interstate com
merce act in regard to the making and
maintaining of tbe lawful rates and
charges specified in tbe separate or joint
tariff schedules published as required by
this section. The remaining sections of
the bl! relate to matters of detail and
are similar to the provisionsof the Patter
son bill introduced and reported in the

JACKSON, Miss.. March 30.â From the
great Yazoo-Mis-'i'-sippi delta comes a
wail of distress, and the cry "The levees
have broken" is beam throng the val
ley of the Niles. â  Three frt- sti breaks have
been reported to-day, through which rush
immense volumes of water, carrying death
and dcs ruction to thousands of homes ;
and devastating as fertile a territory as is j
to be found on the tlobe. So far no loss |
of life except to domestic animals has j
been reported, but may be by morning, as ;
the great mound of earth wnich protects j
the flonrisb'n:: cities o; Greenville, Rose
dale, Stoneville, Arcola, Friar Point, Roll- â 
ing Fork and others are water-soaked,
mushy and liable to give way at any ;
moment.
The four breaks that have occurred have
flooded and will flood before reaching the I
mouth of the Y;.zoo, perhaps a week
hence, the counties of Bolivar, Washing
. ton, Sharkey, Issaquenna, Yazoo and
portions of others, in which are comprised i
the finest cotton farms in the world. In:
this overflowed district the State has
leased eight plantations, and upon which, I
with her able-bodied convicts, she was
preparing 10 make another crop of cotton I
and corn, the latter being in tine condi- i
lion.
The creates*, concern is for the city of ;
Greenville, which, situated as it is in the i
hollow of a crescent formed by the bend ,
of tiie river and surrounded by it on two â¢
sides, would be wiped out of existence
should a break occur in the immediate i
vicinity.
The streets of the city are twelve feet
below the summit of the levee, so that, a
break once formed, there would be no
way of stopping tise niagara, and every :
house in the place would be swept from j
its foundations and the remaining in- >
habitants, it is feared, hurled into eter
nity.
Fearing such a catastrophe those who i
could have migrated to the hills, but '
thousands still remain. The breaks that!
occurred to-day are both above and below j
Greenville fifteen and twenty-five mile*,
so that the water will pass to the rear of !
the city.
The streams on the delta all flow from I
the river and down the opposite side of \
the valley. The topography of the coun
try is level, but sloping east and away '
from the river for forty miles, in some
places to the Tazoo, and it if through this '.
stream i he overflow water must co to again
rrac:i the Mississippi, seventy-five to one
hundred miles south of where it has left
it. Thousands of people, white and black, i
still line the levees and are making a dcs- !
perate effort to hold what remains. The j
water is reported higher than ever before
known from Memphis to Vicfcsburg.
o HURON. S. D., March There has ;
been a four-foot rise in the Jim River here |
in the past twenty-foui hours. It is now j
only four inches below the hieti water- ;
mark of 1831 and is rapidly rising.
Several bridges have gone out and others j
will go when the ice moves. Railway I
bii>iges are safe. Losses from wrecked

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1897.
RAILROADS GET
SHARP NOTICES
Must Forward Information
to the Interstate
Commission.
Aided by the Chicago Board of
Trade 0 ficials Will Look
Into Rate Cutting.
R val Companies Maintain Bureaus to
Carry on a System of
Spying.
CHICAGO. 111.. March 30.-All the
Eastern railroads which enter Chicago,
except the Chicago and Grand Trunk,
have received notices from the Interstate
Commerce Commission to forward to the
olice at Washington on or before April
10 all bills of lading and other evidence of
shipment of grain and srain products
and packing-house products between April
1, 1896, and March 1, 1397.
This notice created some surprise and
concern among the freight officials, who
had been inclined to treat lightly the pub
lished announcement that the Commerce
Commission, aided by the Chicago Board
of Trade investigation next month, in
tended to make a searching inquiry into
the giving of reduced rates.
The om sjion of the Grand Trunk from
the list was agreed to by a mistake,
although the first impression gave rise to
general charges that this road bad been
foremost in rate-cutting. Chicago offi
cials say the evidence desired will be pre
pared as soon as possib:e, and they are
afraid to be caught lurnishing false state
ments to the commission.
An important meeting of presidents,
| general officials and trallic men connected
; with Western roads will be held in the
j Rookery to-morrow. It is understood that
the plan to be carried out in view of the
Supreme Court's recent decision has also
been prepared by acomra ttee. The prop
osition is to maintain the Western Freight
Association as a bureau of statistics and
i information. This is rendered iircessary
' chiefly because the five members of the
| Board of Administration are under a two
years' contract to the association at sal
aries of $10,000 each, and the railroads
cannot mi ize their services in any other
manner. To the railroads interested the
j bureau will really be for the purpose of
j forcing the maintenance of uniform rates
i by each road acting as a spy and informer
I on the others and threatening exposure to
1 the Interstate Commerce Commission for
< every s?cet violution of the law in mafe
-1 inp discriminatory rates which may be
i discovered by a competitor. There Is to
be a verbal contract embracing the salient
! features of the present agreement, omit
ting the direct penalty clause. This
agreement to inform on violators of the
I Jaw is considered the only way to prevent
[ secret rate-cutting.
PasÂ«enger officials of Western roads
met to-doy and decided to continue the
nu'eage and clergy permit bureaus of the
j Western Passenger Association. The
j general organization will be maintained
for tlie purpose of compiling statistics
j and disseminating them for the benefit of
I the members.
Suveral general passenger agents of
Western roads were here to-day on their
wav to New York to aitend a meeting of
railroad men to consider the division of
westbound passenger traffic.
LAWYERS IN CONFERENCE.

NKW YORK, N. V., March 30. -An im
portant conference between members of
the Joint Traffic Association was h Id to
a.iy in the offices of Cater & Ledyard, on
Wall street. Tne conference was at
tended by attorneys from almost every
railroad included in the Joint Traffic
Association and was for the purpose of

The lawyers to-day endeavored to dis

STREET FIGHT IN SEATTLE.
Ex-County Officials Involved in Embezzle
ment Scandals Indulge in a
Knockdown.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 30.â As the
coils tighten and pinch the band of ex
county officials accused and under sus
picion in the matter of the county fund
embezzlement scandals those affected
grow restive and irritable. This afternoon
there was a veritable "knock-down-and-
drag-out" street ripht, tne scene being the
entrance to Hyams, Panson & Co.'s Btore
on First avenue.
Ex-Deputy Auditor Nathan Beman, in
whose office big shortages have been un
earthed, approached unawares ex-Deputy
Auditor .Levi Smith, who is under indict
ment for the peculation, and dealt him a
sturm Ing blow in the face, breaking
his eyeglasses. Smith, recovering his
equilibrium, Knocked Beman down.
Mutual friends parted the combatants,
but a lew moments later hostilities were
renewed, B eman again being the aggressor.
For this trouble he was again sent to
eras?, but he arose and assaulted Edward
Brady o f the law linn of Brady & Gay,
counsel for Smith.
Beman then turned once more to Smith.
George Noble, city salesman Jor Schwa
bacher Bros. & Co., sought to declare
peace, and for his pains was abused until
hÂ« checked the flow of epithets by giving
Beman his third knockdown.
By this time live or six other persons,
friends of the combatants, were preparing
to take a hand, and were prevented from
doing so only by the timely arrival of the
pslice. No arrests were mad*.
During the melee Beman toole occasion
to tell Smith that he and several ex
county officials who were aiding in his
defense vert and hau always been a band
of thieves.
Bad blood exists between Smith and ex-
Dfputy Auditor Frame A. Twichell, in
whose office also big shortages have teen
found. Smiti , who was likewise a deputy
under Twichell, is charged with these
stealings.

BUDD RETURNS TO STOCKTON.
Reports the D.scovery of a Serious
Error in the County Govern
ment Bill.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 30.â Governor
Budd arrived to-day from Sacramento,
where he has been engaged in looking
over the bills passed by the Legislature
and now awaiting his signature. He has
aimed to give each bill a careful reading
three times to lessen the liability of over
looking any small "bugs' 1 which mitht
be concealed in them. There still remain
almost 100 bills which must undergo the
final scrutiny. Tne period in which these
must be signed or vetoed will exuire next
Thursday. The Governor believes that
eighty or a hundred of the bills will ;iot
meet with his approval â an unusually
large number for tiie chief executive to
table, by the way.
'â¢What is to be the fate of the county
government bill?" was asked of Governor
Budd shortly after his arrival here.
"I can't tell you about that at the pres
ent time," he replied.
"I have not finally decided on it as
yet. There are a great many things to be
said in favor of it and some against it."
"Have you discovered any more 'bugs'
in the bills?"
"Yes, and a big oneâ that is, an Im
portant one. It depends on the difference
between the words 'to' and 'by' â a differ
ence that changes the entire meaning of a
law.' 1
The Governor added that he believed
the mistake crept in accidentally. It is in
the bill concerning the asses-ment ot rai
roads under lease. It was proposed to re
lieve the lessor of some of the tax, (he
portion thus taken off the lessor's assess
ment to be added to the lessee's. But
there is either an ellipsis of several words
or the word "by" should be changed to
"to in order to accomplish the desired
object. As the bill reads it would throw
all the tax of the leased road upon the
lessor.

little or no changes had been made. In
speaking of one of the preachers' meet

said: "They are very Jarge. Why, at
the one I attended there were 200 or 3JO
in attendance. Reporters are excluded,
but it is a notable fact that whenever
anything particular happens the great
dailies always have a full account ot it
all, which only goes to Drove that there
is no earthly sense in shutting them out

Dr. Beard of Grace Church then rose
and said that he thought the present
meetings were in need of a reformer; that
ii one gave up a morning to the meeting
he wanted to hear something worthy of
deep thought. Dr. Bentley of Berkeley
said he thoroughly agreed with Dr. Beard.
Dr. Case, in giving his opinion on the sub

that have been read that were objecteG to,
but the papers that should have and nave

Jesse Hunter Brings Action to
Recover Valuable City-
Property.
The Defendant One Who Three De
cades Alter Their Marriage Coa
less;d Herj-e'.f a Bigamist.
. f.OS ANGELES, Cal., March 30.â A
Fuii of peculiar interest and involving
reminiscences of forty years ago and a
romance with marital complications, was
begun here to-day before Judge Allen of the
Superior Court. The action was brought
by Jesse Hunter against Jane Elizabeth
Milan to recover property deeded to de
fendant by plaintiff in the value of ?;>.),C00.
Hunter sets forth that on July 3, 1*62, a
marriage was solemnized between the
plaintiff and defendant by J. D. Wood
worth, a Justice of the Peace, and after
ward the certificate of marriage was re
corded. At the time of the wending the
defendant had been married to and was
the lawful wile of Joseph Milam and the
ceremony of marriage between the plaintiff i
and the defendant was for that reason
void, but Hunter coniiuued to be ignorant
of the lact, believing the proceedings to
have beea legal. On the other hand
the defendant knew all the time
that the marriage ceremony was null and
to id.
in IS7S Hunter believed he was near to
death and deeded to his wife a lot on the
west side of Fort street, now Broadway,
on which stands the M. E. Church. Hun
ter did not die, but continued to live on
the Fort-street lot until 1883. This prop
erty had been inheiited by Hunter from
his father.
In 1883 the defendant confessed to
Hunter that at the time of their marriage
she was the wife of Joseph Milam, and
that the latter was -*till alive and sne had
not been divorced from him. Tnis was a
great t-hock to Hunter. He declined to
live with her longer, and since that date
they have never lived together as man
and wife.
The separation caused the woman to
bring an action for divorce from her real
husband, Milam. The decree was granted
on March 29, 1884. Tue deed of the Fort
street property was subsequently set aside
and a new deed made out in the name of
Jane Elizabeth ToniDkins. Tuis property
was to be t>ers daring hei life, and in case
she survived him (Hunter) it should go
to her heirs. Until February 10, 1592,
thedefendan; laid no claim to the prop
erty in question other than a lffe interest,
but since that date she lias claimed the
Droperty by virtue of the deed originally
made to her. Now Hunter asks the court
to declare both deeds void and that each
De canceled.
The story of Mr?. Hunter's marriage
with Milrtm involves another romantic.
S;ie was living with her parents in 1556, in
San Bernardino County. The latter, be
coming dissatisfied, decided to return to
i^ak Lake, they twine Mormons. The cirl
did not want to return and concluded that
if she got married her leaving California
would be prevented. Sne bad the oppor
tunity to wed Josepn Milanf and did so.
They liv<-d together two weeks, when her
parents compelled her to accompany them
back to Salt Lake. Milam then left for
Santa Cruz. Many years laier Mrs. Milam
returned to this State and married Jesse
Hunter. It is said that Milam is still
alive.

Body of a Man Who Disappeared in
January Fcund in the IV/ncoche

MONTESA.nO, \\ ash., March 30.â What
had hiiherto been supposed to be a mur
der was accounted for in the finding yes
terday of the body of Edmund F. Silage in
the Wynooche River. His body was found
lodged in a drift at tin; south pier of the

and an Indian canoe, and started up the
Wynooche Kiver.
The next morning pieces of the canoe
and parts of the outlit were caught a short
distance below where he was known to
have camped the night before. Tbose
seeing him say that he was certainly un
used to handling an Indian canoe, tut his
having money on his person led many to
believe that he was foully dealt with. At
the Coroner's inquest last night every
thing pointed to accidental drowning and
a verdict to that effect was rendered.
On the body were found $4 85 in silver, a
watch, pocket-book with letters and about
an ounce of gold dust. At the hotel hÂ£re

STANFORD'S PRESIDENT LECTURES
Dr. Jordan Declares the Bering Sea
Arbitration at Paris to Have Been
Fare cat.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 30. â A crowded chapel greeted Dr.
Jordan this evening when he delivered
the lectare which he had promised the
students before his last trip to Washing*
ton. He spoke on "The Fur Seal as an
International Issue." la substance he
said:
The fur seal was discovered in 1741 by Stel
ler. Pribilof found the Pribilof herd in 1780.
In the early days the Russian-Anierican Com
pany saw tnat the female sealÂ« were preserved.
Even in the lawless period from 1780 to 1870
only the young males were killed.
The Alaska Commercial Company existed
from 1870 to 1890. The industry whs contin
ued under improved couditlons and the de
mand lor sealskins increased. This company's
quota was 10.000 skins a year. In 1880-there
were about 2,000,000 seals ou Pribilof Island.
Of these (500,000 were breeding females. Pel
agic sealing was then inaugurated. For every
animul killed and captured at sea six are
killed and lost. While the North American
Commercial Company was in existence the
herd steadily declined.
The United States complained of the treat
ment of the herds and four pelagic sealers
were seized. England protested. The modus
Vivendi, which provided that neither England
nor America should kill seals on land or sea,
was put into operation for two years. Belore
the Paris tribunal of arbitration America
claim -a the Bering Sea and the ownership of
the fur-seal herd, and also that killing the
sec 1 â¢hi land only wus necessary to preserve
the h^rds. The British denied all the cluims
of the United Slates. The tribunal did not
fully understand the question. The evidence
brought before it would disgrace any court In
any country. The whole artitration was
simply an attempt to smooth the matter over
and make it look well. There was no attempt
to give Justice to either side.
The tribunal decided that the United States
did not own Bering Sea. It must pay owners
of vessels sei2e<i. ThÂ£ animals were wild and
wild animals belonged 10 no one except when
on land. It wag the duty cf the nations to
protect the herds, and regulations for tneir
protection and preservation were adopted.
Oi these the only regulation of consequence
was that which provided for a re-exnmination
of the matter by Great Britain and the United
States every five yers. Englr.nd sent a com
mission of ab.e scientists for this ex.imiua-
tion. I was asked to head the commission
representing the United â¢ States. .The high
character of the British. Commission and fav
orable public conditions lead me to believe
that the -matter will be settled by arbitration.
There is no settlement which does not abso
lutely prohibit pelagic sealing. It can be pre
vented by branding the females if diplomacy
is of no avail.
LITTLE DAMAGE BY FROST.
Except in Scattered Localities No Harm
to Crops Resulted From the Cold
Weather.
TULARE, Cal., March 30.-A blighting
frost visited this section last night. Many
opinions are expressed as to Its effect, but
that some fruit was killed seenls certain.
At the Morion ranch east of town
j the thermometer registered 23 degrees;
at other places 2<> and 29 were noted. One
orchardist examined ICMJO peacb buds and
reports all killed. At tde Paige orchard
the superintendent stated that the ex
tent of the damage could not yet be de
termined. Apricots ana early peaches
are undoubtedly damaged.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 30.â The dam
age done by the cold weather lip this im-
I mediate vicinity has not been as severe as
might have been expected. Of vegetables
the only variety that has suffe-ed is the
potato, the season being too early for the
planting of any of the other summer vege
tables. Potato- planting began quite re
cently, and as yel tne acreage is com
paratively small. Those vines which had
shown above ground were killed. Lim
ited damage seems to have been done to
the almond crop, as the nuts are well ad
vanced. Perhaps the tr?es that felt the
â  cold the most are the apricots, but it is
! not believed that they were injured much.
j It will be several days before the extent of
: the damage is known accurately, as the
j effect does not manifest itself until the
blossoms begin to fall.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 30.â Jack
Frost hfts never seriously bothered San
Diesro or the bay region, because its semi
periodical visits to this latitude have uni
formly been confined to ihe river valleys
] and low spots, where there are no citrus
groves and where he could damage noth
ing more valuable than vegetables. Con
sequently the sudden drop in temperature
this morning caused i:either alarm nor
! damage in this vicinity. The thermome
j ter at the United States Weather Bureau
| office registered 39.5 degrees, an-! early
< risers say some of the board sidewalks
i were white; that was all. No one arose
to smudge his orange orchard, because it
did not need it.
FRESNO VINEYARDISTS JUBILANT.
Ways and Means Lomm.t.ee Recommends
a 2- Cent Duty on Zante
Currants.
FRESNO. Cal., March 30.â The vine
yardists of Fresno County will be jubilant
in the morning when they read the news
that the Ways and Means Committee of
Congress has recommended a duty of 2
j cents a pound on Z uite cnrrants, an in
' crease of } j cent on the rate first proposed.
| The growers have a delegation consisting
| of Dr. Rowell and Colonel Forsyth, assi<t
j ed by General Chipman in Washington,
I to work for a higher tariff on the Grecian
j product.
This afternoon a telegram was received
from Dr. Ro*e!l stating that the delega
tion had failed in its purpose. This was
very disappointmc news, for without a
j sufficient tariff the low-priced Grecian
currants would compete with Caliiornia
raisins in ihe Eastern markets. Tins
evenine another telegram was received
from Dr. Roweil, to the effect that the
Wiiys and Means Committee had recon
sidered ana recommended a duty of 2
cents. With a tariff on raisins un 2%
cents and 2 cents on currants the Tint
yardists are satisfied.
SAN RAFAEL MAN'S
WEALTH HAS GONE
Millionaire Finigan Cannot
Pay Alimony to
His Wife.
Money Must Ec Forthcoming or
He Will Be Adjudged
Guilty of Contempt.
Plaintiff Offers Proof That the Defend
ant Is Possessed of Great Wealth
in Mines and Land.
SAN RAFAEL, Cat,., March 3o.â Colonel
Peter A. Finigan has been granted until
April 3 to pay $750 to his wife as alimony
and counsel fees and if the money i 9 not
forthcoming on that aate Colonel Finigan
will ba guilty of contempt of court and
will be compelled to accept punishment
which may not be to his liking. To-day
in the Snperior Court of Marin County
Colonel Finigan swore that he was with
out the means to comply with Judge An
gelotti's decree and the Judge allowed
him the extra time in wnich to change
his mind.
Mrs. Emily B. Finigan is suing her
husband for a divorce. She made a show
ing before Superior Judge Angelotti that
her husband wa-* in receipt oi an income
of $1000 a month, and that he was living
with his daughter at the Hotel Rafael,
and spendinc money lavishly. Mrs. Fin
igan's attorneys, under this showing,
asked tnat an allowance be ordered by
Judge Angelotti of $1500 for attorney's
feeF, $300 a month alimony, and $300 for
costs of suit. Judge Angelotti cut this
down to $750, and made out an order di
recting Finigan to pay this sum to-day,
or be adjudged guilty of contempt of
court. Finigan did not produce the
money, and Judge Angeiotti allowed him
until "the 3d of April.
The Finigan divorce case has attracted
considerable attention, both on account
of the prominence of the parties and their
wealth, Colonel Finigan being classed as
one oi California's millionaires. The case
was to have been heard this week, out the
contempt proceedings have caused a
delay. Mrs. Finigan was allowed $100 a
month alimony, pending the outcome of
the iitipniion.
Mrs. Finigan in her complaint alleges
that her husband is unreasonably jealous,
and accuses him of doing all sorts of
things, much to her mental anguish. She
even alleges that he kept a pistol under
his pillow when they were abroad, and
frightened her, and assigns this as one of
the causes of her poor health.
She further says that ihe colonel accused
her of flirting and neglecting him in order
to win the admiration of others. Sne
stoutly denies this. The colonel denies
everything.
Mr. lJunn^. one of Mrs. Finigan's attor
neys, supplied proof that the defendant
owned a mine in Cixlavpra* County worth
in the neighborhood of $100,000. and $30,000
worm of real estate in Alameua County.

BOOKING THE PUGS,
The Olympic Club Offers $4000
for a Fight Between Greei
and Ryan.
Yesterday afternoon the Olympic Ciub
held its sixth special meeting purposely
to discuss the proposition of matching
Tommy Ryan and George Green. Green,
it appears, is willing to fieht the Eastern
man for any fair purse, bat .Ryan has re
fused all offers that have been made to
him by the Olympics, and a particular
friend of Tommy's telegraphed the club
on Monday that Ryan wonld not meet
Green on this coast unless he was guaran
teed a $5000 purse and expenses.
After a long discussion over dollars and
cents, the directors finally decided to give
Douglas White full power to act, and he
was instructed to telegraph the Jast ofter
the club will make to Ryan, ami that is a
purse of $4000 and $500 for expenses. If
the Eastern welter-weight will refuse this
proposition, the club will then conclude
that Ryan has no groat fancy to enter a
ring against the Californian for reasons
that are best known to himself.
Tne National Club haÂ« beon seriously
thinking of matching "Parson" Davies'
colored heavy-weight pugilist, Bob Arm
strong, against "our boy" Joe McAuiiffe.
But Joseph, when approached upon the
subject, stated without any hesitation !
that he was out of the fighting business,
and was perfectly saii-tied to rest on his
laurels for the balance of his life. Tne
club will substitute Sam Fruit, another
bie colored tighter who has been knocking
about the c uniry for some time, for Me
Auliffe, and the big colored guvs in pu
gilism will measure arms on the evening
ol April 23. Jimmy Barry and Jimmy
Anthony, the bantams, will box fifteen
rounds on the same evening, and accor.i
ing to the agreement they entered inio
Monday evening, they will toe the scratch
at 115 pounds.

STOCKTON, Cat,.. March 30.â A bold

miles south of this city. The residence of
J. J. Borland was entered by a cracksman

ON TO SAN JOSE"
Enthusiastic Meeting of the
Boulevard Association
at the Baldwin.
Committees Appointed to Look
' After the Soliciting Com
mittees.
Mr. Fay Says if the Road Is Carried
to the County Line Santa Clara
Will Take It to San Jose.
The called meeting of the Boulevard
Association was held last evening at the
Baldwin Hotel to tike united action
toward booming the boulevard movement,
creating a wider interest in ire enterprise
and raising funds for the double purpose
of employing those who need the work
and the money they can earn in complet
ing a great public improvement.
There were a number of those piesentby
invitation who were not members of the
association, but who have been active in
collecting funds and otherwise assisting
the work, among them W. H. Bunker,
yljijppman Kachs mid Mr. Schussler of the
MB uÂ»^' Valley Water Company, and J.
â HFay, member of the City. Council of
wn Jose.
' 'A number of addresse* were made full
of enthusiasm in lie work accomplished
and suEcestions for prosecuting it with
the vigor necessary to carry it to comple
tion. Harold Wheeler named as the
greatest need of the moment a live com
mittee to keep track of and whip up the
other soliciting committees. To this Mr.
Bunker and Air. Fay ana others sub
tcribed, and the following were named to
perform that duty: T. G. Taylor, Mai
Popper and C. W. McAfee.
C. S. Crittenden suggested that a com
mittee be named to solicit a day's income
from all the livery stables. Also that a
uay's lacing be arranged at Ingleside for
local horsemen. The Golden G3te Riding
Club could be enlisted, he thought, and a
great many tickets sold. This suggestion
also met with favor, and the following ;
committee on the project was named: G.
S. Crittenden, Alex McCord, Jotin Mur
phy, W. E. Briggfl and Edward Kelly.
This committee will also sÂ°e the wheel
men and try to enlist their efforts.
Mr. .ray made a stirring little speecn, in
which be said the work was progressing
famously, and those in charge were al
most in sight of the promised land. He
expected it to keep moving until the
bun evÂ«rd reach d the county line, when
he would see that the strings were pulled
in Santa Clara to carry if. to San Jose,
which, doubtless, stands in his eyes for
the promised land.
Mr. Scuus*ler in a short address sug- !
gested that the big fill in the road be made
suxty feet wide for the present, thus great
ly reducing the expense.
Secretary Ma uire read the following
report which wa3 received with applause:
March 30, 1897.
To the President and Members of the Boulevard
Association: Your committee ou "supervision
and construe Ion" lake this opportunity to
â Ã¼bmit you their report of what we have ac
complished and of what we have tinker way
in the shape of progress toward the great ends
to accomplish which our association was
formed. We have a. ways to keep In view the
objects of the association, namely: â ' '. f> "'
Firstâ To- originate and aid measures tend
ing to put the driveways of the City and
County 01 San Francisco in the best possible
condition for the cenerai uses of the public.
Second â To devise, consider And recommend
such legislation and municipal and other
measures as may seem wise and expedient lor
'the improvement of the existing roods, and
for building of new driveways and boulevards
In this county. -
Thirdâ To aid and assist the proper officials
In carrying out laws and ordinances concern
ing the proper care and maintenance of the
roads.
Yonr committee was largely instrumental
In having the contract to construct the
â¢'Ocean Boulevard" let, and the work brought
to a successful issue; and in tbis connection
we wish to say: Tne board of Park Commis
sioners and the superintendent of 'he park,
Mr. McLaren, acted with us to bring this i
about, and used every means to make it a per
fect driveway. This bouievard runs from the
park along the great highway on the ocean
chore some three miles or mop-, and connects
with the Ocean House road. When this work
was completed we found that it would be nec
essary to build a connecting piece of roadway
with an t-asy grade to connect these two roads.
We succeeded in having an authorization
passed by the Board of Supervisors to have the
work done by our association, and the work
paid for by tiie City. Tnis has all been done,
and we can congratulate the association in
having seen the completion of one of the finest
bits of roadway in the country.
Your committee has in hand an additional
work by which the connecting piece between
the Ocean House road and the Ocean boule
vard will be greatly improved. The present
connection involves some bad turns and un-
BRtisiaeiory grades, and to avoid this we have
arranged to extend the Ocean House road in a
Ftraignt line west 10 'he ocean, and to extend
Oceun boulevard south to meet H. We are as
sured of tne necessary rights of way for this
' t>urp<"s?â by grant from the Spring Valley
Water Works â and expect to be able to arrange
for ihc actual making of this change in the
neariuture. â 
The Park Commissioners also carried out
their promise!) made to us in the matter of
opening of a roadway from the park drive on
the south side leading out to Seventh avenue.
This gives a necessary and comfortable en
trance way leading to end from the South
drive.
Seventh avenue, which leads from the park
to the Aimshouse road, has been graded, mac
adamized and curbed from II street up to the
"waste pond" of the water company at X
iÃtreet. This has been a long-delayed and
Li'iow piece of work to accomplish, as many
interests were concerned in the matter and
many points had to be arrived at and settled
beiore the way was found clear to bring the
work through. This avenue is completed
right up to the brink of the "waste pond."
While this work was being carried through it
was necessary to have a temporary roadway.
' and we were compelled to ask the Board of :
(supervisors to help us out in the case, which
they did by appropriating $150, which we
spent to have the temporary road built.
From the waste pond we wish to carry Sev
enth avenue rieht through, and this would
necessitate tbe filling in of the "waste pond"
and the Rradinsdown of the hill somewhatâ
a considerab.e work and one In which we
have found the interested property-owners
slow to move. The water company is the
party most at Interest here, and we . are
pleaded to Â«ay that we have the most encour
aging assurances from Mr. Sch ussier, and |
have every reason to believe the work will De I
prosecuted with success.
Talcing op the road, then, at the south end
of the '"waste pond," we are assured that the
Spring Valley Water Company will arrange
with a private contractor at itÂ« own expense
to widen and grade and macadamize the road
way. The water company has already very
generously deeded to the City enoaeh land to
properly widen the road through to the Alms
oust; property.
Ex-Mayor A. Sutro has been urged . to aid us
in building this great road by giving us the
right of way through his lands to reach the
Corbett road : without the long, slow, uphill
and downhill route we have used so long. He
recognized the great public benefits to be thus
derived, and most magnanimously set aside
nd ha* row given a deed to this City for < a
grand strip of land, which will connect the
Aimshouse with the Corbett road near the
Irocadero. , In addition to this public; gift, he
has at all times assisted us In this enterprise
with his engineers, and in many ways helped
us to success. He is also furnishing us volun
tarily with the rock from his quarry to mac
adamize the road. ; " â  , 'â 
The purpose of your committee In laying out
this boulevard was to obtain and construct ft
road leading from the park, at Seventh ave
nue, past Lake: Honda to; the Corbett road,
pear the "Trocadcro." connecting therew ith
t'je Jairleside road and with the Ocean House
read, It was determined ,to make the new
boulevird a road of tt-e very fim class, of am
ple width and of easy and practical t grades.
Accordingly a width of 100 feet, from Seventh
avenue to Joglesid9, ' Jibs : been provided for,
arid the grades at different points have ; been
to changed from the natural or established
grades as to mnke the maximum r Â» de , on the
boulevard only 4 per cent or thereabouts, me
established grade at L street was for this pur
pose raised ten feet. And for the purpose
getting the full width lor the road we have se
cured from the Harmon estate a grant of fif
teen feet along ; Seventh avenue, from L street
to Lake Hondo, and a corresponding conces
sion on the other side. '-; S J A - .
For more than a year past your committee
has been engatred in laying out and making
the arrangements for this proposed boulevard,
and after com(.letir.g these arrangements was
then confronted witn the problem of raising
the necessary funds to carry on the work, and
the opportunity we desired came with the
recent public movement for tho relief of the
"unemployed." Mayor Phelan having ap
pointed a committee to take in hand this mat
ter of the unemployed, that 1 ; committee deter
mined to collect iunds for the purpose and to
appjythe funds toward the construction of
the boulevard which we had projected, ac
complishing in this way the double result of
assisting the needy and of obtaining for the
public and for the City a splendid < and valu
able Improvement.
The Mayor's committee organized with W.
M. Bunker its chairman and ex-Mayor L R.
Ellert as chairman of finances. These two
gentlemen have since then devoted their time
and energy unselfishly to the collection by
voluntary subscriptions of a fund to pay the
unemployed, 'ihey turned the construction
over to our own construction committee, add
ing thereto Harold Wneeler. The work of
building this boulevard has now been in full
operation for the past ten days, and we have
upward of 500 men a day employed thereon,
to whom is paid $1 a day and 10 cents lor car
fare. None of the money is used for any pur
pose except to pay for labor, as all the neces
sary tools and supplies are being contributed
by our liberal citizens. Superintendent Reddy
of the Aim* house also furnishes daily at the
noon hour soup for all the laborers. The great
work is progressing favorably, and the assur
ance of its completion within the next sixty
days is unquestioned, providing the necessary
funds are collected.
Your construction committee have worked
uucea*-ingly to accomplish this much during
tha past year. We have held meetings of some
kind nearly every day during that time; we
have appeared before the Board of Supervisors,
the Part Commissioners, the Street Committee,
tue' water officials. Mayor tsutro and many
others and have given our efforts to accom
plish our ends. Since the actual construction
lof the boulevard was commenced we have
been out there, personally "supervising the
work during n part oi each day. We now asK
each member ot this association to aid us to
collect money enough to complete this boule
vard. Many "thousand dollars more are needed
a.nd many families are still in distress and the
$1 will go a long way toward making them
c-omiortable until summer work begins. About
$13,000 has already been collected by sub
scription for the work, but fully $15,000 more
is needed for the completion of tne bou\ vard
to the Ingleside road. Subscriptions should
therefore be made liberally and immediately,
as it is necessary to push the work on to com
pletion and not lose the benefit of the work
already provided for.
The boulevard, when completed to Ingle
side. will form the most important public im
provement which has been accomplished in
our City for many years. Connecting with
the park at one end, and at the other with the
Ocean House road and Ocean highway, it
gives opportunity for a splendid drive or bicy
cle tour of about fifteen miles through the
most picturesque part of our City and County.
And the new roadways that will presently fol
low this one, from "the Ineleslde end in a
southerly direction, will give the City what it
has hitherto lacked but greatly neededâ an
agreeable and direct route to the south boun

ALL THEY COULD EAT.
The Ladles of the West Side Chris
tian Church and John Llnd
Provide Lunches.
The work on the boulevard is rapidly
progressing. The men, with but a few
exceptions, seem to be doing good wor&.
A few who were inclined to shirk their
work were discharged 3 r esterday. It had
a good effect on the others and it le not
expected that any more dismissals will
become necessary. The subscription
fund has reached $13,901 90 and it ia hoped
that it will soon reach $15,000. Thai sum
would be just about enough to carry the
work through thoroughly. Next Sunday
will see the roadway ready for driving and
the visitors will be enabled to take a spin
of almost a miie.
Just before 12 o'clock yesterday a com
mittee of ladies from the West Side Chris
tian Church drove up. They had a most
bounteous supply of luncheon, including
several hundied 'sandwiches, boiled eg?*,
cans of potted ham, fisn, beans, etc. Ail
kinds of cakes, fruits and jelly finished up
the list, if oae lone cigar may be ex
cepted.
The "committee consisted of the follow
ing Indies: Mrs. T. Youne, M-s. Clark,
Mrs. Empy and Mrs. McÃirney. Soon
after ths event John Lind drove up with
an express-wagon load of sandwiches, and
so with the soup irom the Aimshouse
the men had more than enough to eat.
Donations keep coming in and in the
nick of time. Yesterday the Judson Man
ufacturing Company sent in a keg of
nail?, Payot, Uphani & Co. sent in a batch
of stationery and the Washburn & Moen
Manuiacturing Comnany donated two
kegs of track nails. From E. K. Denniscn

TO COMMEMORATE HEfiOIO ACTS.
Ladies of the G. A. It. Will Plant Trees
In the Capitol Grounds.
The "memorial erove" committee of
j the Ladies of the G. A. R. has decided to
plant trees in the Capitol grounds at
Sacramento on May next.
The trees have almost all arrived from
the noted battlefield* of tho War of the
Rebellion, and will be placed nearly in a
circle, in the center of which will be
planted two cannons and an anchor from
the old warsliiD Pensacola. These will
j represent the naval battles, as the trees
|do the land combats. This is the first
I prove of the kind ever planted in the
United States. The project is attracting
great attention and commendation, not
only from all old soldiers, but ail patriotic
people in the East as well as here.
It is expected that the ceremonies will
be elaborate, as ail the posts of the G. A.
R., Relief Corps and Sons and Daughters
of Veterans will be invited to participate,
as well as the Governor and other State
officers. The children and grandchildren
of the old soldiers will assist in planting
the trees.
To Eliza H. Waggoner, the chairman of
the committee, is due the credit of the
conception of the idea of planting sucli a
grove and much of the work irÂ» carrying it
to a successful termination, ably aiaed by
the department president, Sister Bell S.
Herr, both of Sacramento city, as well as
by the united assistance and cordial sup
port of the ladies of the whole order in the
entire State..
M. X Frank. Failure.
M. E. Frank, a well-known hypnotist and
haberdasher, assigned to Levi Strauss yester
day for the benefit of creditor*. It is said his
liabilities will r?ech $10,000. The assets *re
said to consist of household goods and $5000
in building and loan stock. Mr. Frank was
not to be seen yesterday. Levi Strauss was
one of his heaviest creditors.

THE CHILD IS
MRS, HOLSTROM'S
Judge Seawell Rendered a
Decision fliat Was
Popular.
Two Women Weeping in Court,
One for Sorrow, Oae
for Joy.
Mrs. D'Arlenay Declared to Be a Gool
Woman, bat Her Daughter Has
Formed Other Ties.
Two agitated women filled Judge Sea
well's courtroom with their sobs yesterday
afternoon. Mrs. Lucinda Holstrora wept
for joy and Mr?. Sarah d'Artenay was Â«o
overpowered with sorrow that only tears
could give partial relief, for the court had
just uttered the words giving to Mrs. Hol
strom the permanent custody of little
Effie V. R. Holstrom.
At the conclusion of the Judge's remarks
there was a burst of applause.showing that
his decision had met a responsive chord
in the hearts of the persons who crowded
the room.
Bailiff Matt Fallon exercised his au
thority to suppress the uproar by shout
ing, "Order in court!" and ti.en hastened
to lend aid to Mrs. d'Artenay, who had
fainted. The unfortunate lady was quickly
removed to the corridor, where the fresh
air restored her consciousness. She at
once went into hysterics and the hallways
rang with her shrieks for several minutes.
In the meantime the joyous Mrs. Hol
strom was speeding from the scene of so
much trouble, bearing in her arms tho lit
tle one over whom tne controversy had
arisen and on whom she had lavished such
a wealth of affection.
In the opinion of the court Mrs. d' Arte
iu.y had not the same love for the little
one that was felt by the foster mother, and
taking into consideration the welfare of
the child, Mrs. Uolstrom's application for
guardianship was granted.
Headers of The Call who have taken an
interest in this case will remember that
little Eftie was born about five years ago
in this city. Her mother was unmarried
at that time and made a written paper by
which she purported to give and bequeath
her baby to Mrs. Lucinda Hoist rum of
Empire City, Or. This was duly wit
nessed, and Mrs. Holstrom made a
formal acceptance in writing of the trust
thus imposed.
The mother of the child subsequently
married Mr. d'Artenay of Dixon, Solano
County, and ho learned of the existence
of the child for the first time in January
of this year. When his wile auked for the
return of the child he joined tier in that
demand, and so the matter was taken into
court. Inasmncn as Mrs. Holstrom had
never taten legal steps for the adoption
of the little one she bad to nppear in court
on an equal footing with Mrs. d'Artenay,
their opposing petitions for guardianship
coming up for consideration simul
taneously.
So great has been the interest mani
fested in this controversy and so many
persons have become involved in it that
tiie courtroom has beon crowded at eyery
hearing.
A silence as of death prevailed as Judge
Seawell ascended the bench to announce
his decision, for when the fate of a human
being, for cood or for bad, for time and
for eternity, is in tne balance there is
something impressive and even awful in
the judicial ceremonies attending the
final decision.
The court said that Attorney Sullivan,
speaking for Mrs. d'Artenay, had objected
to the validity of the so-callert deed of
gift of the child, and he sustained Mr.
Sullivan's contention that it was not
legally binding as an act of abandonment.
It is true a parent cannot legally divest
himself or herself of the duties which the
community requires must be discharged
by parents in regard to ti.eir offspring.
The paper, therefore, would not be con
sidered by the court except to explain tho
attitude of the contending parties touch
ins tneir relationship to the minor child.
The court spoke highly of Mrs. d'Arte
nay and ber modest appeaumcc in court.
He said that no matter wtfat her misfor
tunes may have been, be considered her a
good woman now, and a proper person to
have the custody of ft child. Mrs. Hoi
strom he found to be equally worthy, and
in deciding the case be put them both on
the same equality of excellence and ma
tronly worth. So far an the testimony of
Bert Joy against Mrs. Holstrom was con
cerned, he disregarded that altogether.
He thought Joy a vile creature beneath
the consideration of all human oeings.
From the testimony Judge Seawell said
he found that Mrs. d'Artenay nevor ex
pfcted to pet l.er chila back until she
heard that Mrs. Holstrom wished to give
it up. That was false information, as it
was shown conclusively that Mrs. Hol
strom never had any such intention.
The provision of the code quoted by Mr.
Sullivan, if taken alone, wou.d be conclu
sive in establishing the right of the actual
mother 10 the custody of tne child, but
Mr. Deuprey, representing Mrs. Holstrom.
had made the strong point that the other
provisions of the codes must be rend and
construed in connection with it. He said
that the decisions of the California Su
preme Court are in line with the senti
ment expressed in the American State
Reports, page 182, where It is said : "Ineacii
case due regard will be given to the feel
ings and wishes of the parent, yet the con
trolling consideration is the welfare of the
child."
The Supreme Court of Wisconsin (75
Wis. 51) has added: "'Alter the affections
of both the chiid and adopted parent be
come encase I and a state of things has
nrisen wtuch cannot be altered without
risking tue happine-s of the child, and the
parent seeks to reclaim ii, the better
opinion is that he is nJ in a position to
secure the interference of a court in his
lavor."
Judge Seawell said that the statute of
California leaves open the inquiry as to
the suitableness of the parent for the pur
pose of taking sucu custody, and it seems
quite obvious that if forany cause the
welfare of the mlant demands that its
care and custo ly be withheld irom the
parent and given to another the parent is
not a suitable person to have such care
and custody within the meaning of the
statute.
In view of the circumstances it seemed
to the ecr.rt that it would be better for the
foster mother to have the custody of the
child Etlie, and it was so ordered.
Mrs. Holstrom sprang forward and took
the chiid irom th* arms of its temporary
custodian and quickly left the courtroom,
but she could not keep from crying, and
her tears seemed to kupri>e the little one,
who patted her foster mother's cheek and
prattled loving words in herear while be
ing borne from the City Hall.
Mr. Sullivan asked to have the record
made up in legal form, saying that he in
tended to take an appeal to the Supreme
Court.
OARS ON SIXIH STREET.
An Electric Line to ltun From Geary to
the Mission.
A committee representing the Sixth
street Improvement Club, accompanied
by President Dohrmann and Secretary
Freud of the Merchants' Association,
called upon Manager Vining of tha Mar
ket-street Railway Company yesterday
morning regarding the desired improve
ment of the service upon Sixth street.
The Sixth-street committee consisted of
L. V. Merle, H. Israel, J. Farrell, J. Wolf,
Henry Ell^bach and S. Iloaenthal.
Secretary Willcutt of the Geary-street
Railway Company also attended the con
ference. After consideration of the va
rious possible connections with a Sixth
street electric system, it was finally de
cided that the best plan would be to have
an electric road run along Sixth street
to Market and along Taylor street to
Geary.
At the intersection of Geary and Taylor
streets transfers would be given to connect
wiih the Western Addition.
The committee of the Sixth-street Im
provement Club was fully satisfied with
this plan and decided to call upon Mayor
Phelan to rtquest that the present unused
rails on Taylor street be allowed to re
main for the purpose of carrying out this
proposed elec.ric road that would Connect
Sixth street with the balance of the City
and give a modern street railway equip
ment to that important thoroughfare,

Names of the Lucky Men Who
Have Been Chosen for Duty
in the Offic?.
Influence of Members of the Legisla
ture Has Been Recogniz d b/
the County Clerk-
It was surmised during tne session of
the Legislature that immediately after
the adjournment of that body some
changes would take place in the clerical
force of the County Clerk's office of this
City. C. F. Curry, the County Ciark, en
countered some obstacles at Sacramento,
and in order to protect the public serv.ee
and guard his own interests decided to
recognizs several members in tbe distribu
tion of official patronage.
It has been whispered low in the corri
dors of the City Hall for several days that
quite a number of chances in the office
would take place at tbe expiration of tbe
present month. The County Clerk has
teen subjected to every influence imagin
able to make certain appointments and to
withhold contemplated removals. Tbe
"ins" bring as nuicu pressure to stay as
the "outs" do to get in. It was first
reported twelve clerks would be let out
to-day, but Mr. Curry said to a reporter of
The Call yesterday afternoon that only
four changes would be made at present.
He declined to name the men to be let
out on the ground that it might work to
their detriment by preventing them from
getting instant employment elsewhere.
He said, "I intend to appoint Fred Frey
as deputy and to appoint Holcombe, Kin
caid und Prindt as copyists in the oflica."
When asked if any members of the
Legislature would be appointed Mr. Curry
replied in tbe negative, but observed that
they had strongly recommended the men
whose selection bad been made.
There is sure to be great pulling and
hauling to-day when the changes are an
nounced. Tne friends of the dismissed
will fat .er to remonstrate against the ac
tion of the County Clerk and bring every
pull possible to restore their favorites to 1
place.
It was ascertained at the City Hall last
evening that William Reynolds, who was
appointed for three months, wai the dep
uty to be removed in order ;o open the
way for Frey's appointment. Mr. Key
nolds is spoken of as a capable and
worthy man.
Later County Clerk Curry announced
that he intended putting A. J. Martin in
his office as a deputy.

A gentleman residing in T street, N. W. Washington,
D. C, asserts that he suffered for many years with dyspepsia,,
indigestion and biliousness. He tried every known remedy,
consulted many physicians with the hope of getting cured or
even relief, but nothing seemed to relieve him. After meals
he would feel as if a ball of lead was lodged in .-his, stomach,
tired, and listless, as though life was ; scarcely worth living.
â¢ Finally he was attracted to the ad of
RIPANS TftBULEJ
. and concluded to try them. After taking the first two or three
he.was surprised to find the relief they gave and soon he felt
like a new man. He has never been without Ripans Tabules

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL-
It is easy enoueh for Prince Constantino !
to march to. the Greek frontier, but when j
he gets there his troubles will begin.
As the Emperor of Austria says he sees
siens of peace in Crete it is evident he has
much better spectacles than the rest of
the world.
Don't forget that subscriptions to the
boulevard fund are still in order. There
is much work to be done yet and many
men who need it.
The Greeks misht agree to Salisbury's
plan of a neutral zone between them
selves and the Turks provided it were
drawn somewhere in Asia Minor.
The Washington, beef trust is accused
of trying to raise the article as high as it
was vehen the cow jumped over the moon,
but all the same it may end in the soup.
The Governor has sizned the bill author
izing the establishment of a free market
on the water frdnt, and now let us get the
movement started and well under way for
t tie coming season.
It is comforting to know that Demo
cratic oratory is not ali the smoke which
has been caused by the new tariff bill.
The reopened factories and mills are fur
nishing a great deal of it.
Frozen alcohol is said to be the latest
explosive, and a dozen v.en who were re
cently experimenting with it found that a
small glass half full was sufficient to fur
nish a bust for ali of them.
The Lot Alamitos sugar factory will be
ready to start work in June, and the beets
which are to provide it with material are
growing tinely. California is catching on
to the big industry in cood shape.
People who think that nothing can be
Rained by continuing the agitation for a
speeuy beginning of the work of construct
ing the new Federal building should ask
themselves what, would be gained if we
did not agitate it.
Colon 1 Vassos, who commands the
Greek army in Crete, is one of the best
two-handed fighter^ now before the public.
He hoids off the powers with his diplo
matic left while driving the Turks out of
the island with his right.
As the Socialists of Berlin who did not
join in exalting the memory of William I
at t c recent celebration are said to have
been lying low the in:erence is that those
who did exalt the royal memory must
have been engaged in tall lying.
The woolen schedules have been re
garded as the danger point of the new
tariff, and yet they passed the House with
but two dissenting voices among Repub
licans. Another Democratic prediction
has gone to join the cuckoo songs.
The reports of damage done to fruit by
the frost will probably prove in the end to
be exaggerated. As a general rule Cali
fornia fronts scare more than they hurt,
and taking the years right through we
ruanaye to harvest a good crop, frost or no
frost.
The war against adulterated and coun
terfeit food articles ought to improve the
market for fruit thisvear. When the imi
tations are prevented the dealers in genu
ine articles will have a chance to make a
living, and as a consequence more real
fruit will be preserved.
There is to be no longer a Western Pas
senger Association, for that is against the
Jaw, but there is to be a Bnreau of Passen
ger Statistics, and the officials of the asso
ciation are to preside over it. How great
is the difference the law can see 'twixt
tweedledum and tweedledee!
It is s>aid tiiat J. Pierpont Morgan is
backing Daniel Lamont for the presidency
of the Northern Pacific rosd, and perhaps
other members of the Cleveland Cabinet
will get equally pood positions. Mr. Mor
gan, it â¢-eems, is a man who always helps
his friends ahd pay 3 b's debts.
The statement of Secretary Curzon that
England is not siding with the Turks in
Crete was greeted in Parliament with the
cry of "Tommy Rot," and while that was
not exactly an expression of Attic wit it
wa- decidedly one which suited the occa
sion, the place and the subject.
The McKinley administration finds
favor at Washington because all the
members of it are accessible to the people
at all times. There is none of the red
tape or exclusiveness of the Cleveland
regime, but on the other hand a govern
ment which is American in modes and
manners as well as in name.
Senator Morgan's objection to any act
of Congress which wiil separate the Cen
tral Pacific and Union Pacific roads into
two competitive lines is well taken.
I; was tlie original intention of Congress
that the roads should form a great trans
continental route to connect the East with
the Pacific Coast, and that intention
should now be carried out.
At the request of Democratic Congress
men from Georgia and Al bama a protec
tive duty was voted by the Republicans
of Concresb on bauxite or aluminum clay,
and thus another evidence is given that
the new tariff is not a sectional bill nor a
psrty bill, but is designed for the benefit
of all American industries ihat need pro
tection from European competition.
BRITAIN SORROW FOR Us
The wail of the British journals over the
prosDect of a Reuuolicau tariff has
reached this side oi the water on time.
It is a very unanimous wail. ThÂ« gist cf
it is to the effect that Mr. Dineley's bill
will "deplete American revenues, dimin
ish the American cold reserve and impov
eri>h the American people." If there were
any other deplorable thinp susceptible of
forthright, precipitation by a change fn
the tariff we should doubtless incur that
also; but at the "impoverishment" of us
the Britisher pauses to catcli his breath
and rest his ingenuity.
Our gratitude to Britain for this deep
concern for our welfare is too keen for
words. Any attempt on our part to
express It might fail to be properly under
stood. We remember, with feeling, bow
our English cousins rejoice;! with us over
the passing of tho Wilson bill, whose
blessings neaily overcame us in the
months that followed. We recall with
pride the banquet which was tendered, to
Mr. Wilson in London for his patriotism
in writing a bill so favorable to the good
neighbors of bis country. That was a
well-timed recognition of a service well
performed, ami we appreciate it even to
this day in the same warm spirit in which
we appreciate the present solicitude of
our English friends for our attention to
their interests.
But we entreat England to not dwell
upon our misfortunes. She has enough
troubles of her own, and it will not em
bitter us in the least if she will just be
sensible and practical enough to throw off
dull caro and protit by our losses. What
we lose, of course, England will gain, and
since our loss is pronounced i evitable
anyhow we shall not be ungenerous
enough to complain of the one wflo gains
by it.
The Dingley tariff measure is one of the
things which we must accept despite the
deplorable consequences foreshadowed by
the British press, for we voted for it in
our blindness at the last election. So let
England wasie no mofe sympathy upon
us. Instead her people had better begin
preparations to receive all the blessings
which are to fall from us upon them, and
when they have by dint of patient waiting
and diligent search gathered up a thim
bleful they may then ring the bell.
AN AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION.
It is not altogether a comfortable reflec
tion that President McKinley's easy ac
cessibility to callers is deemed sufficiently
extraordinary as an American Presiden
tial trait to be made the subject of a
special dispatch to the newspapers. Yet
such is the fact. In yesterday's tele
graphic news from "Washington the de
mocracy of the present administration
was dwelt upon admiringly to the extent
of nearly a column.
It i? gravely noted that Mr. McKinley
takes strolls along the streets and goes
horseback-riding as unpretentiously as
might any American citizen; also, that
he may be reached in his private office
without the unwinding of needless bright
colored tape. The amazed chronicler
goes on to aver (and presumably he him
self has witnessed it) that several of the
Cabinet officers have been known to walk
into their assistants' offices on business
instead of having a messenger summon
the assistants to their own sanctums. In
other words, they have actually carried
instructions to their subordinates instead
of having their subordinates come to them
to receive the orders. Secretary of Agri
culture Wilson pilots his callers through
the Government conservatories and
points out to them personally the nature
of the various works on whica he is en
gaged. Even Secretary Sherman, who
ueed to be an inaccessible Senator, has
me lowed into a free-to-all officer of the
Cabinet, and tha improvement noted in
him by virtue of that evolution has
evoked prayer from the lips of a thankful
constituency.
Yet, as we have slid, this ought not to
be so rare as to make a single display of it
tne subject of National rejoicing. Presi
dent Cleveland's regime must indeed have
been an exceedingly Btiff-necked and un-
American one to nave Daved the way for
surp.-isn at President McKiniey's Ameri
can deportment. How many more car
dinal sins are to rest upon this retired
Presidential failure? It seems that tie
has even repudiated the very commonest
meaning of democracy, whereof the party
title by which he chooses to designate
himself is a ludicrous misnomer. Democ
racy forsooth! Why, the preceding ad
ministration wasn't even generally demo
cratic, to say nothing of its being the
exalted consummation which it claimed
for itself under a Democratic caption.
A President who cannot be approached
as man to man by a citizen of bis country
is presumably of the opinion that he is
superior to his civilian visitor, and a
President who opines that unique thing is
not where be ougf.t to be when be sits in
a Presidential chair. He oucht to be on
the other side of thÂ» Atlantic.
THEY AEE AT WAR.
To say that war in Europe is inevitable
is to put it mildly. Even if the pompous
struttings of the "powers" up and down
beneath the windows of Greece were not
sufficiently serious evidence of piesent
war the actions of the Greek army wouM
leave nothing to be desired. King George's
soldiers are going to tight to the bitter end
whether he himself says yes or no. If the
latter, nowever, they will let the Turks
alone long enough to proceed back to
Athens and remove him from the throne.
His only alternative is to fight or cease to
be Kir.gr of Greece.
It would indeed be difficult to Include
Europe's immediate chances for war
among the mere probabilities, in the face
of this positive demonstration. War is
not only inevitable â it is there in the
shape of a great army of determined
Greeks ready to fire on the first Turk or
ally of the Turks who gives them a chance.
Those stern gentlemen are not out on a
constitutional exercise this time. They
mean business. The "powers" anticipated
nothing of the kind when they took it
upon themselves to meddle in the nffair.
In fact, i he '"powers" are not used to
"war" of this variety.
The Austrian Kmperor is an optimist of
surpassing sublimity. He seranhically
discerns "prospects for Deace" rainbowing
the southern horizon of his domains.
"Thanks to the common action of the
powers," gurgles this fatuous old man,
"the dangers arising from Greece's action
in Crete have been minimized. * * * I
say this above all in regard to the Cretan
question, upon which my Government is
in accjrd with the powers who have taken
measures to preserve the territorial status
quo and suppress the tendencies and as
pirations menacing to peace.''
Anything to preserve peace is the bur
den of his hope. We are to assume that
if he were to behold a fl .grant act of
vandalism going on upon his frontier, lie
would hold his soldiers back from the
offenders in the interest of that same
divine peace.
But peace there will never be in Europe
until .he Greeks have redressed the
wrones of Christianity in Crete, or have
died in the attempt. And there are not

enouch Turks to kill them. If they die
at all it will be at the bands of the brave
"powers," whose slaughter of them will
go to form another bloody leaf in the his
tory of "civilization's" tyrannical out
rages. When civilization constitutes
itself an international policeman, it al
ways clubs the small boy and lets the
robust offender alone.
A FKEE MARKET.
Governor Budd has signed Senate bill
507, authorizing the state .Board of Har
bor Commissioners to establish and main
tain a free public market upon the water
front of San Francisco.
It is somewhat surprising that San
Francisco has nut had a free market long
ere this. It certainly bus not been be
cause her citizens have failed to compre
hend the advantages of snch an institu
tion, for just across the bay in the city of
Oakland there is one which keeps every
Wednesday and every Saturday green in
the memory of the wnole purchasing com
munity. And not a few San Franciscans
have proviaently learned the eventful
dates by heart, to the end of happening
over there with a market-basket on their
arm when the "frost isn't on the pump-
Kin and tiie fodder isn't in the shock."
A free market is not in the least a com
plicated institution, nor one requiring
many details in its establishment. To use
a colloquialism now in vogue, "any old
thing will do." A long shed provided with
partition?, at more or less regular inter
vals, the which to be used ns stalls, is the
common pattern. The place Itself is not
of so much importance as is the grant of
freedom to sell the produce without a
license. Fruits, . getables, meats, any
thing of an edible nature, are here per
mitted to be sold by whoever happens to
have them for sale and desires to profit by
the privilege.
Usually "iree-market days" are set apart
as semi-weekly occasions of uncommon
commercial importunce, and the spectacle
affoided by the carelessly loaded stalls
suirounded by swarms of marketers who
care more for the freshness and cheapness
of the commodities than for the con
ventionalities of modern "shopping" is
always interesting as a sign of the times.
Of course there are hundreds of house
wires who would not tramp around to free
markets, or have their servants do so, if
there w*re one on every street corner.
They prefer to deal in the conventional
way and pay for the comfort which they
save to themselves thereby. And there
are always plenty of established stores to
furnish them with first-class staples. It is
to the individual producer, therefore, that
the principal advantage of a free market
accrues, after all is said.
A VILLAINOUS SCHEME.
The patriots to charge of the Union
Pacific Railroad propose to sell the same
to the operators of a line of road extend
ine from its eastern terminus on to New
York and Pennsylvania, thus enabling
the purchasers to control a complete line
of transportation from the Atlantic to
the Pacific.
A bill favoring this ingenious measure
has been reported to the Senate, and
Senator Morgan, who knows a thing or
two about Pacific railroads, has vigorously
denounced it. ''Legislation." said he,
day before yesterday, "that separates the
Central Pacific and the Union Pacific
roads in two competitive parts destroys
the greatest value and denies to the people
the real advantages of the great trans
continental highways created for their
benefit and built with their money nncier
the laws that this bill seeks to abolish."
Senator Morgan is unquestionably right.
The very purpose in loaning money to
promote the construction of the Union
Pacific was to open up, in connection with
the Central Pacific, a National highway
across the continent, as the Senator says,
"lor Government purposes, every mile of
which should be perpetually dependent
upon every other mile for its commercial
value," and for the permanency of the
whole system. Yet liere we find the tem
porary holders of the roadsâ permitted to
remain so only by the sufferance of the
United States Government â impudently
engaging to sell half of the system to
another railroad corporation 1
Mr. Morgan is unable to perceive how
there can be any sale of the Union Pacific
until the statutes disclose eoiue indication
that authority exists for such a transaction.
And if the statute should be so construed
as to make it appear that the authority
does exist, he declares that it should
forthwith be annulled by Congress.
Nothing should interfere with the Gov
ernment's original calculations. The
United States mig.it as well think of re
linquishing this great highway as an in
strumentality of government as the
British might think of selling the Cana
dian Pacific, "the spinal column of the
empire" in a military sense, to the Ameri
can army.

Interest.
A Weekly Half-Holiday.
Editor Call: Sirâ ls it not time that ihe question of a weekly half-holiday was taken up in
this western outpost of civilization? Our City has a reputation to maintain for keeping up
with the times; and it is not to our credit that we can be pointed at as Icing behind our
Eastern and old-world contemporaries in the treatment our employers accord to their â¢â¢help.''
Yet to a New Zealand friend who recently arrived on this coast, mis aspect of San Francisco
was a disagreeable awakening to a situntion of things he had never considered possible in
"Free America." Of course, his own country, from a labor point of view, maybe regarded a s
among the first and most enlightened; but it will surely not satisfy Western lolk to be among
the laggards in a matter of common and reasonable humanityâ the institution of a half-day's
relief per week for our wage-workers of all kinds.
If business were conducted here on easy-going lines, with frequent festivals, as in Roman
Catholic countries, the subject would have no urgency; but in San Francisco, we are fully as
brisk and high-strung as our Eastern business brethren, and require an occasional and regular
stop for repairs as much as they do. Sunday, by convention or habit (while bringing a
welcome rest) is to most of us an unnaturally and unbuoyantly spent day; while even those
who enjoy and improve themselves by religious exercises, of course miss the opportunities for
physical recreation which a weekly holiday would give to them. I think the clergy, for more
reasons than one, might well support the cause of a week-day rest, and trust you may be able
to evoke some opinions on this point from some of tnem.
Fresh air and exercise are as necessary as food and clothing for us all, yet but few city
toilers can compass ihc former in the hurry and stress of the daily routine life. A new zest to
th c hardest work is given by the holiday, which tends to reconcile more easily the healihy
youth of both sexes to the unnatural confinement and tedium of office and store, and thereby
aids in the efficiency of the services rendered. The worker, conscious that some consldi-raiion
lsfeUinr him by the communiiy, through his employer, manes a better and more loyal citi
zen. With ihis definite breathing spell to look forward and buck to, when the cycle rule, the
game or the ramble can be enjoyed, what clerk or salesman is not the brighter, the steadier,
and consequently the more useful and profitable employe.
Statistics have been publisned in England showing the results of some years' labor experi
ments on this line in some largo fuctories of that country. They show conclusively that un
reasonably long hours of consecutive work are, less productive "to the mill-owner, ooth as to
quality nnd quantity, than conditions, including shorter hours, more favorable to the health
and comfort of the factory hands. And this is a self-evident proposliion to the thoughtful and
humane mind that knows anything o! the rudimentary needs and functions of our human life.
It is the first step that eos:s ; and doubt. ess when one Important business house t:as lnau
rated the half-holiduy others wou.d soon fall in line. Which of the many claimants to be
â¢'leading houses" will once for all prove its right to the title and be gratefully hfinded down
in local history as the pioneer of this reform V Is tnls not an honor pnd an ambition worth
even the slight risk 01 temporary loss ? But it is unlikely San Franciscans would let any house
or firm suffer by granting this boon (1 should like to say right) to its employes.
Whe;Â» the above arguments in iavor of this ticw expansion of the social conscience and
interest are fully considered, and when it is considered what the granting of this boon would
mean in adding happiness to thousands of homes and health and cheerfulness 10 tens of
thousands of toilers, we shall wonder, if we do not wonder now, how we could have got along
all this time without it WILLIAM MITCHELL.

FOR THE PURE
FOOD CONGRESS
An Address to the Editors
; of the Entire
1 State.
' Many Prominent Organizations
. and People Are Invited
[ to Attend.
Â»
i
i The Bg Gathering May Be Followed
by a Mass-Meeting in Metro*
'....' politan Temple. .
___________
i Active preparations are being made for
the Pure Food Congress that is to be held
, in the Chamber of Commerce on April 30.
Present indications are that it will be a
very pretentious affair and that large
numbers from all over the State will at
tend.
The executive committee of the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association and
committees of the congress met yesterday.
At the meeting were F. A. Brown, J. A.
Filcher, I. Jacobs, M. J. Keller, B. N.
Rowley and J. W. Kerr. Rowley of the
subjects' and speakers' committee re
ported that ha had secured the services of
many prominent and eloquent speakers
who will address the congress.
Mr. Filcber of the publication commit
tee presented the following which was
adopted and which will be sent to ail of
the editors of newspapers in the State:
For more than a year the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association of San Francisco
has energetically agitated the ques tlon of pure
I food and tbe importance of enforcing the laws
I against food adulteration. The present San
Francisco Board of Health has taken up the
subject vigorously and has entered upon a
crusade against the adulterators of - food
products and dealers in adulterated article".
An investigation of trie extent to which adul
terated foods are thrown on the market of Cal
ifornia from the East and elsewhere is calcu
lated to surprise one not familiar with the
subject, and when we reflect that we are a
great producer of food products and that the
market for these goods depends very largely
on the reputation which we shall maintain for
purity and excellence in the character of our
output, the importance of a movement that
wlh root ou; every adulterated article and
punish every adulterator of our food produc
tion must be apparent to every well-wisher of
California. .
It has been found that the campaign against
this class of offenders, which is being vigor
ously prosecuted in San Francisco, is having
the result of driving the rejected goods back
into the interior, and hence those who are
leading in this agitation have come to the con
clusion that the only way 10 meet the evil ef
fectually Is to make the movement as broad as
the State. Wiih this view it is hoped to inter
est all the people of California and especially
the leading spirits in each community of the
j State. As a preliminary to this end the Manu
â¢ facturers' and Producers' Association, in con
| junction with a committee of the Council of
; Associated Industries (the latter body being
composed of representatives from eleven oi the
leading industrial and commercial organiza
tions of San Francisco), have resolved in favor
of holding a State pure food congress in San
Francisco on the 30th of April, 1897. â  â¢â :..â â¢
It has been determined to secure representa
i tives to said congress by asking the Governor
of the State to appoint fifty deesates at large,
by asking the Supervisors of â  each county to
appoint at least ten delegates from each of the
respective counties, by asking the Mayors of
incorporated cities to appoint delegates in
: proportion to their population, and by asking
I Boards ;of " Trade, Chambers â¢of Commerce,
granges and other Industrial organizations all
I over California to send delegates. This circu
lar is sent to the press of the S.ate that it may
know the scope, character and purpose of this
Important move, ana with, the nope of enlist
ing its energetic co-operation, we ask the
I editor to whom this is sent to take up the sub
| ject in his editorials and make it one of local
' importance, for inasmuch as his locality i* a
: part of California he and his constituents are
i interested. See to it that your Supervisors ap
] point the allotted number of representatives
to the proposed pure-food congress. Sec to it
that your incorporated cities are represented.
See to it that your .local Boards of Trade and
other organizations send delegates. Come
yourself. Participate in this great move for
the emancipation of California from one of toe
. greatest curses that is now clogging its prog
ress, damaging its reputation and endanger
â  ing the healtn of its citizens.
We would like to sco each editor in Califor
nia make this movement his movement ana
give it that hearty backing which will carry
it through to success, and cause the glad
acclaim to go ringing throughout the civilized
world that California has stamped out the last
trace of adulterated food and manfully main
tained its reputation as the greatest pure food
producer on earth, until all shall* come to
know and accept the word , "California" on a
package of food i products as an evidence not
only of its excellence, but of its absolute
purity. It is the ambition of the projectors of
j thin move to make this convention ' the event
i of the year, an epoch in the history of the
State. We want to make it the greatest con
vention ever held in California. We want to
se it so large in numbers, so positive and prac
tical in action as to startle those who for a
] present personal advantage would blast the
I name and fame of the State, and serve as a
I notice to them now and forever that they can
-1 not ply their vocation with safely to their
i peace and profit to their purse within the con
! fine- of California. Very respectfully, . -/â

Committee.
Isidor Jacobs of tbe invitation commit
tee stated be bad sent invitations to at
tend the congress to Governor Budd, com
mercial and industrial organizations of
the City and State, Supervisors of the
State and City, Mayors of all the large
cities in the State, State granges, boards
of health (city and State), education smi
horticulture. In all probability a man
meeting in Metropolitan Temple will
follow the congress, to wijicb. the public
will be invited.

An Oklahoma lumber-dealer, holding a bill
against a church in the town of S.ilUvater,
attached the property and put it into the
hands of a receiver. The latter rented it the
following Sunday to a theatrical company,
who met the approaching congregation with a
demand for tickets of admission. Aghast at
this brazen sacrilege, the congregation retired
in an orderly procession and entered upon a
casual search for the lumber-dealer, who, how
ever, had casually strolled out of sight just a
few moments, in advance of their visit. And
now the church 1 folk, in thelprivrcy of their
homes, ' v are doubtless asking tttemse/res it

AMONG THE CRAFT
Three Collisions Occurred
on the Bay Yasterday
Morning
There Was Not a Great Amount
oi Damage Done in Any
Instance.
The C os Bay Damaged tha Mary
Garratt and the Equator Ran
Into the Alert.
Collisions were the order of the day on
the water front Monday night and yester
day. The Ruby A. Cou-ms ran in;o
Folsorn-slreet wharf on Monday after
noon, the Coos Bay into tne Mary Gar
ratt, tbx- Equator had a tussle with the
Alert and the captain of the Balasora as
serts that the Ida Wand her tow damaged
the rudder and rudder-poit of his vessel.
What with the Columbia striking the Dar
when passing out. from Astoria and other
Accidents which have heen reported dur
ing the last few days, the recent storm has
been the most disastrous that has struck:
the coast ior a long time.
After striking, the Columbia put back
for an examination and, in consequence,
she will be a day late in reaching San
Francisco.
The Coos Bay and Mary Garratt had
quite a time of it. The river steamer was
at eection 2 of the seawall discharging
wheat and the Coos Bay was attempting
to make a landing. She also was Heavily
laden with wheat and would not answer
! her helm. A'ongside the wharf it was
) flood and 200 yards out it was ebb tide.
! The Coos Bay's stern was caujebt in the
rip, and belore anyihing could be done
she crashed into the Mary Garratt. The
stern-v/tiee er was damaged to the extent
of about $500, w.-ile about $L'sO will pat
the Coos Bay in as eood condition as ever.
The new steam schooner Equator made
her first record by running into the
Spreckel-.' tug Alert. The former lost her
head gear, but the Alert was only slightly
damaged and was ready for sea again half
an hour later. Captain Larzzervicn of the
Equator has resigned, and his place will
be taken by a new master who will com
mand the little vessel when she goes to
Alaska as a tender for the Alaska Packers'
Association's fleet. Tt.e Equator was for
| merly a small tchooner, but latter;y she
I has bad engines rut in her, and a we<-k
ago blossomed out into a full-fledged steam
schooner.
The smart and hand-ome tug Ida W
was also in trouble. Captain James had
a barge in tow and was making his way
I along the front. When off Union-street
| wharf the tow toot a sheer and came
! close to the stern of ti<e Balasora. The
! master of the latter asserts that the barge
i struck his stern and damaged the rudder,
j while Cap am James is equally positive
1 that his tow did not come w.thin ten feet
!of the snip. In any event a divc-r is to be
I sent down, an i the damage, if any, to
I the Balasora will be ascertained.
Jack Hayes had two experiences yester
day that he will not forget in a hurry.
Four "water-front bums" had made a
house for themselves out of a number of
empty beer cask< that were awaiting an
owner. They had a gimlet, a tin can and
a small glass, and were systematically
draining the kegs when caueht. Sergeant
Hayes ordered them out and they obeyed,
but as soon a* they reached the sidewa.K
they showed ri^ht. The officer of the law
used his cane, btv the men would have got
away had not Officer Con Donohue pot in
an appearance. Chief Wharfinger Root
and Assistant Chief Wharfinger Harry
Scott and Dave Craemer also came up on
the run, and the four "bums" were booked
at the Harbor Police station on a charge
of vagrancy.
Half an hour later Sergeant Hayes again
visited the same reson and again found
it tenanted. On this occasion, however,
he withdrew, and is still minus v quarter.
The occupants were an old woman and a
young man. They were ruotner and son.
Tne son was clad in bil coat, shirt and
vest and :he mother was doing her best
to darn up the holes in his tattered pant".
John Kerr is the name of tne young fel
low and he is siowly dying of consumD
tion. For months he has worked along
the front eking out an existence at load
ing express-wagons and doing odd jobs.
La;e and early he is at wont, and it was
only when his old mother saw him on the
wharf yesterday doing nothing that she
had a chance to mend his torn and tattered
trousers. Such is life.
The cannery and fishing fleet are ail
fitting out lor the northern cruise. This
thing has occurred year after year for a
generation, but for the first time in the
history of fishing and bunting twenty
Johnsons out o: a crew of thirty went put
on the Invincible bound for the canneries.
\Yben he heard the news Lorentz Foard
asked, "Where were the Smiths?"
The battle-ship Oregon went out yester
day, and the next time she is heard from
she will be in Puget Sound. The Petrel
would not tempt the bar, but when the
gale is over she will go to Honolulu to
relieve the Alert.
The Harbor Commissioners held a short
â ession ys:erday and discussed the estab
lishment of a new fruit market on the
front. There is no doubt but what the
nffair can be arranged, as all the Commis
sioners are in favor of the project. Tne
chances are that the space between Fisr>
ermrn's wharf and Lombard street will be
utilised, and both a rish and fruit market
established on tha 100'J feet of available
water front.
Tne following forecast and notice to
mariners has b-en issued by the Branch
Hyirographic Office in regard to the North
Pacific:
The northeast trade wind belt will be found
silently widened, with the southern limit re
maining about tiie same, while the northern
iimii will be fonnd a little farther north than
during March.
Along th^ south side of that section of the
ocean east of the Hawaiian Islands the trade
winds wih oe tound blowing witu a decidedly
northerly s:ant, while to the westward they
will be more easterly and frequently esst-
Koutheasieriy. Near the coist, within tne
northea>t trade wind limit.'*, northerly and
northwesterly winds may be exptcted Instead
of northeasterly winds.
Occasional fog will be found along the coast
of the United S;atts, but not sufficient to war
rant its probable limits being shown on the
pilot chart.
Just south of the gulf of Alaska will be found
strong westerly and southwesterly winds. In
the zone between 35 and 50 nortn latitude
frequent westerly gales end fog may be ex
pected accompanied by rain, with occasional
i.vi. and snow.
On the southeast coast of Asia the northeast
monsoon will decrease in force and constancy.

WHO WILL BE
KOREAN MINISTER?
Rev, Dr. Jones of Seoul on
the Interest in the Mat
ter in East Asia.
The Flight of the King and
Restoration of the O.d
0 fice- Holders.
Gocd Work of Clarence Greathous 1
in Completely Changing the Pro
cess of Court Trials-
The Rev. George Heber Jones, a mis
sionary of the Methodist Episcopal
church for nine years past in Korea, and
editor of the Korean Repository, is among
the arrivals at the Occidental. He says
there is considerable interest among the
missionaries and others in recard to who
will be appointed by President McKin
ley as Minister to Korea. The present
Minister is John M. B. Sill of Michigan,
who was sent out to Seoul by Cleveland.
The post at Seoul pays $7500 a year, and
THE REV. GEORGE HEBER JONES, the Editor and Mis
sionary of Seoul, Korea.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
ordinarily there would be a lot of scram
bling for it. Still the statesman wao goes
to Korea must make up his mind that for
the first three or four years that he is
abroad he cannot keep in with his people
at home, politically speaking, and he may
get sidetracked. No man who has a good
paying law practice, or a business man of
large affairs, can afford to take it. Still
the expenses of entenaining are light.
There are no curioa to buy, because the
Koreans are not artistic, and a man if he
has an eye to the main c'aance can stow
away quite a pretty penny.
"Ther* is a great deal of interest in the
matter of the appointment," said Mr.
Jones. "We all hope he will be a capable
man and a credit to the country. Mr.
Greathousc, who used to edit one of tho
dailies here, hns made for himself a great
reputation in Korea.
"I am well acquainted with Mr. Great
house. He holds the post of legal ad
viser to the King, and has been instru
mental in introducing some much-reeded
and very beneficial reforms in the mode
of criminal procedure in the Korean
courts. In the recent trials of certain of
ficials attainted of high treason General
GreathcuÂ«e took a prominent part, and,
as a result, the corruption, Injustice and
cruelty which marked the usual course of
procedure in former days was abandoned,
and everything conducted in a manner
conducive to strict justice.
"Having left Korea some time ago, I
hardly feel competent to speak concerning
the present state of affairs there. What
has come to me in correspondence has not
been of an alarming character. I never
regarded the flight of his Majesty to the
Russian legation as having the Bensa
tional signilicance which there has been
a tendency to attach to it. There was no
place in all Korea where the King wo? so
utterly at the mercy of the warring fac
tions as in his own palace. His personal
body-guard had been reduced to a dis
heartened, insufficient contingent of men,
his privacy utterly destroyed and his
position rendered "unendurable. Had it
not been for the faithfulness of such
friends as General Dye some such step
as tho flight might have been necessary
soon after the murder of the Queen.
At the time of the King's flight
I doubt very much if there was
any lesation that was in a po
sition to receive and entertain him ex
cept the Ru-sian, though on this point I
am not informed. However, the hegira
and residence in the Russian legation are
now a thing of the past, for the tele
graphic dispatches inform lis that the
King has returned to hia palace. This
palace is a new one, which his Majesty
has erected in that part of feeoul occupied
by the foreigners, and the palace grounds
adjoin those of tho English and American
legation?.
'â¢I doubt if Korea will be appropriated
by any one of the jrreat powers. I think
it is a recognized fact that tbe Koreans
are capable of self-govern merit if the dis
union and internecine strife of the i;rrat
clans can only be healed. 80 far Korea
has in a remarkable manner escaped ab
sorption into the great empires adjacent.
Every dynasty for the last 1300 years that
has occupied the dragon tnrone of China
has sent its troops down into the penin
sula to plunder and rob, but they have
never succeeded in nbsorbine tbe country
and people; Japan also under the Taiko
300 years ago did the business once and for
ail in such a thorough manner that tbe
country still bears the 3car.% but Korea
still remained a sovereign government.
There is every reason to believe tbe same
good fortune will attend ber now. Korea
hns been fortunate !n the character of the
European-* whom she has employed. Men
of talent, had they not been hampered by
the folly and inertia of the officials, they
might have long ago done much for the
country.
"At the pre-ent time the direction of
the national finances is under the control
of Dr. MacLeavy Brown, an Englishman,
who is putting an effectual atop to the
useless expenditure, peculation and pilfer
ine of the 'good old times. 1 The na
tional income, I believe, is approximately
$3,000,000 (gold), and with care and
economy a yearly surplus can be shown,
while tnis income will increase with the
development of the resources of the coun-
try.
'â¢The old conservative faction is coming
gradually into power, but their sojonrn in
the 'bushes' for three years has not
been without its benefit, and they ssem to
be animated with better ideas than in the
past."
The Korean Repository, which the Rev.
Mr. Jones founded, and edits in connec
tion with hiÂ« mission work, is the only
paper in the English language in Korea.
INDIGNANT AT DOCKERY.
A Milkman Who Says He Has
Been Done a Great
Injustice.
Posted as Evading the Inspection
Stations When in. Reality It
Was a Misunderstanding-
John Tamony, a milkman who sells hie
lacteal wares in this City, is indignant at
Chief Milk Inspector Dockery and has de
manded an investigation at the hands of
the Board of Health of the matter of
which he complains.
He says that he was posted as one of
those who had refused to send his milk to
the inspection stations, when as a matter
of fact there was no one on hand to test
the miik when it was ready.
He states that the matter was explained
to Dockery and that the heilth official
seemed satisfied, but has ignored his
claims to a vindication.
Mr. Tamonv has consulted an attorney
ana sent the following communication to
the Board of Health:
To trie Honorable the Board of Heath of the
City and < ounty of San Francisco â Gentlemkn:
Ou the '23d day oi March, 1897, an article ap
peared in the morning papers of the City pur
porting to be in substance the con
tents of a circular issued from the
Board of Health warning the public against
dealing with certain dairymen of this City.
and charging that they persistently refused to
submit the milk soid by them to the Heal th
Inspector for inspection. Among those named
wan John Tamony, me undersigned.
Being absent from the City on my ranch in
Sonoma County I was unable to call upon Mr.
Dockery, the milk inspector, for a correction
of me charge, in 10 far as it related to me,
until March 25, wben I learned from h.'m that
my drivers did not submit my milk, tor inspec
tion ai station 3, Alabama street, on the after
noon of March 13. I then explained to him
that on that day the milk was inspected at the
station on the morning of t:iai day, and that
my drivers then informed the milk inspector
that it would not be inspected at the station
any more, as my cows would be shipped to my
ranch in Sonoma County that aiternoon, and
that in the future the mi k would be inspected
at the ferry. That the cows were milked at
the lerry wharf that afternoon before ship
ment, and there being no one there to inspect
the milk, no blame could be attached to my
self or anvors.
The explanation seemed!s4tisfnctory to Mr.
Dockery, but he has failed and refused to
in â¢â  k â¢ any correction of the charge acalnsi me.
Now it may be a matter of entire indiffer
ence to the Board of Health or its emp.oyes
how much injury a dairyman may suffer by
such a charge, but to me, who has to depend
on the good will of my patrons for my success
in business, it is quite v different matter.
Therelore I demand of your honorable board
an investigation of tlie charges against me
and a rotractlon of the same. X upon the in
vestigation 1 cannot prove that for the twelve
years I hnve been in business I always sup
plied ray customers with pure milk, then yonr
board can name me as one oi the parlies who
deserve to be watched. Respectfully yours,
John Tamony,
Corner Edinburgh street and India avenue.

CHARGED WITH BURGLARY.
Jackson McCulluin, an Ex-Convict,
Again in tin- Toils.
Jackson McCultam, an ex-convict, was
booked at the City Prison yesterday by
Detectives Egan and Silvey oxl a charge of
burglary.
He served a term for burglary, and was
released on February 11. On March 24 he
entered the room of a servant in the base
ment of the Colonial Hotel, Pine and
Jones streets, and stole a Jady'a gold
watch.
He went to Oakland and was trying
to dispose of the watch when Detective
Holland arrested him and notified the
police here. McCullum made an excuse
that he bought the watch from a friend
on March 23, but it was identified by the
owner.

BALDWIN SAID HE
HAD NO MONEY
' â  -
Why Suit Was Begun
Against Him in the
Justice Court.
Refused to Pay for His Wife's
/"Swell Horse Show
Outfit
Mrs- Baiawin Pat Her OK on the
Bill, bat the Money D d Not
Materialize. â¢ â¢
Â»_ M _^â â _
That lovely gown that Mrs. E. J. Bald
win wore at the horse show has got her
millionaire, husband into a peck of
trouble, and now the Justice court will
have to decide whether the garment was
worth $107 25, and also as to Baldwin's
liability to pay for it.
Mrs. Baldwin wanted a dress that
would become her husband's financial
standing, and also his. position in the
world of horseflesh, and she applied to
Maria Switzer to supply the deficiency.
The dress was to be a dream of lace and
ruffles, made in the height of New Yoru
horse-show fashion, and price was no
object. ''kt-^'f
According to the complaint filed in tne
Justice court yesterday Modiste Switzer
labored long and faithfully on that gown
! and Mrs. Baldwin went into ecstacies
wnen she tried it on for the last time. So
pleased was she that she put the mark of
her approval on the bill when it was pre
sented to her and said:
"Just present this to my husband and
he will pay it at once."
Mrs. Baiawin created a sensation at the
show with that dress, and "Lucky" was
justly proud of her.
Now the modiste is wondering what "at
once" means in the E. J. Baldwin vo
cabulary.
bbe sent the bill to the millionaire repeat
edly, but no attention was paid to it, and
then she tried to see him i>ersonally, but
no one about the hotel seemed to know
his whereabouts when the stylishly
dressed dressmaker called.
In despair she put the matter in the
hands of D. Â£. Besecker, who makes a
business of collecting bills that no one
ei-e can collect, and he hunted up the
Norseman and hotel-owner and gently re
marked that the modiste bad been wait
ing a long time for her money and ou-ht
to be paid. Baldwin looked at the bill for
a moment, examined his wife's O X
cU.-s .y, and then in a sorrowiul voice
sai>i :
"I am sorry, my man, that I can't pay
this, but I can't, and that's all there's to
it. I have no money with which to pay."
Then the collector sued, and says that
he will go to the length of an order of ex
amination to ascertain whether or not
Baldwin is as poor as be claims to be.
Another suit wa3 filed against Baldwin
for feed furnished his hones while racing
in Kentucky.
WILL CHANGE HANDS.
The Old Golden Rale Will Soon Pass
. Under a New. Man
agement.
Negotiations are about to be completed
by which the old-established business of
the Golden Rule Bazaar will change
hands. As previously announced in The
Call, the fiim of Davis Brothers was dis
solved January lof this year. The busi
ness and merchandise effects will soon
pass into the hands of a new company, to
be known as the Golden Rule Bazaar.
The principal stockholders are: Andrew
M. Davis, formerly of Davis Bros. ; M. H.
Hecht, of Hecht Bros. & Co. Albert
Dernham, of Buckingham & Hecht, and
Henry pernham and William Kaufmann,

the business ; that the object of the new
company is to materially enlarge the
plant and place the Golden Rule Bazaar
foremost in the ranks of department
houses of the West. The company will

THE INSURANCE
WAR IS OVER
The Old Compact of Two
Years Ago Has Been
Re-Established.
It May Not Be Permanent, but
the Projectors Have Strong
Hopes.
Enife-Wielders Given a Week by the
Ex^cutivi Committee in Wliich
10 Settle Up Business.
The milk-white fl'.g of peace once more
floats over California street. The oruel
insurance war is over.
It may be only a temporary truce, after
all, for there have been similar cessations
of hostilities before, only to be followed
by another resort to tiie knife. But, never
theless, the insurance men feel that it is
at least a breathinp space, and they have
hopes that the peace may develop into a
permanency.
The action which has resulted in the
new state of affairs and the temporary re
establishment of the old compact rates of
two years ago has been in a state of incu
bation for at least a fortnight, but no defi
nite agreement could be reached until
Monday night. Various companies had
axes to grind, and they insisted upon hav
ing their complaints heard at these meet
ings, where pipes of peace were only sup
posed to be smoted and where a love
feast was intended to prevail.
There were bickerings enough at these
preliminary meeting, but they were all
kept quiet and were Unally adjusted nicely
and amicably.
This t)ein_- accomplished, the executive
committee of the old compact body â the
Board of Fire U nderwriters of the Pacific â
arranged for a formal meeting yesterday
morning, and it was carried out in a mo3t
perfunctory manner. Everything was cut
and dried, so the meeting aid not con-
Burue much time.
The following resolution was presented
and unanimously adopted:
Jtcsohed, That pendiug the promulgation of
raies oi premium, as provided in article V of
the constitution, the rates and ruiesof the
Hoard of Fire Underwriters of the Pacific
which were in force oti the 27th of March,
IS9o, are hereby adopted as an ed iuienm
measure, to be effective from noon of March
30, 1897, includiue such changes as have been
heretofore made by the Northwest Insurance
Association. Montana Board of Fire Under
writers, Board of tire Underwriters of Utah,
the Arizona Underwriters, me Southern Cali
fornia insurance Association and all local
boards now in existence in the State of Cali
lornia.
It being understood that the authority to
promulgate rates for all territory under its
jurisdiction is hereby vesiea solely in the
Ji'inrd ot Fire Underwriters of the Pacific.
That compensation to all agents, solicitors
and brokers permitted by this constitution
shall bo strictly adhered to* on and after April
7, 1897, excepting where contracts exist winch
cannot be canceled by April 7. 1897, and a
list of such contracts must be tiled with the
executive committee on or Dolor; tnat date,
nnd the basis of sealemeut of same must be
approved by said committee and nil contracts
to be settled by May 1, 1897. In tno mean
lime no member shall be permitted to increase
compensation to agents, solicitors or brokers,
und that ail agents shall tile the agret- mem
required by the constitution oa or before May
1. 15>97.
In ban Francisco policies may be written for
such applications as ar- now on tile, but after
the adjournment of this meeting no applica
tions snail t<e received except upon tne ex
plicit understanding that the policies thereon
shall bo written at the tariff rates as above
established.
Every member shall immediately notify
each of his agents of the rate of compensation
to which lie is entitled under the constitu
lion.uud no member shall cancel any con
tract with an ngent for a consideration with
out the consent mid approval of the executive
committee, nor agree to make any allowance,
payment, present or other valuable considera
tion of any kind or character to any of his
representatives or to any one for their ac
count.
With the exception of three of the
smaller companies all of the old crew have
signed the new compact, and the insur
ance men say the outlook is most pro
pitious for a season of prosperity. TAe
three which have held out are the Mil
waukee Mechanics Company, 'he North
west National and the FranKlin. It is
understood, however, that the Milwaukee
Mechanics is favorably inclined toward
the compact, and will, when it is assured
certain wmail concessions, get into camp.
The Thuringia Fire Insurance Company
has not yet consented to go in either, but
the compact people say it wiil join within
a day or two.
The object o! fixing April 7 as the date
for the permanent amalgamation is to
give those companies which have been
doing the fiercest cutting an opportunity
to ciose up their contracts and their cheap
line of business.
An attempt will be made after April 7 to
organize for a permanent season of ad
vanced rates, the most popular limit
among the compact brigade being ten
years. There is some doubt as to whether
or not this can be accomplished, but there
is 10 be a desperate effort to make the final
deal just the same.
It is agreed on all sides that the old high
rates of two years ago cannot be again at
tained, but the new programme wul carry
the figures as close to them as possible â
stopping probably at 20 per cent below the
former schedule.
The non-intercourse clause which has
raused so much trouble and brought
former negotiations to an unsatisfactory
conclusion has this time been tided over
satislactorily, so it is only a question of
agreement upon permanent rates that
Btands in the war of t he final consumma
tion 01 the bis scheme.
ROTTANZI PLEADED.
The Judiclnry Committee l> OT ed Jfot
to Consider Iliti High Hat Or
dinance Further.
Supervisor Rottanzi made a spirited but
futile effort to resurrect his high hat or
jinanco yesterday. Though not a mem
ber of the Judiciary Committee he ap
peared before that body yesterday to peti
tion that bis high-hat ordinance be given
favorable consideration.
Supervisor Smith told him that the
matter bad been indefinitely postponed
because City and County Attorney Cres
jvell had declared against its legality.
"But I have theopinions of Peter Dunne
ma Julius Kaun." said Rottanzi, "and
Ihey say it would be perfectly legai. 1 be
lieve it would be just as le.sat as ia*s pro
hibiting the obstruction of street?."
"You're all right, doctor," said Smith.
'They say down south of Market street
that you're a good physician, but you're a
poor lawyer."
I! ttarizi collapsed and the ordinance
iied.

WORDS FROM WORTH AND SOUTH.
Jipproval From Benieia and Objection From Gilroy, to tlje Pro
posed .New Constitution.
M. CASEY, MAYOR OF GILROY.
GILROY, Cal., March 24, 1897.
F.ditor Call: Ido not applaud fora new constitution. First, we know what we have and
don't know what we are to get; second, the new constitutional convention was composed of
sixty lawyers, the rest of the members were farmers and men of various trades and ca'.ling.
These members had a copy of the constitutions of nearly cv >ry State of the Union and adopted
tnat which was best, in their judgment, to meet our wants. Now, if these men were "sand-
Jotters," I wish wo had more ot tnem. The youne blood does not seem to be equal to the task
of driving out those hordes of Chinese and "Japs" which are driving our own flesh and blood
on the highways.
Take it here in my own neighborhood. Thousands of acres of the best land in the vicinity,
aye, in the State, tilled by Chinese, and nothing consumed by them but rice principally, which
is grown in China. Consequently, the home merchaut stands at his door and wonders why
business is dull, and the city merchant wonders why the country is so dull. 1 ask, Is the con
stitution to blame for it? I say no.
There are some amendments I would indorse, such as the single-tax system, as it simplifies
assessing and gathering taxes, and in the end would be a savine to the taxpayer and also com
pel those land barons to unload a little into the treasury, thereby giving an opportunity to the
man of moderate means to buy a Dome for himself and become a producer. M. Casey.
SUPERVISORS JAR
THE CONTRACTORS
Work Must Be Begun on
the Hall of Justice
at Once.
Bateman Brothers Warned That
The r Delays Are Un
justifiable.
A Sharp Note Eeit Them and Pro
ceedings Kay Be T^ken by the
Board to Force Matters.
Bateman Bros, have dnllied along about
be inning work on the Hall of Justice un
til they have aroused the ire of the Super
visors, and to-day ihey will receive a sharp
reminder that the building should have
started skyward long ago.
The matter came up before the.Build
ings Committee yesterday, and it was re
ported that though the contractors bad
promised to begin work several days ago
nothing had been done. Supervisor
Sheehan denounced the delay as out
rageous because of the depression in busi
ness in the part of town where the hall is
to be built and because there was really no
excuse for postponing work- He thought
the contractors had received enough
courtesy at the bands of the board, and
that it was time something wzs done to
show Bateman Bros, that the board was
in earnest and wanted proceedings begun
at once.
"These people will want extensions of
time when their ten months is up," he
said, "but I shall not be in favor of grant
ing them any unless they show a dis
position to hurry work on the Duilding."
Superintendent of Construction Buck
ley was called upon to state in what con
dition the contractor for the removal of
the debris had left the lot, and said in
that regard there was no obstacle to be
ginning at once.
Architect Shea said the mortar was all
ready and that the work should go on at
once.
Supervisor Sheehan called attention to
the fact that Bateman Bros, had not. as
required by the specifications, notified
the architect of the letting of the sub-con
tracts for iron, atone, terra cotta work,
etc.
Clerk Russell was instructed to send a
pointed communication to Bateman Bros,
warning that the board was growing im
paiient of delays and he prepared the fol
lowing:
Board of Supervisors, March 30, 1897.
MetÂ»r*. Bateman Bros : By order of the Com
mittej on I'ublic Buildings you are hereby
notified that the delay in the prosecuting of
the wor* of erecting the Ilall ol Justice) build
ing is wholly unjustifiable, hs no reason exists
why the work snould not be energetically
BLANTHER'S TRUNK.
The trnnk of Josef E. iilanther, murderer of Mrs. Philopena Lnngfeldt, reached
police headquarlers Irorn Meridian, Tex., yesterda)' rooming. It is a ranch-bat
tered, travel-worn article covered with leather and contained some old clothing
and personal effects belonging to Bianther which were collected by Detective Gib
son after Bianther was buried, and placed in the trunk. There are also some of
the trinkets taken from Mrs. Langfeldt's room, a number of manuscripts, letters
and books. The photographs takeu of the murderer are expected to-day.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1897.
carried on. No information or report has been
made of any sub-contrect of iron, granite,
terra coUh, mill work, etc., to the arcnitects,
as required by the specifications, and such
neglect indicates to the committee that there
is a want of systematic prosecution of the
wort, which will result In a failure on your
part, if rooro dilierrnce is not shown, to erect
the bui'.dlng within the contract time. This
course or protracting and preventing the wort
will, if persisted in, certainly militate against
and prevent any extension of time being
granted beyond the time fixed by the contract.
John a. Russell, Clerk.
It is understood that if work be not be
gun within a reasonable time, proceedings
will be taken to force the contractors to
keep their acre^mont.
PURE FOOD CRUSADE.
The Jury in the Case of Jacob
Salomon Fail to Agree and
Are I>is charged.
A jury in Judge Campbell's court Mon
day afternoon and evening heard the
case of Jacob Salomon, grocer, 396 Sixth
street, charged under the adulterated
food act with selling an imitation of cur
rant jelly.
The defendant was represented by At
torney Metson, and Assistant District
Attorney Dunne conducted the prosecu
tion, assisted by Prosecuting Attorney
Spinetti.
Thomas S. Taylor, Deputy Food In
spector, testified to buying at Solomon's
store a can of currant jelly on February
liG.and Professor Wenzell testified to maK
ing an analysis of the jelly and found that
it was composed of starch and one-fourth
currant jelly and three-fourths apple jelly.
After the arguments of counsel the jury
decided to retire and finish the case before
goinz to dinner. At 10 o'clock they re
ported they could not agree, ten being for
conviction and two for acquittal. The
Judge allowed them to co for supper, and
alter they returned he locked them up for
the night, but agreed to come to the court
at any hour if they had agreed upon a
verdict.
At 1 o'clock yesterdny morning one of
the jurors turned sick, and as they could
not agree the Judge was sent for and dis
charged them.
Herman Johnston, grocer, Sixth street,
charged with a similar offense, pleaded
guilty yesterday morning, and the Judge
lined him $25. A jury had been sum
moned to try the case, and they were told
their services were not requirej.
JOY ON THE HEIGHTS.
The Residents of "Scotch" Hill Are
Given Hopes for Water.
There was joy pictured over the faces of
the members of tne Southern Heights Im
provement Club Monday when President
"Bob" Bcott called the meeting to order.
This condition of happiness was made
manifest by the announcement that the
Supervisors will hold a special meeting
next Thursday evening in the committee
room of the board, to hear the petitiou of
the res. dents o: the heights for water.
That those on the Southern Heights are
earnest in their demand c*n be seen by
the large and enthusiastic meeting last
niÂ»ht when twenty-five new members
signed the club roll.
John Barduhn, president of Nuovo Po
trero Improvement Club, headed a dele
gation lrom body which offerÂ«>d Its
co-operation- wiih the Southern Heights
Club in obtaining a sufficient supply of
water. He volunteered his service "and
that of his club at %c meeting next
Thursday night.
GUSTAV GNAUCK, MAYOR OF BENICIA.
BENICIA, Cal., March 24, 1897.
Editor Ca'l: In view of the altered conditions now facing California it might be advisable
to readjust our constitution to meet the new state of affairs. Tlieru has been an attempt ma<l c
to keep ourselves abre sf of our needs by coutinunl amendments, which have so cumbered our
system of government as to in part alter the original structure. In town and county govern
ment, in taxation, in judicial authority, in legislative jurisdiction, there have been such radi
cal changes that a general modification along the whole line is almost an absolute necessity,
and this can better be obtained by an entire rebuilding of our fundamental laws.
Many of our most useful State commissions when they are really desirous of discharging
their duties are so hampered and restricted by judicial intervention as to be practically use
less. These matters should b-.> remedied.
In view of the disgraceful exhibition made every two years at our State Capitol, it might
be well to have our Legislature meet once in four years instead of every second year, and then
extend the session to 100 days instead of sixty. Of course, in any case good legislation could
only be obtained by sending honest representatives to Sacramento, and whether better ways
can be devised to attain this end remains to bs s^en. Also, in the government of towns, espe
cially towns of the sixth class, the authority of their trustees is in many cases so uncertain as
to often cause trouble. They should be given a simple code covering their government in a
general way, leaving more to the discretion of the local board, which should have power to
lower or raise the rate ot taxes on town property as they in their judgment deem just and
fair, in order to enable them to make the necessary improvements in their own town. Local
authorities ought to have power to levy, collect and retain all licenses, except State, for their
own benefit, instead of paying the same into the county treasury. In my opinion a change of
the State constitution at this time would prove a general benent to all. Respectfully yours,
GUSTAV GXAUCK.
TWO BIG CHIEFS
MUST WAIT AWHILE
Crowley and Sullivan Will
Not Get Their Salaries
To- Morrow.
Max Popper P.ays Them a Trick
Appropriate for All Fools'
Day.
Complaint Mad: That aa Extra Ex
p.nse of $60,000 a Y;ar Will
Be Incurred.
The threatened suit of Max Popper
aeainst City and County Auditor William
Broaerick was filed at noon yesterday.
The object of the . ction is to test the
validity of the new law which provides
for increasing the salaries oT mo bead
officers in the police and fire departments
of San Francisco. Chief Crowley and j
Chief Sullivan together with several of
their subordinates will be compelled to
wait awhile for their salaries, and after all
may have to content themselves with the
old figures.
Mr. Popper draws the attention of the
Superior Court to the fact that the last
Legislature passed an act having for its
object the payment of salaries as follows:
Chief of Police, $5000 a year; six captains
of police, $2500 each; clerk of the Chief of
Police and Board of Police Commission
ers. $2500; niteen detectives, $1800 each;
Chief Engineer of the Fire Department,
$5000; assistant chief engineer, $S600;
secretary or clerk, $30C0; assistant en
gineers, $2100 each; veterinary surgeon,
$1800.
In order to ascertain the intentions of
the Auditor in regard to the allowance of
these salaries ns herein specified, Mr.
Popper addressed Mr. Broderick on the
subject, ana received the following reply:
avditor's Office, )
Pan Francisco, Marcn 2tf , 1897. \
To Max Popper Esq.â -iv: In answer to yours
of March 24, wherein you say you believe the
bills passed by the Legislature increasing the
salaries uf certain police and fire department
officials aru unconstitutional, and tnat \ou
desire to know if it is my purpose to auditae
piands bosed thereon, I beg to say that from
inquiry I im Informed that the O'overnor be
fore signing said bills gave the question of
their constitutionality careful consideration,
and unless prevented by process of law. I pro
pose to audit the demands on the 31st of
March, ns all other demands for salary will be.
Respectfully yours, w. Broderick.
After furnishing this information to the
court Mr. Popper says that he has made a
calculation and finds that the now laws if
enforced will cause an additional expense
of $5000 a monih or $60,000 a year, which
he avers would be a burden on him and
all other taxpayers. He alleges that Au
ditor Broderick will carry out his threat
to nass the bills and allow their payment,
and points out that in this case there
would be no adequate method for recover
ing the money from the various recipients.
Considering the premises he asked tor the
issuance of an injunction restraining the
Auditor from acting in the premises until
the constitutionality of the law shall be
passed on by the conns.
Judge Seawell granted a temporary re
straining order and set the hearing before
him-elf in Depar merit 1 of the Superior
Court at 10 o'clock npxt Friday morning.
A Templar Drill.
The Grand Commanderr. Knights Templar
ot California, will give a Templar drill and a
ball at the Mechanics' Pavilion, on Friday
evening, April 23, for the benefit of the
Masonic Widows' and Orphans' Home. The
c.oors will be opened at 7:15 p. M . Â«nd from
7:45 to 8:15 (here will be a concert, then the
commandcry will form and march in review.
Afterward there will be short drills by the
various drill torps, and then dancing will
follow.
BIGELOW'S SURPRISE.
Charles A. Carlson, Whom He Thought
Dead, Swears * ut a Warrant for
His Arrest.
Charles A. Carlson, a patient in the City
and County Hospital, swore to a com
plaint in Judge Conlan's court Monday
morning, charging "John Doe" liigelow,
6GO Stevenson street, with embezzlement.
About a month ago Carlson, who had
been living in the same house with Bige
low, becinie ill and was sent to the hos
pital. Yesterday he was able to leave the
hospital, and on going to his room was
surprised to find that liia personal effects
and $25 in coin had disappeared.
Bigelow was equally surprised at seeing
Carlson, and said that be had been in
formed that Carlson had died at the hos
pital on March 6. Upon hearing of hi 3
death he had sold his effects, which Carl
son valued at $147.
Carlson demanded restitution, but could
set nothing, so tie went to i; c police court
and swore out a warrant for Bigelow's
arrest. He also obtained a search warrant
for the recovery of the property.
A Salmon Packing Injunction.
Scroral days ago the Alaska Packers' Asso
cintion commenced suit in the United States
Circuit Court against Joseph Hume and Hume
Brothers & Hume to enjoin the in'ringement
of a patented machine for automatically filling
cans with salmon. The invention was made
and patented by Matbiait Jensen of Astoria,
Or. Yesterday Judge Morrow granted the in
junction as prayed for, together with costs of
suit, and henceforth the Messr*. Hume must
pack their salmon by the old process. The in
junction is very broad, as it not only enjoin*
ihe further manufacture of the machines, but
prohibits the rebuilding and repairing 01 old
machines.

VISITED CHINESE
CIGAR-MAKERS
Semi-Official Inspection by
the State Labor
Bureau.
It Was for the Benefit of Union
Organizer James
Woods.
Flashlight Pictures of a Dcz n Fac
tories Wbere Chinese Are
Employed.
A semi-official inspection of a number
of Chinese cicar manufactories was made
yesterday by the Sta;e Labor Bureau for
the Lenefitof James Woods, organizer for
the International Cigar-makers' Union,
and fqr the local Cigar-makers' Union.
The investigating party consisted of
Deputy Labor Commissioner Cl ; ve Dam,
James Woods, El Rosen berg, secretary of
the San Francisco Labor Council; A. C.
Dale, secretary cf the locul cigar-makers,
and Thomas Chandler of the Internal
Revenue Department, who acted as an es
cort. Mr. Woods had a couple of photo
graphers with him wtio look tiasnhght
pictures of the interior of a dozen places
where Chinese make cigars.
The party bad hardly crossed Kearny
street on the way to the Chinese quarter
before the news of the approach of a rev
enue officer and several "white devils"
whose buoiness was not known was fly
ing around Chinatown, and the intruders
and the photographing outfit were the ob
ject of much curiosity and speculation.
Wherever pictures were taken the consent
of the proprietors was first obtained. In
nearly ali cases the permission was readily
given, but "a few otjscted, because they
did not know to what purpose the piciuies
were to be put. One proprietor positively
refused because his relatives in China are
now imprisoned because ot the feud be
tween the See Yur> and Sam Yao societies.
Ho was airaiit that the relatives of his
employes would be imprisoned if the pic
ture ever reached China.
During the trip but one really foul, filthy
place was encountered, showing that the
recent raids of the Board of Health's
officials had been of great benefit from a
sanitary standpoint. The place where so
much filth wus found is conducted by
Chun Suey, at 822 Jackson street. The
room is not over 12x12 and it is filled with
a cook-stove, beds and trunks, slop
buckets, beside the place wbere two fat,
dirty Chinese work at the benches. The
other places visited were the following:
Wing See Tonjr, 835 Jackson street; Quong
Och \V; h, 27 Ross a l*\v; Colombo &j ar
Co.. 1109 Dupont; Imperiale Co., 1115
Dupont; Fong Biug & Co., 6*U Pacific;
Wong Chock, 1117 Stockton; De Florida
Co., 1012 Stockton ; Lee Teck, 227 Ciay, and
Lee Him, 309 Battery.
Mr. Chandler stat?s that in this City
there are about 150 Chinese cigar factories
that employ all the way from one to 100
men. Mr. Woods is gathering statistics in
the cause of the white cigar-makers of
the United States. On April 1 he will
speak at tbe lower Metropolitan Hall,
where a public meeting will be held by
the Cigar-makers' Union, in conjunction
with the San Francisco Labor Council.

Morellito a Very Likely Coltâ Hazard
Won Very Eisilyâ Lincoln II
4Â»ain In Front.
The game at Incleside is getting just a
trifle ticklish: that is it will not do to
follow form with the same frequency and
recklessness as in the days of yore. One
shining example of the scope and latitude
allowed certain jockeys was furnished in
the second event on the card yesterday, a
lour and one-half furlong scramble for
two-year-olds. Among the starters was
Pat Dunne's slashing colt, Niton, which
opened a G to 5 choice, carded to be ridden
by "Willie Martin, the happy possessor of
a lioket-of-leave from the Jockey Club of
the far East. Niton's owner, Mr. Dunne,
is a nephew of Ed Corrigan, the master of
tiwthorne and of Ingleside. His jockey,
ill c Martin, is a past master ia the an
riding, but somehow or other has man
ned on several occasions to gain some
unenviable notoriety. Well, this colt
Niton was played down at the opening of
the betting with a rush.
Later two or ttiree bookmakers were
pieaseJ to accommodate speculators with
3 to 2, bu: favoied or figured as you like,
a colt by Moreilo, named Morelhto. This
latter youngster was said to have carried
the educated as weh &z the Middle West
ern coin. Useless to say, this same c* 1 !'
Mor Hi to came from away back in the
reav and the last jump Snider got him
i>ast the wire a head before Los Prietos,
which entry beat Hernioso bu; a neck.
William Protection Martin's ride a-tride
the backed-back favorite was the envy of
all who played the winner, and it would
not be Surprising if these admirers pre
sented William with a cup of some sort
bearing an engraving of the rider of Elk
wood Leing carried to the joct^ys 1 room
utterly exhausted after his effort, ana
bearing on :ns face such a look of an
guish us enshrouded the mobile counten
ance of "Pompadour Jim," which, by the
way, vanished two seconds after he had
been counted out. Niton was oh ? erved to
be a trifle lame after i.c pulled up, but he
t; pished awful well in hand for a lame
nurse.
A more summery tinge to the weather
attracted a larger crowd than on the
opening day of the week. Tne first
choices in the betting were a^ain in win
ning form, taking four of the six purses
iiung up.
OutsiJe ot Elsie Smith, the fifteen
maiden three-year-old.-, that went to the
r>ost in the first event â a six-furlong run â
were a very poor lot. Tne Burns A
Waterhouse fiiiy was an 11 to 5 choice in
the bettintr, ami skipping to the from al
most as soon as the barrier was raised led
all the way and won easily from Ros>ilbra,
the second choice. Altivo, tne third
choice, secured show honors.
Pat Dunne's recent purchase, Hazard,
was played down Jrotn 8 to 5 to evens, and
won the tnird race, ovtr a nuit?, derided
under sellinc conditions, without effort.
"Skeeis" Martin hustled him to the front
on neanr.g the half and he held the lead
to the end. finishing four lengths in ad
vance of the 12 to 1 chance, Meadow Lark.
Bueno, the second choice, was third.
The honest kit c chestnut Lincoln II
opened a4to 5 choice for tiie miie and a
quarter selling affair, hut such a stiff play
was made on Judge Denny, forcing his
odd? down from 5 to 1 to 13 to 5. that the
ring laid even money against tne favorite

There whs a little upset in the mile run

favorite led into the stretch and looked to
have the race in hand, but was cleveriy
beaten out by the 8 to 1 shot, San Marco,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1897.
THE GREAT RELAY RACE.
Considerable interest has been manifested among wheelmen regarding the big
100-mile relay race to take place on Sunday. In San Francisco the starting point
will be the corner of Tenth and Howard streets, thence to Ninth, down Ninth to
Folsom, out Folsom to Twenty-fifth and down Twenty-fifth to the San Bruno
road. Tho half mile added to the distance in San Francisco from the route of
previous years is made up at the finish in Alamedu. Instead of ending at Grand
street in that town, the finish will be on Central avenne, between Willow and
Walnut streetsâ two blocks from Willow-street station on the broad-gaupe road,
and three blocks from Chestnu -street station on the narrow-gauge, or six blocks
from Park-street station on either line. The map shows the line of the race and
the iocation of the various reiaya.
TWO RACES BUT
ONLY ONE PRIZE
Referee White Objected to
Too Much Team
Work.
He Disqualified Stevens and
McFarland for Unfair
Riding.
The Mile Record Again Lowered,
This Time by Wing of tha
Oympics.
Orlando L, Stevens of Otturuwa, lowa,
won both professional events at the in
door cycle meet last night; but one of his
victories was wrested from' him by the
referee, who disqualified him and MsFar-
Jand in the final of the half mile for team
wont.
The decision created considerable com
ment, but the public supported it by ap
plauding, and certainly the people who
pay to see the men ride are the ones to
please.
Kenna had an easy i'aing of it in the
mile amateur race, and Wing, the Olym
pic's speedy amateur, lowered tne world's
indoor record for a mile in an exhibition
ride.
There was a fair-sized and hishly en
thusiastic audience to witness the con
tests. To-night, when the great match
between Wells, Eaton, Longhead and
B ecker conies off, there should be a tig
crowd. Newsboys ere to be admitted free
to the baicony to-night.
Five preliminary iiÂ«ats reduced the field
in the mile open professional to trn men,
who rode in three semi- finals to qualify for
the Anal. Eaton, Loughead ami Allen
rode in the lirst. Eaton took first place
by a good margin and Loughead, ; hinting
he had second place safe, sat up before the
tatie was reached and Alien parsed him.
In the second Jones, Stevens and Sulli
van started and finished in that order,
Jones and Stevens making ail the fighting.
McFaiJand, Bob Terrill and Downing
rode in the third. McFarland purposely
made it slow, so that Stevens, who was
second in the fastest heat, the second,
would qualify, nnd he did. McFarlaud
won, Terrill pressing; him closely.
This brought Eaten, Jone-, Stevens and
McFarland into the final. Stevens and
McFarland resorted to their usual team
tactics and when the time to sprint came
Stevens was in the load and won all the
way, Jones running a close second, Eaton
third. Referee White disqualified dtoveiiÃ
and McFarlnnd for their team work on
the ground that it militated against the
chances of other men in the race and
awarded the prize money to Jones an i
Eaton, a decision which a majority of the
audience roundiy applauded, though some
eemed to think that McFarland and
Stevens had not resorted to any unfair
advantage. Stevens, incidentally, is vefv
popular with the riders and the public
and ma a good many sympathizers.
The field in the mile open, professional,
was narrowed down by the preliminary
heats to Wells. Morns, "Bob" Terrill,
Davis, Dow, McFariand, Stevens and Sul
livan. These rode in two semi-finals,
first and second, to qualify for the final.
A bad fall occurred in the first semi
final. McFarland was in front on the last
turn. Davis was second and jrunc; wide,
and Terrill rode up behind McFarland.
Davis swerved down on Terrill and threw
him, and Dow fell over him. Terrill es
caped wiih a severe scraping, but Dow
was considerably bruised and suffered a
dislocated shoulder.
Stevens took the second semi-final

MANY HOME CURES,
Evidence at Home, Which Is the Best Evi=

Electric Belt.

science, including^||%Â§Â£. soon as it touches
a perfect regulator^fe^lg the body, and is

A remedy which makes its claim for merit based upon the cures
performed at home must be honest â its cures must shine out - strongly
as a beacon light to other sufferers. They must be real, genuine cures,
in which people can place confidence, for the authors of such . letters
can be found and their friends can â  testify to what they say. Such is
the foundation upon which the claims of Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt are
based. It is easy to find men who claim to have been cured by it, for
they are men of good standing and /unquestioned honor among their
fellows. Whether in nervous troubles which medicine cannot reach, in
Rheumatism, Kidney or other organic weakness, loss of manly power or
troubles of the female sex, Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt will cure after
the failure of all other remedies. .

appeared after ' a short rest. Most of $ the
money up was on Wells, but he disap
pointed his backers, and could do no bet

The finish was more of a procession
than a race, a coupfe of wheels' lengths
separating each man from the other.
There was one amateur race on the pro
gramme last night, and, considering the
insignificant value of the prizes offered,
the wonder is that the management got
any entries for it. But amateurs are sup
posed to ride more for glory than for in
trinsic reward, anyway, and so about a
dozen of them showed up for that reason,
{or surely the I prizes of $15, $7 50 and $4
offered no attraction for them. â  >; â 
Kenna of the Bay City, Russ and Win*
of the Olympic Wheelmen, and Bacon of
the Olympic Cyclers qualified for :., the
final. When Kenna thought it about the
right time he went ahead and won with
apparent ease, hi i 'â â  only real ; competitor
being Bacon. Russ : and Wing were
lengths behind. ' ,v â¢ 'â -' â â .'â 'â 
The management should promote at
least one good amateur race each night;
and put up prizes for it worth riding for.
The amateurs of this State are entitled to
far more consideration* than they have
been shown at this meet so far.
J. E. Wing of the Olympic Club Wheel
men lowered Kenna's mile 1 record, made
Monday night, to 1:58 1-5, paced by two
tandem teams. It was a splendid ride
and was liberally applauded. â¢

NOTES OV THK MEET.
Referee White's decision disqualifying Ste
vens and McKarlund iii the n iai of the balf
miie was well within his powers and pleased
every one but the two directly interested.
A series of tnree match races at one, two
and live miles between Well* and Fester is
bi.lea for Friday night for a purse of $400,
winner to take all.
The feature of to-night's pro?rnmmÂ« is the
four-man match between Wells, Becker,
Loughead and Eaton.
Starter Lenile's only fault seems to be that
he holds the men too long at the tape before
sending them off.
Announcer Knaiip says his "indoor king"
(Eaton) won't net his meals regularly if he
does not hurry up and win some races.
Scratch races are largely in fsvorof the top
notchers like Becker, Longhead, Wells, Ste
vens and men in mat class. A few handicaps
should be run to uive the other less speedy
"pros" a chance to win a prize or two.
To-night the management will admit to the
bÃlcony free all newsboys who apply at the
small Larkin-street entrance to the Pavilion.
"Bob" Terrlll had his first fall durins the
meet last night. He weighs 190 pounds mid
fill when goiug at top speed, but fortunately
a severe shaking up was his only discomfort.

NEW YORK. N. " '. I March 38.â There wai a
distinctly better tone to-the markets for securities
to-day. The apprehension in regard 10 the recent
decision of thei<UDr?me Court disappeared in a
measure because of the announcement that the
leading officials of the Western associations bad
given orders to the freight agents to maintain
rates and because of sta events which were after
ward confirmed that the counsel for the Joint
Tiallic Association would advise the continuance
of the association until the Supreme Court had an
opportunity to pass upon its legality. Only one re
action of Importance occurred during the session
and that was In sympathy with the sudden break
in Jersey Central from 85% to 82 on a revival of
the rumors recently current that the dlvldenl will
b? reduced.
It la to be said that even this failed to dislodge
long stocKs In any considerable amount, and tLe
decline from the highest point of the morning whs
only 14 to I*4 per cent outside of Leather pre
ferred, whicu oroke Vi/a to 55i,i. Near the close
speculation developed m ewed strength on the
announcement from Washington that an amended
railway pooling bill had men In nod need in the
Ben-'te by Senator Baker, and that efforts were
making to have the bill become a law. on ibis
there was a fresh movement â  to cover shorts, and
the market clrsed strong In lone. Net changes

Britain's I lags.
Before tbe crowns of England and Scot
land were united und^r James I, says the
Scottish American, the flag carried by the
English ships was white, with the red
cross of St. George emblazoned on it,
while that hoisted upon Scottish ships
was blue, with the cross of St. Andrew
on it, the red lines of the English flag
being perpendicular and horizontal, and
those of the Scottish flag being diagonal.
Owing to some misunderstanding between
the ships of the two nations, the King
ordered "tnat a new flag should be
adopted, having the cross of St. George
interlaced with that of St. Andrew on the
blue ground of the flag of Scotland." All
English ships were to display the red
crossof St. George, and Scottish ships that
of St. Andrew at their sterns. On April
12, in the year 1606, the Union Jack was
first hoisted at sea, but it was not until
the Parliamentary Union of the two coun
tries, in the year 1707. that it was adopted
aa the military flag of Great Britain.

Gradually Weaned From
H;s Home.
Miss Kittie Johnson Boldly Acknowl
edges the Part She
Played.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,[
008 Broadway, March 30. f
A pathetic story came to light to-day
when Mrs Halburton told of how a homo
had been wrecked by a pretty nurse, who
gradually weaned Halburton from his
home. Ail the parties to the unhappy af
fair are well known in this city.
Halburton is one of the cleverest elec
tricians on the coast and held a responsi
ble position in the OaKland Gas Light and
Heat Company. Five years ago in New
York he married Miss Catherine Mann, a
handsome young lady, 19 years of age.
Her father was both waalthy and influen
t^tjil and had a loveiy home on the Hud-
Soon after the marriage the couple
pHame to California, where the husband at
Tmce entered a position previously offered
him.
The Halburton home was very happy for
about four years. A little boy and girl
were born and the future seemed very
bright. December, 1595, Mrs. Halburton
look a trip to her home in the East. At
the same time Mr. Brition of the gas
company went East with his wife, leaving
his niece. Miss Kitty Johnson, in charge
of his home and incidentally committinc;
both niece and home to the care of Hal
burton.
Halburton proved himself unworthy of
the confidence of his employer, ar.d when
Mrs. Halburton returned she soon discov
ered a very unpleasant condition cf af
fairs. Sue told her sorrowful story this
afternoon.
"Tuat young woman," she said, "has
ruined my home. We were veiy happy
until Miss Johnson crossed our path, and
nothing that I can say will express my
fee: ings for her.
"I went East in December of '95 and re
turned in Apnl. Miss Johnson was left
in charge of my relative's home, and that
is where the trouble originated. She is
an adopted daughter, I think, of Mrs.
Eastland. However, this fact did not
check her desiens on my husband, for I
feel certain she started out to take him
iiom me at that time.
I came home I could not stop
the infatuation, and when we moved to
the Market-street block siie bad the
audacity to tell me that she loved my
husband. We had a wordy war, after
whicn she promised to leave him alone. I
did not believe her and told her so. That
seemed to make her angry, and even when
we came to San Francisco she continued
her attentions.
"One day I was downtown, and I
dropped into tbe Nurses' Home. There I
asked 11 Miss Joht.son was in. I found
out from the matron that she was, and
also that my husband was a frequent
Visitor. The nurse* thought the two were
engaged, not Knowing ihat he was mar
ried.
"I told them of the true status of affair",
and Miss Johnson was immediately dis
charged.
"Then my husband found her rooms in
the San Remi Hotel, and paid for them,
trying in the meantime to tell me that he
had left her for good."
Miss Johnson Is very positive in the
matter and speaks very plainly. When
seen at the hotel she sud: "The outcome
of this will be tnat I will marry George,
that's all. If this woman bad any sense
she would co East, where she belongs. I
Jove him and he loves me. It is no use
trying to separate us now.
"I understand that her father is coming
here to shoot somebody. Let him come,
I don't care. She threatened to shoot me,
but she is a coward and did not dare.
"I told her I would leave her husband
alone, but she doubted me, so I am now
in it to stay. lam awfully sorry for the
trouble this will cause my folKs, but I
can't help it now."
. Halburton is employed in the gas works
at Stockton, having left his home, but
although be makes frequent trips to San
Francisco he never visits his wife. She is
a Catholic and says she will not get a
divorce, nor will she permit him to do co
if she can prevent iÂ».
GAZED AT A RED SPOT.
Theodore Pettifi s on Trial for
Murdering His
Friend.
The Winehouse on the Diagram Was
Colored a Erght Blooi
Red.
k Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
â¢ , 008 Broadway, March 30. f
In Judge Ogden's court this morning a
young man named Theodore Pettiiils sat
gazing at a little bright red square in a big
diagram tacked on the wall by the County
Surveyor. On that, diagram in a great
measure, and especial'y on the red spot
upon it, depends the life of the young lel
low who watched it so intently, while the
District Attorney and the Surveyor ex
plained its meaning to the jury.
There was just a touch of irony in mark
ing that particular epoi a bright red, as
all the rest of the buildings on the chart
were a dirty drab, and the prisoner visibly
phuddered when the explanation was
made that the red spot was the wine
house. â  ...
Last Christmas day a party of laborers
were enjoying a sumptuous dinner on the
Paris ranch near Livermore., Instead of
talking about peace and good will; and
other things, which are general y sup
posed to be germane to Christmas time, the
men partook of the red wine from the
winehouse until hatred and anger stirred
their souls.
Among the company were Theodore
Pe'tifils and Frank Garrique. The two
men, Â« friends when sober, were always
quarrelsome after looking too lone on the
red. wine. They commenced the conver
sation about a subject upon whicn they
could not agree, snd ?oon were Involve 1 in
a violent quarrel. In the middle of :it.
Pettifils > took his ; gun from his pocket,
placed it on the table and said to Gar
rique, "If you are not a coward let us set
tie this matter right here." Friends in
tervened and prevented a conflict, but the
haired between the two men was - only
stifled temporarily. : .â 
After he dinner th" two men walked 1

from the eating-house toward the wine
house. Gamque did not arrive there. On
the way he was struct on the back of thÂ«
tiead and injured so seriously that he died
;hree days later. Pettifils was the last
man seen in his company and was the
only man who was known to have quar
reled with the murdered laborer.
After the murder suspicion at once fell
on Petting, and in the excitement that
overcame him he made some damaging
admissions. All these facts were told this
morning by Deputy District Attorney
Church in his opening statement to the
jury, and he said that the people Were pre
pared to prove every link in the cuain of
cv. deuce that he had outlined and ahieh
would undoubtedly prove that Pet.irils
was guiity ot the crime of murder, as
charged.
The County Surveyor next explained the
diagram showing where the men left the
eating-house, and just how far they had
got when Garr qne was iatally struck.
Mr. Church then took hold of tue diagram
and made the details a littte plainer, con
nectine them with the theory of the mur
der which tie will attempt to substantiate.
Mr. Paris Jr. gave some testimony tend
ing to show that Pettiiils was the polity
party. After the injured man was found
Mr. Paris and his wife drove downtown,
and on the way they met Petiiuls. Mr.
Paris said. "I guess you kicked him
pretty hard?"
"Yes," replied Petti fils; "but I could
not help it; be is always picking at me."
Pettifiis* then asked the witness, "Will
you do me a favor?" W liie Paris wa^
hesitating Pettifils sa.d, "I know I will
be arrested for battery, and I don't want
to 'iave a charge of carrying a concealed
weapon placed against me." He then
gave Paris his revolver.
Mr. Pans then described the manner in
which Garrique was taken sick and how
he suffered until he became unconscious
and finally died. The trial will be con
tinued to-morrow.
CANNOT CREDIT THE NEWS
Miss Isabel Murphy's Attorney
Does Not Believe the Dis
patches Abaut Her.
Special Letters of Adm nistration
Asked Pending tha Probate
of Her Will.
Oakland Office Sax Feaxcisco Call,)
90:4 Broadway, March 30. j
The receipt of a dispatch this afternoon
from .London, stating that the Coroner's
jury had returned a verdict that ileath Sn
the case of Miss Isabeile Murphy had
been caused by alcoholism, was a gi'eat
surprise to Victor Metcalf, her attorney.
The dispatch stated tnat the deceased
had been a heavy drinker, and that, she
had left all h r property, valued at half a
million dollars, to a Roman Catholic
priest, named S. Mullen.
"I have no private advices," said Mr.
Metca f this afternoon, '-other tnan the
cablegram received a few days ago notify
ing me of the death of Miss Murphy.
TLe dispatch received to-day seems to me
to be incredible. Miss Murphy has been
in poor health a long time, and was re
quired to use crutches during the contest
in the courts in this city. She was in
clined to stoutness, which might have in
dicated a tendency to apoplexy.
"She was a youn.' woman of strong
mind, and I do not think it at all likely
that she would, permit herself to be con
trolled by any one. I am greatly sur
- prised at the statement that she n>*dfl the
priest her sole legatee, for it is entirely at
variance with her intentions, very fre-
I quently expressed, of leaving her estate to
her two sisters in case she diea first.' Miss
Isabelle was one of the most amiable of
trie sisters, and appeared to be the most
friendly toward her brothers. la return
for this kindly feelins on her tart her
brothers during the contest made no di
rect charges against her of having influ
enced their mother to exclude them and
Lady "Wolsey trom sharing in her
, estate.
"I cannot credit the statement that Miss
i Isabelle Murphy was a heavy drinker, as
I have never seen anything in her conduct
to indicate it. So far as her interests in
California are concerned, from which her
; income was largely derived, they have
I been in my hands. I have transmitted
money to her frequently and have beard
from her many times, but 1 have never
heard a word of any one named Mullen.
I cannot see how it is possible ior the
' statement to be true that the priest ac
companied her on a trip to this country.
She came to this country after her father's
death, but since the death of her mother
she has .only been in this country once,
and that was in 1891, when she camp with
her sisters. At the trial a priest named
Dunstan "Sweeney testified that be had
come to this country subsequent to the
visit of the Misses Murphy."
- George D. Metcalf, the other attorney
for the estate, was equally surprised at,
the news. "It seemj strange to me," he
said, "that the contents of the will should
be disclosed so soon. The way in which
it is said that she has disposed of her es
tate seems incredible, in view of the many
statements regarding her property in case
of her death which sue has made to my
knowledge." â¢
Late this afternoon Victor Metcalf filed
a petition for spec ai letters of administra
tion on the estate of Mary I. Murp'iv,
pending the probate ot her will. His
bond was fixed at $100,000. i^^vC/ :

Is Being Dragged in
the Mire.
Boh Sides to the Will Cont?st
Seem Disposed to Seek
Peace.
Many Prominent Peop'e's Nam?s Are
Being Dragged Into the Un
pleasant Affdr.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broad way, March 30. j
A sensation was sprung in tbe Pardee
will contest to-day when it became known
that application would be made to tbe
court to take the depositions of several
prominent people. So many names have
been mentioned in the contest of the
widow and in her deposition tnat it can
not be told who may not be drawn into
the proceedings, which are now becoming
somewhat scandalous.
The deposition ol the widow, which has
just been closed, recites in greater detail
the story told by Mrs. Emily C. Pardee in
the contest against the will of Her hus
band tiled some months ago. It is now
evident that tne skeletons which have
been closely guarded in the old Pardee
homestead for years are now to be cx
i posed to the microscopic search of the
attorneys. There is ample material on
which to base sensations without end,
and as both tbe widow and the son, Dr.
G. C. Pardee, have expressed their de
termination to fight the case to the bitter
end, the scandal-mongers are likely to be
satiated.
A new feature in the case is the turning
of the old homestead in;o a select board
j ing-house. Of course, this is very repus-
I naut to the son, but the widow declares
! that it is necessary for her to do it, in or
! der to permit of her keeping up the style
1 that she was accustomed to during the life
iof her husband. Whether this be so or
i not cannot now be ascertained.
Ever since the contest was filed ttjere
: has been a great deal of curiosity shown
| concerning the identity of a person re-
I ferred to as a "Big Black Jew."
The widow alleges that her husband,
during the last few years of bis life, fre
! quently expressed himself as having
cause to be jealous of a "Big Black Jew."
It is now stated that the identiiy of the
verson here mentioned has been discov
ered, and thai at the proper time ins uo
j position will be taken.
The bitter hatred that existed for years
I between the widow and stepson is becom
ing more and more apparent at every
move.
The unpleasant details of tne eighteen
years of married life, commencing witn
I the sensational and lorced marriage, are
â¢ gradually being unfolded, and little by
| little the man whom all Oakland re
! spected in official and social iife is being
i mnde to assume a different role.
There seems to be no limit to the
j amount of sensations of many degrees
i th*t the lawyers on either side seem
| ready to sprin .-, and unless a compromise
is effected the fair name of Pardee bids
fair to be dragged in the mire as no other
prominent family name has ever been in
I this city.

within the legal definition, of a political
convention, and consequently the nomi

against allowing any other organization

A Receiving Hospital.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 30.â 1n pur
suance of the petition presented to the
Supervisors yesterday nsking for the es
tablishment of a receiving hospital in the
city, Supervisor Talcott visited Alameda
to-day to inquire into the matter. The
need of such an institution is conceded,
and the only obstacle is the question of
ways And means. It is expected that it
will be located in the new city Hall, and it
will require an expenditure of less than
$150 a month to run it.

"AIDA'S" GREAT SUCCESS
A Brilliant Performance by the
French Opera Com
pany.
Marsart, Alb?rs and Mma. FoeJor
Make th? Hits of the
Evenin*.
"The performance of "Aida" at the Cal
ifornia Theater last night was uiio of the
most brilliant successes of the French
opera season. At every point where ap
plause could ba interpolated the audience
showed its appreciation of the artists' ex
cellent work by enthusiastic applause, and
at the end of the third act the curtain
calls bestowed unon Mme. Fojdor, Massari
and Albers were so numerous that it al
most seemed as if the house would not be
pacified till one of the singers made a
speech.
"Aida," like "The Huguenots," de
mands a pretentious mise en scene, in ad
dition to fine artists and a big orchestra
and chorus. Special scenery had been
painted for last night's performance, and
some of it was imposing and artistic, par
ticularly the temple scene and the scene
by moonlight on tbe banks of the Nile.
Tbe company again showed that it is well
bupplied with costume?, and great taste
and skill were displayed in grouping tbe
chorus and ballet.
The triunn h scene, with its long march,
was managed so well that there wub none
of the hilarity which the audience so fre
quently displays when RhadameÂ»' army
comes marching in. On the contrary, the
impression was conveyed of fresh people
constantly entering, and tbe march ended
in a gorgeously effective tableau.
The cast was a splendid al -round one,
the three artisis especially singled out 'or
finplause being Massart, Albers and Mme.
Foedor. Massart'9 Rhadames is one of the
ant pieces of work liv has done here. He
acted with more ireedom than in most if
his roles and the heroic character of the
music suited his voice.
It goes without saying iiiat Henri Al
bers, who acts as well an be sing 3, was
thoroughly at home in lha tragic role of
th Ethiopian king.
Mme. Foedor made an excellent Aida,
and her colored make-up was infinitely
more becoming than the paint and fea
thers she adopted in "L'Africaine. " The
heavy music 01 Aida's lines suited her
powerful dramatic voice. Her plaintive
rendering of "Pnie mon Dieu, C'est trop
souffrir" was especially appreciated,
though the same may be said of her scene
with Amneris in the second act and her
scenes with Aborts and Massart on the
bant of the Nile.
Mme. Fremau was an excellent Amneris,
ihouL'li t lie exacting music brought out a
few signs of wear in her fine voice. Javid
was pood as Pharoah nncl Allies was satis
factory as tbe High Priesr.
As usual the choruses were not up to
tbe standard of the soloists, though some
good ensemble singing was done. In the
grand march tbe trumpets were a shade
sharper than the orchestra, but they were
played with precision, and their long an
tique appearance added considerably to
tlie picturfcsqueness of the scene. The
ballets were very effective, and altogether
"Aida" was such a brilliant success that
the management has decided to repeat it
next Wednesday in place of "The Hague
no'.e."
VETS AND THEIR "MOTHER."

MAYOR THOMAS
OUT FOR HARMONY
Outlines Practical Ideas for
the Coming Two
Years.
Does Not Believe in a Niggardly
Policy of Running the
City.
Will Fx the Tax Lsvy at a Rate
That the T. xpayers Shall
Decide Upo.i.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
9tiÃ Broadway, Marcb 30. J
Mayor Thomas outlined to-day the pol
icy be will pursue during his next two
years. Although he will, next Monday
night, present a formal inaugural address
to the City Council, the following state
ment embodies His plans to be carried out
during bis term of office. Hesa<d:
The city will pay for my time, and I shall
try to make the labor woithy of the hire. My
office hours shall be those of a business man
and my ear always open to advice. By this I
do not mean to say that I shall be in the office
all ol the time. The duties of the Mayor are
many and much of the work must be done
outside of the hall. Improvements must be
watched and personal nupervision will be
necessary, but when I am not in the office
some one else will be there to answer all ques
tions and attend to such minor nutters as
may be advisable.
The tax rate is a matter to which I have
given much consideration without arriving at
any unchangeable conclusion. The people pay
the taxes, and they shou.d be the judge of the
amount. Their ideas I shall respect. I be
licvo they have no opposition to a talr rate so
long as they know the money will be
judiciously expended. In that I shall try to
win the confidence of the people, und I think
our ideas conform now. We want a rate that
will give us a good, business-like advancing
administration. Nut a rate that will assist
prodigality, but the lowesi possible rate that
will maintain the departments in their present
efheiency and build something which is in the
line of permanent improvement. Ourpresent
Auditor is very familiar with our local finan
cial questions, and I shall carefully consult
him iv the matter o! taxes.
Our streets 1 believe are our principal points
of improvements, although the need of parks
and breathing spaces I do not ovenook. Of
course city funds ate at an ebb just at present,
for at the end of every fiscal year our finances
run low, tut as soon as the taxes tor 1897-98
are rtccivt-d our work of Improvement w.ll
begin. We have n good council. I have
studied its personnel and I am ratified it will
do what is right. That the administration
will Le harmouious I am certain. We want
business not politics.
The present method of having the city as
sist in defraying the expenses of substantially
macadamizing the main thorough fares I am
in sympathy with and the work of improving
the Wfit Oakland Park 1 bel.eve should be
pushed to completion immediately. â We
should have a rural park a few miles from the
city with -a well-kept shaded driveway or
b >ulevard leading to it. I shu 1 advocate this
as Miou aa I see that we can afford it.
The schools will have a warm supporter in
Mr. Thomas, and the prosp-.cts are that the
Education Board and the chief executive will
soon be warm friends.
Tue present tfneency must not be lowered,
andduriug my administration they shall never
fh.se for lack ol money. It is ridiculous to
stint the educational facilities of our children.
We are not poor enough to be compelled to,
and there is ao reason why we should not
be liberalâ very liberalâ with the school de
partment.
The library and the reading-rooms re
semble the schools, and in my opinion they
should be carefully provided for. Our intel
lectuality we cannot afford to neglect. The
reading-rooms are for the poor, aud in jus
tice, not in charity we must see to their
wants.
As a private citizen I havo watched the fire
and ponce departments, and believe them to
be efficient. They are important tactors to a
cily's !-afe;y, and appreciating this as I do. 1
shall not be the one to hamper or impede
them.
The water-front litigation must not bi neg
lected. Oakland is destined to become a
maritime city, and the sooner we put the
water front in a condition 10 invite shipping
and shi; ping interetts tbe sooner our destiny
will materialize.
The city sa ary roll will receive no cuts
from my bunds. I believe in employing com
petent and worthy clerks and paying them for
me good service which we than luok for from
them.
The new bill recently signed by the Gov
ernor requiring the Miyor's approval to all
expenditures exceeding sloo, and also making
nine votes in the Council necessary to cver
rido a veto, will of course give the Mayor
much more power, but the Council need
not f J ar mo. I snail caremlly investigate
all of the Sr'499 resolutions which have been
so frequent.y adopted by Councils, and may
do some little clipping in thenmounts. But I
shall thoroughly examine the needs for the
mouey, and shall make no reduc;ions miles* I
have a good reason tor so doing, and that rea
son I shall always give to the council. Much
money can be saved in these small matters
and put to better use.
Wo are all working for a common end, and
if we would accomplish it we must work har
moniously. The new Board of Public WAcs
will, I think, be conservative in the matter of
poilcy changes. We will be assisted by the
counsel and advice "f the Merchants' Ex
change, the Board of Trade. Good Roads Asso
ciation and kindred organiz Uious in all mut
ters concerning material public necessities,
and by listening to and heeding the advice of
the people we r.re not apt to do wrong. The
time is propitious and there is no reason why
this admiiiisirailonÂ»snouid not. leave some
lasting monument in the line of public better
ment to its memory.
Colored Brethren Fall Oat.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 30.â W. S. Linn
swore to a complaint to-day charging
Brother King with battery. Both are col
ored men of good standing of the Zion
Methodist Church. Linn's face looks as
though it had been worsted in an encoun
ter with a haycutter. He alleges that last
Sunday night King came to tbe church
door and called him out. As soon as he
got to the threshold King felled him with
a sandbag. The two brethren then mixed
and the congregation separated them.
No one will give any explanation of the
origin of the affair.

The annual meeting was held at the In
stitute last night. Assistant Secretary J.

tions of the association during the past
year. The document is concise and com
prehensive. It shows that the School of
Design has had the mo^t prosperous year

tion with the faculty how they could
accommodate all the applicants. There

night class is acknowledged.

total 616.
The nuances of the institution are in a
satisfactory condition. The balances in
the several funds are: Permanent art fund
$14,252 63. Searles house fund $5113 38, gen

THEY WILL INVESTIGATE.
Health Authorities Startled at
the Dsath of Mrs. Mollie
Hagan.
May Have Contracttd Typhoid Fever
While Incarcerated ia the
City Prison.
The case of Mrs. Mollie Hagan, who
died at the City and County Hospital yes
terday of typhoid fever, which is recog
nized as an infectious disease, has some
what startled tne Board of Health, inas
much as it is quite possible and indeed
probable that she contracted the disorder
while an inmate ol the City Prison.
An investigation of the sanitary ar
rangements of the prison, similar to the
one made several months ago, will proba
bly be made with a view of ascertaining,
if possible, from whence the germs thai
ended Mrs. Hagan's liie emanated.
Mrs. Hagan and her husband, John R.
Hawaii, quarreled on February 26, at their
residence. 33 South Park, and in a mo
ment of anger she stabbed him in the left
breast with a carving knife. He was
taken to tne Receiving Hospital, and for
some days his life was despaired of, but he
slowly improved, ana is now out of
danger.
Mrs. Hasan wai arrested within twenty
four hours, and after being detained at
the City Prison ior several days, was
charged with assault to murder, as her at
torney bad applied for a writ of habeas
corpus. Her case was assigned to Judge
Conlan's court.
On March 16 she was removed from the
prison o the Receiving Hospital, it wai
thought that she was suffering from pneu
monia, but on March 20 tvplioid fever de
veloped, and she was sent to the City and
County Hospital, where she died yes
terday.
She was only 21 years of age, and bad
been married for four years. Sh leaves a
little girl who is being cared for by her
parents in Aiam d;i.
Dr. Williamson of the board said that
the matter had been called to his atten
tion, but that no action had been decided
on, though tni* case would, of course, be
investigated. He said the woman might
or might not have contracted the disease
in the City Prison.
"The germt of the disease often lurk in
people's Dodies for some time before they
cause any serious discomfort," lie said,
"and Mrs. Ha an might have contracted
typhoid fever before her arrest.
"The plumbing of the prison may be
responsible for the case, but an investiga
tion will be necessary to settle that point.
It was repaired some time ago, I uniier
sta ml, ar.d should be in good condition."
NOW WANT THE RAILS.
Sixth-Street Business Men Desire an

A number of fc>ixth-street business men

what could be done toward an electric

They stated that iho railroad company

Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the mod severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and under
such a strain meu are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tosxed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
his throub'.es. But providential inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated Darts to natural size and vigor, and
be now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his nacre and address may
have the method or this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.

THE FROST
DID SOME
DAMAGE
Injury to the Fruit Blos
soms and to the
Buds.
REPORTS SO FAR ARE
MEAGER.
It Was Worst in the Upper
Sacramento Val
ley.
ALMONDS AND APRICOTS SUF
FERED.
\
la Many Sections the Fruit Was
Not Far Enough Ad
vanced.
The almond, apricot and peach orchards
of Northern and Central California,
promised ouch an abundant yield one
week ago, have been damaged to some ex*
tent by the severe fronts of last Sunday \
and Monday nights. The extent of the
damage cannot be measured now, but
fruit-growers assert, mat first reports usu
ally overestimate the disaster.
The cold wave swept over the entire
State and the line of sharp frost was ex
tended as far south as Tulare. The frost
even touched the apricot and peach bios
corns in the orchards of Pomona.
In some localities last night there were
indications of another frost, but tbe
weather generally had moderated.
Direct intelligence from the Upper Sac
ramento Valley is to the effect that con
siderable damage will result from the
frost of Sunday night The loss on tbe
almonds, apricots and peaches of the Bid
well ranch, near Ciiico, is estimated at
$35,000. The loss, it is said, is mainly con
fined to apricots and almonds.
Along the line of the Donabus road,
irom Petaluma to Cloverdale, many of
the buds and blossoms of the fruit have
been bruised by tbe frost. Some of the
orcbar Is escaped, while others adjoining
â¢were nipped. It is thought that the fruit
was not far enough advanced to be seri
ously damaged.
The reports from Napa County are
similar to those received from Sonoma.
The cold weather earlier in the season
had retarded the budding, hence the
orchards mar not be seriously injured.
The reports from the Santa Ciara Val
ley are not discouraging. The region was
visited by Jack Frost, but the dama-e to
the orchards is thought to be slight. The
growers take a hopeful view of the situa
tion.
In the foothills of the Sierras the fruit
was not sufficiently advanced to be in
jured by the cold weather. In San
Joaquin County some damage was done,
but horticulturists differ as to the extent
of the blast.
According to reports received by fruit
growers in the City yesterday the greatest
loss will fall on the orchardists of Shasta,
Tebama, Butte and Colusa counties.
The orchards of Yolo, Solano and Con
tra Costa counties sustained some injury,
but several days must elapse before an ac
curate estimate of the losses can be made.
The frost was certainly disastrous, but
the extent of the disaster is not ascer
tained.
The Weather Bureau last night pre
dicted further frosts in the region of coun
try isouth of San Francisco.
PAST HORSES FOR MEXICO.
R. C. Fate Bnys a Dozen aud Xearet
for the South.
R. C. Fate, owner of extensive race
tracks and several f .st horues at tne City
of Mexico, baa been Here for s-everal day a
past and has purchased a carload of race
horses, which be will take to Mexico
with him. There are twelve of the horses
in all. They were picked up of various
owners, and Mr. Pate thinks he has
among them several that will prove very
fast. He has contracted for a car (or tbe
horses with the Southern Pacific Com
pany at a cost of $600. Six men will go
along in a caboose to take care of them.
Mr. Pate with the horses left yesterday
for i he south. He has been stopping at
the Palace 'lurine his stay bere.

Resolutions of Thanks to "The Call"
Adopted at a Meeting of tba
Leagu?.
The echo of the soul-inspiring words
spoken at the recent grand mass-meeting
bela at Metropolitan Temple in favor of
Free Cuba has come back from New York,
and the Cuban League of this Uiiy is pre
paring for more and greater deeds to aid
the struggling patriots in the beleaguered
isle.
The league held a meeting at headqnar
ters last evening, at which a large num
ber of members were present and at
which the following letter from Colonel
Ethan Alien, president of the New York
League, was read :
New York, March 22, 1897.
Mr. Fbust E. Mascherini, Secretary of the Cuban
League, San Â»a>iCfseoâ Dear Sir: Your letters
of die 13th and 14th lasts, are at band, and
we are very much pleased at the progress San
Francisco is making in organizing her division
of the Cuban League of the United Slates
under your leadership aud that oi President
John H. Jones.
Please al-o, iv the name of the cause of not
only Cuban independence, but of human free
dom, thank The Call for the co-operation and
support It is giving.
You have done well in organizing a ladies'
auxiliary. We do hope thai your meeting of
Saturday was a success, and that the telegram
â we sent was read. Yours very truly,
Ethan Allen.
Suggestions for still further aiding the
cause were then discussed and a far-reach
ing plan was laid out and will be put into
force, providing the support and co-oper
ation of other communities can be ob
tained.

Arrest of Two Men at the Track
With Counterfeit Coin in Their
Possession
For some months past a gang of coun
terfeiters have b?en engaged in changing
counterfeit $5 pieces for good money, and,
strange as it may appear, they have dii
posed of the greater part of the bad coins
to pawnbrokers and bookmakers on the
racesâ a class of people expert in the
handling of money and the least likely to
be deceived.
The United States Secret Service De
partment was at first notified Dy a pawn
broker, who was so indignant that he
could hardly speak. Some one had re
deemed a pledge with counterfeit $5
pieces and received some change besides;
but the pawnbroker wa3 so elated on get
ting 10 per cent for two weeks' interest
that he forgot to examine the coins with
the proper degree of care.
Then came complaints from and con
cerning bookmakers at the races. Patrons
brought bad coins and said that they had
received them for their winnings. Book
makers complained that the bad metal
was worked off on them in exchange for
pool tickets. When tbere is a rush for
pools the money is swept hastily into the
cash box without any careful examina
tion whatever. It is paid out in the ?ame

money.
Unned States Secret Service Agent Mick
Harris and his men watched the races
c.osely, and particularly kept under sur
veillance the cashiers of several bookmalt
ing arms and their patrons. Tne book
makers clubbed together and nut up a
purse with which they employed Pinker
ton detectives to watch their patrons in
order to detect the passers of the spurious
coins.
Still the colna came in with amazing
regularity, in some instances gilded nick
els having been passed as five-dollar
pieces in the rush. Tne counterfeit gold
pieces were very poor imitations of the
genuine, b.eing tight, destitute of ring and
with their character plainly apparent to
the eye and to the touch. But as they
were offered to the bookmakers always in
a great hurry they were accepted without
suspicion.
The first indication that the United
States detectives had any proofs as to the
guilty parties or that they were on their
trail was noted yesteroay when Mr. Har

was that of a grand demonstration before
Congress to convince the National iegis
lators luat tliis country ?s thoroughly in
earnest in Its hopes of Cuba's freedom. It
was decided to begin a movement for a
monster petition, the largest ever gath
ered in the United States, and to induce
the eloquent speakers in the House and
Senate to take up the Cuban question in
some form or other on the day the peti
tion :s presented. The leaders here be
lieve that at least 1,000,000 names can be
obtained in this country in a compara
tively short time and that such a demon
stration will have a great eftect on Con
gress.
Nor is the matter to stop here. If other
leagues in this country will join in the
movement the San Francisco division will
send representatives to Washington to
carry its portion of the petition and do
what is possible to urge the Cuoan sym
pathizers in Congress on to victory.
In order to accomplish this great object
the league wili circulate petitions through*
out the State where communities are
known to be in sympathy with the move
ment, and personal letters will be sent to
the Mayors of all towns in California
asking them to push the cause of Cuba
and call mass-mee:ings, where the senti

George Lewison, Mr. Harian's cashier,
was requested by Mr. Harris to appear at
his office this morning to answerquestions.
"He was not arrested," said Mr. Harlan
to a Call reporter last night. "A sum
mons ot arrest was served on him, and ho

"We have bad a good deal of trouble
with those bogus five-dollar pieces," added
Mr. Harlan. "Patrons have offered them
to us lor tickets, and when we refused to
accept them they made a great kick and
said that they got them from the back of
the box in return for winning pool-tickets.
"We have had even girt nickels shoved on
us, and one day I threw several of them
and several bogus live-dohar pieces into
the bay as I was crossing over on the
ferry-boat.
"I always made it a point to destroy
these counterfeit coins whenever I dis
covered that I hud any, but some of them
may have been overlooked and paid out

had come to us with a search warrant and
searched our money box, for then we

Mr. Harlan expressed the hope that the
guilty persons would be apprehended,

two men were arrested on the racetrack
yesterday afternoon with counterfeit coin
in their possession. They were taken
away and sequestered by the secret service

MRS, MARTIN'S RETURN
She Says That the Women oi
California Excel in
Beauty.
Mrs. Isabella Martin, well known in
San Francisco by reason of the celebrated
Martin will contest, has just returned
from New York, where she has apent a
year in studying for the stage.
Mrs. Martin look* young and vigorous
after a long siege of study, and is very
enthusiastic pver her prospects.
"I must first tell you how delicrbted 1
am to return to San Francisco," said Mrs.
Martin last night. "1 felt like a littie girl
with new toys when I knew we were in
California again, for theie was something
delighttul in the sight of oranee blossoms
and ereen things. You know lam an old
New Yorker, bm I tell you San Francisco
is ahead of New York in many things.
"Our women out nere are more beauti
ful and are better dressed than the New
York women- ami that's saying a great
deal. This is not a jay town, but we are
cosmooolitan and can give them all points
in many directions."
Mrs. Martin will remnin hereabout two
mouths, after which she will return East
to fulfill some en aeeruents. Her reper
toire consists of a large number of plays,
but she prefers Lady Macbeth to all
others.
She says she would be delisrhted to play
Agnes Booth's roles, but would rather be
like Charlotte Cushman than like any
other actress she can name.
"It is just possible I may play here yet,"
she said, "lor it is home, and I am "well
known here. I micht "et up a benefit for
Cuba, as 1 did in New York, but this is all
problematical as yet.
"Do you know I consider Irving the
greatest of all actors? I was delighted
with him, and ne sent me box seats for
twenty-two performances while I was
EaÂ«t.
"Hardy is one of thÂ« greatest of living
novelists, and his famous 'Tees of the
d'Urhervilles' is a great success in every
way."
Mrs. Martin met many wealthy business
men while East, and was commissioned
to investigate the merits of a commercial
enterprise of considerable magnitude
while here. This may detain her for
some time.

NEW ERA FOR
SCHOOL TEACHERS
Significance of the Annuity
Fund Bill Just
Signed.
Means the Virtual Financial
Independence of Instructors
for Life.
General Meeting of the Teachers of
the City Called for Friday
Afternooa.
In signing the teachers' annuity fund
bill Governor Budd has earned the grati
tude of nearly every teacher in the State.
Under the new law it is compulsory for
all teachers in San Francisco, appointed
after the passage of the bill, to become a
member of the annuity association, but it
is still left to tne choice of teachers in the
imerior.to join or not.
Each member will be required to con
tribute $1 a month, and having served a
period ol thirty years will be allowed to
retire with an annuity of $600, or $50 a
month. In the interior the annuity will
be $360, or $30 a month. Night-school
tehchers, who-e salaries are much less
than tho?e who teach in the day, will be
required to contribute but 50 cants a
month, and will be entitled to $25 a month
as a pension after thirty veara' service.
It is believed that about ten teacners
now in harness will ask to be retired, and
that their requests will be granted. Most
of them are more than seventy years of
age. About thirty teachers in* this City
are qualified to retire.
Teachers who become disabled before
they have served thirty years will be al
lowed such proportion of the $50 a montti
as the time of their service bears to thirty
years.
In addition to the monthly contribu
tions of i lie teachers, the hind will be aug
mented from the "absence" money of
teacher?. For each day a regular teacher
iails to report for duty he is fined one
twentieth of his month's pay, and half of
this line will go into the annuity fund.
The revenue from this source will be about
$5500 a year. It is also expected that ad
tlitiona will be made to the lund through
legacies and donations.
It is expected that the Denraan medal
fund of $3000 and the Bridge medal fund
of $3000 will be made a part of the annuity
fund, as they are no longer used for their
original purpose, owing to the fact that
the awarding of medals to pupil* engen
dered jealousy and lli-feelinir.
There is now in the fund, which was
started only two years ago, about $6000.
Twenty-five per cent of all receipts are to
be placed in a sinking fund until such
lund reaches $ r >o,ooo. This will be done
to protect the interests of the younger
teachers. Should the available fund for
the payment of annuities be inadequate
to meet demands at any time the avail
able amount will be apportioned pro rata
am. me the annuitants, but such a contre
temps is not anticipated.
AH teachers who retire must pay into
the annuity fund an umount equal in the
aegrecate to the amount that tney would
have contributed in thirty years, namely,
Superintendent Webster yesterday
issued a notice callinz for a general meet

corner of Geary and Scott streets, at
4 o'clock Friday afternoon. At this meet
ing the new law will be explained and
discus ed, and all who desire will be

EDITOR BURGESS
KILLS "THE LARK"
Like the Fabled Swan, It
Dies When Its Note
Is Clearest.
An Odd Journal That Attracted
the Attention of the Lit
erary World.
Its Posters and Verse Wers Fresh
as the Morir.n: and Its Name
Will Livf.
The Lark, which for two years has given
San Francisco fame in literary circles the
world over, will die in its prime with the
April number. It has been condemned by
William Doxey, its publisher, and by
Gelett Buraess, its editor and founder.
"We want it to die like the faoled
swan," said Mr. Doxey yesterday, "just
when its note is clearest. We want it re
membered as it was in the hour of its
greatest strength and beauty.
"So, just at the happiest, sunniest hour,
THE LARK'S LAST POSTER.
when its columns are filled with bright
verse and original drawings, the Lark will
disappear from the sky, leaving memories
that can never die, pictures that will re
turn like visions of sunshine and gold."
Editor Burgess has achieved lame and
attracted the attention of men like W. D.
Howells and tne critics of Harvard.
"Why do you suspend in the midst of
all this encouragement?" he was asked
yesterday.
"Because our mission is ended," he re
plied." It flowed along naturally and was
not forced, but to go further would be
forcing it. The Lark lived because of its
beautiful optimism, being at the same
time a sort of joke in earnest and a protest
against journalism that is merely com
mercial. Almost all of the fads and freaks
are already dead and we are content to go
also, now that the spirit of spontaneity h
over. Our work has attracted great atten
tion and we have received good press
notices and kindly criticisms from men of
note in letters. We can congratulate our
selves that we quit in good repute."
It was the opinion of such men as
Howells that the verse of the Lark, writ
ten largely by Editor Burgess and Bruce
Porter, was of a more serious and meritor
ious character than the mass of what is
printed even in the great magazines.
The part played by W. E. Doxey in the i
success of the Lark was very great. "I
found these young men with matter of !
merit," said he, '"but they did not seem
to know just how to handle it, so I took
ii up and published the Lark first jointly :
with them and then myself. The two
volumes issued are now bound and the
demand for them is large, but we 'lecided
to quit while our name was goou."
Everything about the Lark was odd,
from the queer pap-r to the novelties
printed upon its quaint pages. The motto
at the beading pave a good idea of tho
contents. It ran: "'Who'll be the
clerk?'" "I, 1 said the Lark." And the
prologue to the fir -t oooe runs thus:
A new note â some of the joy of the morn
ingâ>et here for the refreshment of our souls
in the heat of midday.
With no more serious intention than to be
gayâ to sin? a soug, to tell a story; and wtien
this Is no longer to our likingâ when the
spring calls or t lie road invitesâ then this
little nouse oi pleasure will close its door-;
and if you have cared lor oar singing and
would have more of It, then you must follow
us afield.
For, after all, there's your place and oursâ
there you may hear the birds calling, and see
trees blowinc. and know the great conteut of
the earth. Meantime, shut ie tnc tcwn, we
shall blow our nickel pipe, to make you be
lieve It ii a reed, and that you dance, gar
landed, to Us piping.
In the sentence, ''Then this little house
of pleasure will close its door?,'' is the
prophecy of the death of the Lark.
The Boston Transcript, speaking for the
exclusive and literary East, lately said:
"You will wonder how you lived without
the Lar*. It is the most excellent fooling
for many years, and U's better than fool
in?, as all truly excellent fooling must
be?" XT
â¢'Nerea: A Poem of the Shore," in No.
3 of the Lark, attracted wide attention,
and it gives a fine idea of the verse of
Editor Burgesi. It opens:
I could not s:eep; the moon was new, and
from the sea there came a call oi witcheryâ
TaÃue, but irresistible. L'p and away I went;
my feet did with me what they would; I hur
ried on Â«n>l on toward me shore.
And there, amid the shadowy rocks, I found
her, with her lone hiiron her shoulders, and
her white arms bare. Before we met she
spoke with a voice full of strange tones and
mystic cadences, yet as to one she Had been
longiae, hoping for. So to her swift I ran, on
that wild beach, 'neath that wild BKy; and
there I stayed on that first night, as in a
dream.
The weird poem concludes as follows:
Sometimes I reached the starlit shore ere
yet the ebb was spent, and cast myself upon
the silver sand to wait the flood. Then as I
slept would Nerea rise from out the foam aud
steal across the shining floor and wake me
with a kiss. Then, 'mid the links and dunes
beside tue sea, we'd frolic in the witchery of
the great white moon, and hide within the
cup-shaped holes of shifting sand, fringed by
the wiry beach grass, waving In the midnight
breeze; to which remote and secret rooms the
roar of surf came chastened from the shore,
while we reclined upon the sleeping banks of
soft, warm sand, and watched the slow pro
cession of the stars around the pole and
meteors dripping from tne August sky.
The L*rÂ£ posters probably attracted as
much attention as any other feature of the
novel publication, in this department
Flor nee Lundborg achieved a decided
irit. and her work will be remembered.
Mr. Burgess will hereafter devote him
self to literary work, though he is a_ civil
engineer and has been a professor in the
State University.

Warren E. Price, who was convicted
several months ac;o of sending obscene
matter tbroagh the mails, presented him
self at noon yesteiday at the j.-ate of the
San Quentin prison and surrendered him
self to Warden Hale.
Price had been sent to the penitentiary
to serve a sentence of eighteen months

and went East. The Supreme Court af
firmed the judgment of the lower court,
and when the opinion was rendered he
had not yet returned from Washington,
whither he had gone to look after his
appeal.
His absence gave rise to a report that he
had jumped .ais bonds of $5000 rather than
return and serve the remaining fourteen
months of his sentence. His return has
