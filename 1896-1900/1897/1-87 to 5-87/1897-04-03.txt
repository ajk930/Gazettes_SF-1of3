â  . A force of British marines, with guns,

the houses there for provisions, which,
whenever they were found, were destroyed

small mercantile craft that were lying at
that place. . The peasants refused to sur
render the vessels, whereupon the marine*
threatened to destroy the village. Eventu
ally the boats, met e yielded.
The most astounding incident reported,
however, is the following: A British de
tachment which was sent to Kissamo

tain Christians. - Cables wore then .a?

Fiesta de Los Angeles for 1897, the oar- I
nival which . will begin on April . 20 and
continue to the 25th. The great crowd of
Eastern tourists now in Los Angeles
guarantees a larger \ attendance from
abroad than heretofore.
An important question relating to the
Fiesta for this year was settled to-day be
tween tbe executive committee and Victor
Ponet,' whereby the location of .the
tribunes has been decided upon. " Ponet
is the owner of the block of land bounded
by Grand 1 avenue and Twelfth, Hope and
Pico streets. The' committee has leased
this . ground for a period of ' thirteen 1
months, which includes next year's car
nival time as well as ' this. Not the least'
important gain to the public lies in the
probability that the tribunes and other
buildings arranged for fiesta week may be
allowed to remain through the year. This
would * provide : a tine' place for athletic
sports and one; easily reached by many'
car lines. ''* ;' ' ,'" X: ' , _'. V. : 'â ', ' i

then a number of new bets were made on
the duration of the fight. Most of the

â  JACKSONVILLE, III.', April 2.â The
supposed ' suicide of Charles . L. Hastings
has developed into a mysterious murder.
Suspicion points to . Mr. Draper, who was
formerly employed in , the abstract office
of Judge Kirby, where I Hastings wonted.
He says he left on - account of Hastings'
overbearing "ways. - Wednesday night,
when the murder was committed, ; was
dark, and 'stormy* and the street lights
were shut off. \ Draper says he went from
his house early in the evening to his office
to attend to urgent business, and did not
leave until about bedtime, when be went
directly home. The blood stains ' seen on :'
hfs stairs and doorknob is explained by a
cut ! finger which be shows and declares
he cap t .-prove; v his innocence. The most
damaging evidence against him is that
apparently no one else would know how!
to enter "the vaults. A detective had been
employed to watch the office, but he was
relieved because *itt was 'believed * the

WEYLER IN VERY GREAT HASTE
Court - Martial of the Butcher - Captain's |
Friends to Sentence the Prisoner to
. Death Before Our Congress â¢

KEY WEST, Fla., April 2.â lt was said
here to-day on Havana information that
General Rivera's court-martial met yes
terday and that he was then sentenced to
be shot at sunrise to-day.
Passengers on the Olivette said that
there were rumors in Havana to that ef
fect. Henrico Tomao, -a Cuban who was;
on the vessel en route to his home in New :
York, said that he knew positively that
Rivera's fate was but a matter of days or
perhaps hours. He had a friend, a close
confidant of a palace official, who in
formed him in confidence that Weyier ;
was afraid the United States Government
would do something to save Rivera, and
he wanted to forestall such action.
The news of the debate yesterday in the
Senate was cabled to Havana and then
wired to W6yler. It was understood at the j
palace that Weyler intended to arrange
matters so that he would not be balked
agaie. The court-martial was ordered the
moment the news of Rivera's capture was
received, and it was directed to use every
diligence to make its report. â¢*'* "-, '
The sentence of death â¢â  was practically;
pronounced before the court convened. A
form of trial- was ordered in deference to?
public opinion in the United -States,^..The!
names of the officers of the court have not
been made public, it is said, but they were
the most intense partisans that Weyler
has. Xy x, \ " ' ' . 'Â£y>
Several cable inquiries sent over to
Havana this morning have remained
unanswered, and.it is the opinion here
that something has occurred, as the > cen
sor refuses to allow any information about
Rivera to be sent out.

The report is '" cenerally believed in

which they remained in Rivera's* camp

the Spaniards of all the Movements of the

. The commissioners not only submitted
to Rivera the proposed, reforms, with full
authority from Genejal Weyler, but'also
a letter from a Cuban who resides, in
Havana and fought, in'the patriot tanks
during the last, revolution, commending
them to his consideration. Â» To th",s letter,
they owed tbeir lives and the good treat
ment they received from. General Riven.'
Now they are accused by public opinion of
having betrayed him to General Hernan
dez de Velasco.* v. * * -*. * .^V.-v
The accusation is fortified by {he fact
that. Senor Jorrin, .one of . the Spanish
envoys, isa friend of General Hernandez
Velasco, and had several conferences with
him afier his interviews with Rivera. It
is a)Â«o known that Rivera was surprised
by Hernandez de Velasco, the Spanish
irene knowing beforehand the position
and forces of Rivera. . ' Â«
Senor Canovas has made this declara

. "We may consider the revolution con
quered in Cuba. We may say that only
small bands of insurgents are left in the

CHICAGO, 111., April 2.â"There is no
reason from what I have observed why
the Illinois Steel Company should not en- '
gage in manufacturing armor' plate. To
say the least I am highly impressed and j
my anticipation of its equipment and i
facilities have been more than realized.
The rail mill is one of the finest I have ;
ever seen, the Bessemer department- is i
ideal and the open hearth plant is above
-the average." .'â¢<*'
~ Captain W. T. : Sampson; chiefs of the |
Bureau of Ordnance of the United States i
.navy, who came to Chicago to-day to in- S
spect the plant of the Illinois Steel Com
pany with reference to handling contracts
for armor-plate for the new battles- hip?, I
Alabama, Illinois and Wisconsin, thus j
expressed himself tbis evening. It was j
after .a ten hours' examination of the j
â¢works at South Chicago, where it is pro
posed to establish the armor-mills. Vice-
President W. P. Palmer and General Man
ager Walker of the company accompanied
the captain during the day's inspection.
* Bids for the armor plate for these three
battle-ships will be opened in Washington
next Thursday, and on the report of Cap
tain-Sampson hinges the hope of the
Illinois Steel* Company to engage in the
manufacture of armor plate in opposition
to Carnegie and the Bethlehem Company.
.The present indications are believed in
naval circles to be that tbe Illinois Com
pany will be the only bidder on the three
vessels within the maximum of $300 a ton
imposed by law. Hence Secretary Long
deemed it advisable that his ordnance
chief should look over the equipment and
facilities of the Chicago concern. ; ? V'X-'X*
About 8000 tons of armor plate, will be
required for the three ship?, and this,
which would furnish employment- to 400
men, would be the entering wedge to es
tablishing one of the greatest armor-plate
plants of the world. . In the call for pro
posals it is left for the bidder to decide
when the first delivery shall be made, but
it is tacitly understood that it shall be
within a year from the time the contract
is awarded:"/ ; ,
It is Secretary Long's wish to have the
three battle-ships ready in twojyears, yet
it is said the administration looks so
kindly on the endeavor of the Illinois
Company that there will be a disposition
to delay' the ships if the plant cannot
meet the expectation of the Government
as to delivery, thus cutting the coÂ«t of
armor plate almost in half.

immediately, follow an extension of the
blockade to the Greek coast. This fact
cannot be left out of consideration. It is
believed in some quarters that if the Gulf
of Athens is blockaded popular excite
ment will 1 / compel the King to declare
war, even -if his own judgment and that
of the Cabinet were opposed. This has
been a leading cause of the delay in secur
ing a unanimous agreement between the
powers. There is no doubt that in the
event of a Turko-Greek war the interven
tion of the powers would be suspended.
. The Greeks are calculating on the neu
trality of ; the : powers so far as the Greek
fleet is concerned and believe that even if
tbey should suffer reverses on land, which
they do not expect, thty would more than
retrieve themselves by the victories that
their; navy would win. And they confi
dently , believe that :,. the powers would
not allow "a,. Turkish army, to capture
Athens if the worst came.

The correspondent adds j that in inter

seen the proclamation issued by the ad
mirals stating that an autonomous form

only know that the Europeans have used

from Mr. Gladstone, in which tho ex-

The powers, Mr. Gladstone adds, are en-*
titled to claim that whoever shall be se

PARIS, Fra>ce, April 2.â The Dingley
tariff bill now before the American Con
gress has materially excited -American
business houses here. The American
Chamber of Commerce has held a largely

af the bill. Among those present was Mr.

of the mutual trade *of France and the

goods to the value of ; 180,000,000 francs,
while France bad sent into the United
States, duty free, only : 80,000,000 francs'
worth of articles. .
Owing to the reduction of duties to some
countries, not the United States, the
Chamber suggests that the United States
reduce. its tariff on some of tbe most im

then admit many American articles at a
reduced rate. '. VfISIS&I

Treasury Department Officials Arrange to
Carry Out the Retroactive Features
in Ding ley's Bill.
"WASHINGTON, D. C, April 2.â The
Treasury Department thought it would
strike a snag in attempting to carry out
part of tbe retroactive features of the new
tariff bill, but it has found a way out of
tbe difficulty. yX ' 'â â  ',' X/,
Under the last clause of the relroactive
section it is made the duty of the Secretary
of the Treasury to prescribe and enforce
suitable regulations to carry out the pro
visions of the entire section, including the
retention in bonded ' warehouses of the
United States or any other place where
imported goods are deposited, of samples
of such goods until required for evidence
in any trial. Retroactive sections apply
to ' all goods ordered after March 1, and
there .is likely to *be considerable legal
trouble if samples are uot retained until
now. The Dingiey bill not being | a law,
no law exists for compelling the retention
of samples. '1-.
Chairman Dingley bad a talk with , Sec
retary Gage about this matter this morn
ing and that they had found a way out of
the difficulty was shown by the following
â statement, given out later in the day:
"Of course, this provision is not yet a
law, but unless action is taken to retain
samples it will be difficult for the depart
ment, in cases where it is necessary to
have samples of the goods, to determine
the rate of duty to successfully maintain
Its position that the importation was sub
ject to the rates applicable under the so
called Dingley bill. Section 249 of the
Revised Statutes provides that 'the Secre
tary of the Treasury shall direct the su
perintendence of â¢ the , collection of the
duties on imports and tonnage as he
shall judge best.' If a regulation is issued
providing â¢ for ,- the > retention of . samples
upon imports trom and alter April 1 the
regulation mutt ". be . made under ; this
statute, for obviously no action can be
taken by the Treasury Department under
the bill which passed 'the House until it
has also passed the Senate ; and received
approval of the President." Xx : :; . â¢
;â â¢ Secretary Gage has decided . to draft
sections at once requiring the retention of
samples for use as evidence in legal dis
putes 5 between the* Government and im
porters over the _â  assessment of duties.
This may be promulgated to-morrow if
their phraseology can be decided on be
tween to-day and then. As matters stand
the department is in something of a mess
over the retroactive features.'.' The sample'
clause applies* only to duties to assessed
ad valorem, and a perusal of the bill will,
show that the department is con fronted
by complications and ' embarrassments ; in
attempting to carry it out. For instance,
furniture is assessed ad .valorem by the
Dingley bill, and the only way to retain a
sam of a piece of; furniture is by keep
ing the whole thing. This may interfere
in some cases with the carrying out of
contracts calling for the delivery of 'goods
at specified times. Altogether the lot of
the official who has undertaken to draft
the "sample" clause is not enviable.
TOURIST WHEELMEN, READ THIS.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April Tpurists
intending to take their bicycles abroad
the coming summer will shortly be able
to secure from the Department of State a
copy of an exhaustive report just received
from Consul Chancellor at Havre,
France, giving a detailed statement of the
rules and regulations which now' prevail
ia the various European countries regard
ing bicycles and cyclists. Some of the
chief points of interest are briefly as fol
lows: - : â¢ ' yyy'XXx'
Franceâ A deposit of about 25 cents a pound
to cover the import duty- must be made,
which is refunded when the wheel leaves the
country. There is an annual tax of $2 for
every wheel. . Wheels must have bells and lan
terns, and there are strict rules about riding.
Bicycles go as baggage on railways.
Germany The duly is 3 cents a pound, but
no deposit is required. - - !
In Austria a deposit of $10 must be made.
â  In -Belgium 12 per cent ad valorem duty
must be deposited, members of touring clubs
oi France being exempt. .. ... â â¢ '..
Denmark requires 10 per cent deposit and
Egypt '8 per cent, ai.d in all cases it Is essen
tial to preserve the receipt for deposit.
England charges no duty.
'Italy compels a deposit to guarantee
against the sale of the bicycle, exempting,
however, the French Touriug Club, which is a
good * organization to join,- apparently, as it
only costs $1 a year and embraces as many ad
vantages in Europe as the League of American
Wheelmen does in this country. - .' - .
In nearly all the remaining conntries
deposits are required and in Spain a six
months' license, costing 20 cents is re
quired.. ...*"â â  . .'â¢ 4 |
.Consul Chancellor points out that mem
bership in bicycling organization abroad,
as at home, carries great advantages, re
duced hotel rates and repairs and cour
teous treatment generally.

ST. LOUIS, Mo., April 2.â The river at
this point has made a new record. Within
thirty-six houra.it bas risen 4.7 and is still
upward hound, the eauge at 6 o'clock:, this
evening marking 28.7 feet. This* is only
2.3 leet below the bieh water of 1593, which
.was so disastrous. Profiting by ; the dire
experience of that flood, the people of
East St. Louis bave raised the levees and
the railroads have built up their road beds.
Merchants along the shipping front, have
begun to -.move their stocks to higher
ground." The lumber district north of the
Lads bridge is exposed, and should the
.record gauge of thirty feet be reached
there, the loss would be very heavy. Trains
are running irregularly. The St. Louis
.and San Francisco had, up to to-night; the
only track -that gave "Western, roads an
inlet here.' .'â¢-'*
. ST. PAUL, Minx., April The flood in
this region and other Mississippi- points
in the State and in South Dakota remains
serious.- The Water rose, .here .'to-day,
â¢showing 2.4 feet above the danger line.
Mr. Huddl."son of'Prescott was drowned
.this morning while trying to cross the â¢
"South St*. Paul Belt. Line bridge. Trains
.are delayed and one or two have not been
heard -from. Wagon bridges are down
and dams have gone out, letting great
deluges into the big river.
â¢ The river is still rising at Huron," S. D.,
. a heavy.- rain having fallen during the
â¢ night. , The Great -Northern Railway
bridge is in danger, and no attempt is be-,
ing made to move-trains on the north and
west lines of the. Northwestern road.
*:' ALTON. 111., April 2.'â The Govern
ment" forecast officials at St. -Louis wired
here to-day that a disastrous flood stage
will be reached by Sunday. The river has
â¢ already risen. to twenty feet- above low-
Water mark, the highest point touched for
'five years, and this intelligence caused a
mild panic among those who have hoped
â¢ for relief. The lower levees in St. Charles

the river levee until they rise high enough J
to break over the second or railroad levee, j
when they. pour through into the next pool |
and so on.
-The various culverts and other openings |
in these embankments are entirely inade
quate to carry off' even a small fraction of
the vast volume of water which a crevasse j
in the river levee will furnish,' and so in- I
stead of being allowed to follow its natural
course and spreading gradually over the
whole country keep the depth below tbe
point of danger and destruction it is con
fined to a limited area for the time, until it
is entirely drowned out and then passes
on to do the same thing over again. This
multiplication of crevasses* and the ac
companying rush of the huge masses of
water largely"muttiply the damage and
destruction they cause at places least pre
pared; and everything in front is doomed,

would be. The banks as -fiist constructed
have been gradually raised until now they
in many places are higher and- stronger
than the river levees themselves and in
sure the worst to the unfortunate district
which they enclose. When a break does
come, granted the ' present high water
continues any time, as it seems now cer
tain to do, the whole strip of country
from Friars Point to Vicksburg between

gle, ior office in Santa Fe, San Miguel,
Mora and several other, counties has been
carried on for years through the medium
of secret political ;. societies, composed
mostly of ignorant natives, having the
moral support and backing at . least of a
certain class of American residents, whose
craving, or official, power -and- patronage
was far greater than their regard for the
public weal or their love for their adopted
home.
Out of this condition' of things grew the
reign of terror and | bloodshed which cul
minates, in the execution of a righteous
judgment of the courts, whicn is hailed
far and wide as a victory for law and
order. mfmfti W&
"In 1891 these political methods brought
about the organization of many so-callsd
Knights of Labor lodge*;, supported only
by ' Democrats, and Republican; League
societies backed up by the: Americans
who; affiliated with that pany. Ma ny
crimes were directly traceab.e to these or
ganizations. In San Miguel County, of
which Las Vegas is the county seat, the
Democrats held , sway and there the
Knights of Labor flourished and did as
they pleased, regardless of law. In Santa
Fe County the Republican League of Mu
tual Protection, commonly known as the
"Button lane," did likewise. â¢ .
Frank Chavez was Sheriff, Democratic
boss, and 'a, fearless and unscrupulous
leo.der in Santa Fe, and his influence was
such as to make bim a formidable and
dangerous political foe. The executive
committee of the Button. gang met in
secret and resolved that Cnavez should be
shorn of his power, even if he had to be re
moved by .death." Others .who were
Chavez's friends and supporters were also
placed under espionage by this secret so
ciety. The ;." Borrego .â  brothers: their
brother-in-law, Lauriario Aland; Hipolito
Vigil, an aspiring politician; Patricio Va
lencia, whose ambition it was tv serve as
town constable; Juan Galleeos, Frank
Rivera and others of . the Button gang
vera and others of the Button gang
were designated a committee with. power
to do as they pleased for the promotion of
the good of the cause. -
â Frank ; Borrego bad been defeated for
the office of Coroner and Chief of '.."Police
by Sylvester Gallegos. the personal: friend
of Sheriff Chavez. , In a street tight, one
nigbt Borrego shot and killed Gallegos.
Sheriff Chavez placed Borrego in irons in
tne county jail and assaulted him while
he was handcuffed. j Lawyer T. B. Catron,
now Delegate in Congress, as attorney for
Borrego, obtained .bis release from jail on
bonds. Fanstin Ortiz, a roundabout town
character, was affiliated with the Borregos
and Alarids in their political aspirations,
and one night be disappeared. His; body
was found in a sandy ravine near town
thirty .days Hater. The Borregos claimed
tbat certain Democrats* had killed Ortiz,
and accused Sheriff Chavez of -" shielding
them. "X- ,-. â  X- ... .". , . â :.. ;"â¢>-:'/<â¢;;
X. One the night of si May 29. 1892, Frank
Chavez, who had lost his office as Sheriff

Still no one dared to talk. * The Button
gang had full sway, certain officials were
its members; and Chavez's friends, and
other Democrats found it convenient to
remain indoors after nightfall. *'â¢ 5 "' ':'
One man, however, did soma talking.
He was ex-Sheriff Chavez's jailer, Juan
Pablo Domtnguez by name. Thirty days
after Chavez's . assassination the Borrego
brothers and Alarid met him at dusk in

Juan Pablo bit "the' dust,' shot by rrank
Borrego.
:. In : May, 1893, Governor W. T. Thornton
became the chief executive of New Mexi
co and in thirty days be had- detectives at
work, both in San -Miguel and Santa Fe
counties. The white-cap eang was broken
up, several of them wtra publicly executed
and thirty-seven members thereof are
now serving various sentences in the peni
tentiary. In Santa Fe County cause was
found for the removal -from office of tbe
District Attorney and Sheriff Conklin,
who were succeeded by District Attorney
J. H. Crist and Sheriff W. P. Cunningham,
a fearless Texan, and before many weeks
the law officers 'bad secured statements
. from Juan Gallegos, Frank Rivera, Luis
Gonzales and other former members of the
Button gang, who bad previously been
afraid to talk, and the Sheriff's office was
notified by tbe Governor to arrest the
chief- conspirators.
Hipolito Vigil resisted * arrest and was
shot and killed by Chief Deputy Sheriff
Thomas Tucker; Frank Borrego, Lauri
ano Alarid and Patricio Valencia were
soon behind the bars, and Antonio Bor
rego made a brave stand in one corner of
his family bedroom, but surrendered while
the officers were preparing to dynamite
the bouse. , *Xy
District Judge E. P. Seeds was on the
bench' at the preliminary trial and
promptly committed the accused without
bail. Tne formal trial took place in April.
1895. The case was appealed on writ of
error to the Territorial Supreme Court by
the attorney* for the accused. Pending
this appeal voluntary confessions of the
crime were made by Alarid and Valencia,
but the case went on, and finally, in De
cember last, was passed .upon by the
United States Supreme Court, which de
cided the action of .the Territorial courts
regular in all respects.

ACQUIRES A SAN JOSE ESTATE.
Miss Emma Ax ford Rewarded for K-nd-
ness to *an Eccentric
Old Kan.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. April 2.â An order was
made by Judge land this morning giv
ing to Miss Emma Axford the estate of G.
T. Schenck,* an eccentric old man, who
died in this city about three years ago.
The estate has been contested in the courts
for the last two years.
Schenck bad been possessed of some j
wealth and he made a will bequeathing
his property to Miss Axford, who had
shown him many kindnesses. At that
time he resided in a cabin on Park avenue,
near .Live Oak Park, . but shortly beiore
his death he went to reside with A. A.
Geer and wife. Just before his death he
gave Geer several thousand dollars' worth
of stocks, mortgages and jewelry. Public
Administrator Secord began an investiga
tion and succeeded in locating about $1200
worth of property belonging to Scnenck
and the will devising it to Miss Axford.
When the estate was about to be dis
tributed, a claimant appeared in the per
son of Caroline Sehencb, an inmate of the
Agnews Insane Asylum. It. was said the
young woman was a daughter of Schenck,
but the evidence to establish the claim'
was lacking, and -some sort of a compro
mise was made.
The estate is valhed 'at about $1200, but
there are evidences that Schenck was in
terested in valuable mines in Mexico, and
' heir to a rich estate in Germany, and it it
believed that more property will be un
earthed.
MRS. SARDS' VICTORY.
Decision in Favor of the Contestant of
Amanda Ellis' Wilt.
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 2.â Mrs. Kate P.
Sands, tbe adopted daughter of the late
Charles and Amanda Ellis of Los Gatos
and the contestant of the will of Amanda
Ellis, got a decision in her favor this aft
ernoon from Judge Kittredge, who ruled
that she was entitled to letters of admin
istration with. the will annexed upon the
estate of Charles Ellis.
In this will Mrs. Sands was left $10 and
by the will of Mrs. Ellis, who was the
principal legatee of Charles Ellis, Mrs.
Sands is made the principal legatee of the
estate, which is* valued at $2500. The
Public Administrator tried to get control
of the estate but failed. -
The victory for Mrs. Sands is counted
as much in her favor in cases to follow, as
two brothers and a sister of Charles Ellis
in Pennsylvania are supporting the Pub
lic Administrator in his fight.

Misunderstanding Arising Over
a Supposed Joke Causes
Trouble. %
The Social Leader Swears Out a
Warrant lor N the Arrest of
the Fo'.itician.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 2.â Social cir
cles are agog to-night over tbe story which I
came out to-day in which Frank H. Gould |
aud Frank Adamsâ the latter a society,
leader â figure as participants in a fight
that took place last night. Adams this
afternoon swore out a warrant for the ar- j
rest of Gould on a charge of battery.
According to Mr. Adams' statements to .
Prosecuting Attorney Rhodes he was sit- I
ting reading a paper in the Yosemite j
Club rooms last night when some one |
struck him on the side of the jaw, knock
ing him from his chair. This blow was |
followed by others and he was dazed. His j
eyes were blackened and there was an '
abrasion on his face. The man wbo made
the unexpected assault was Frank Gould,
tbe former chairman - of the Democratic
State Central Committee. He said after
\ ward to Mr. Adams: ,-.".:.':
"If you want to know what this is for
ask Mr. Naher." -m;y XmXy : X\.t\
The cause -. was this: Just after the
Naher party at the Imperial Hotel Adams j
was chatting with a number of persons I
and there was considerable joking about j
one . thing and , another and one lady re
marked: . -. -. j Xv.i xXxiXmx'mxm
'On, wasn't it too bad about the runa- j
way. " Adams had heard of no runaway
and imagined that it was an April fool
"josh." He decided to see the joke and
go it one better, so he said it was really
too bad, and then went on to give some
harrowing details of what he supposed
was a mythical runaway. He said there
was a lady in the hack, and that she
screamed and the horses look fright and
she was thrown out. 'fm.'-jy
It chanced tbat there really was a runa
way and that Gould was in the conveyance
; with some lady. Tbe remarks made by
j Adams sounded rather peculiar, and upon
' .ascertaining that there was really a runa
i way he went to the persons with whom
! he had been, joking and explained matters.
Gould evidently did not hear about the
| remark until yesterday, when* it was re-
I peated to him, presumably by Mr. Naher.
; Without stopvng for an explanation he
! assaulted Adams on sight. * â¢

construction of the Santa Rosa and Sono
ma County Electric Railway. - The lead
ing bankers, lawyers and business men of
this city were in attendance, and ail de
clared in favor of the speedy construction
of the road.
Colonel Stone, the president of the new
corpora-ion, delivered an address showing
the progress of the enterprise. He said
that the promoters of the road were | not
asking for donations, but 'simply, wanted
a guarantee of patronage sufficient to pay
Interest on tbe bonds issued for two
years. N. W. Grixw.ald of Kenwood, one
of the new line's most active promoters,
also -spoke 'on the road's progress. He
stated that 250 of Sonoma's forÂ«-most citi
zens had agreed .to patronize the road to
the extent of $5 per month during the
first two years, and that it would be ne
cessary that 650 subscribers be obtained
before commencing active b aiding. It
was the opinion of all those present that
the request was reasonable and one easily
complied with, and a committee, consist
ing of W. D. Reynolds,, B. M. Spencer and
W. F. Russell, was appointed to look after
tbe matter. X-^'X '-"XX "â '.,

master-Genera; Gray has issued a "fraud
-order" against Ben' Wiaton of this city
for using the mails tQ advertise the sale of
leaded dice and various other gambling
devices. Some, time ago-Postal Inspector
Flint received a letter from a merchant in
â¢Cripple Creek, Colo., â¢in which was in
closed, an advertising circular, sent out
from Los Angeles by Winton. He offered
tb sell electriclsed arid all kinds- of loaded
dice on reasonable terms. â¢ He gave bis
address as the Hotel Nadeau. Inspector
F^int consulted: with the United States
Attorney and learned that there was no
iaw. under which Winton could be prose
cuted.
A talk with' Chief of Police Glass de
veloped the fact tbat the city authorities
were likewise powerless to deal with the,
agent of swindling apparatus, so. the only
thing/left for Flint to do was to report tbe
master to the head of the department at
Washington.
-â¢By 'the fraud order "issued against Win
ton he is deprived of receiving any mail
matter addressed to him under that name,
so if he desires to sell his good.* he will
have to adopt an alias. The Supreme

to refuse to issue mail to any persons

I you will find that is also true. Joy's Veg-

I know this after the second day.
Then the tbree'good reasons for yon to
take the native remedy are that it la vege-

Joy's see that yon get Joy's; don't allow
any one to persuade you to take other than
the native remedy. There are still a few

they don't want the native remedy to suc-

What the Public at Large Think of'
a Special Remedy Treatment.
Is It the Great Rejuvenator
at Last?
- All the different schools of doctors bare
their specialist*. Just now many*of theÂ«e
specialists . are devoting themselves to
nerve li/e and nerve cures. Special . cares
for nervous disorders are constantly com- .
me to the public view. Many of these
nerve cures and re jtrvena tors seem to hare
their day, and may 1 really be likened .to
fads, for *.ike lads they give way to some,,
other nerve cure â just as certain- to oase
man manly as the previous cure. '-."/._
iJ'rown-Sequara, the. Parisian . savant,
made the 'world (including Rome) howl
els praises. He discovered 3 great rejn- '
venator, .but this -great rejavenator soon
gave war to sometbing'jusi as great, and . ,
now , no' one thinks oi takinjtÃrowD-Se-.. .
-guard's mixture. That this .condition"
should exist in medicine as it does in
nearly every field of endeavor 'seems to
snow the tact' that man is a changeable
being and most have bis fads and fancies. .
Kan' Francisco boasts of a singular, dis-
covery for man. and by. the , showing of
the doctors of Hudson medical fame, this
remedy- treatment is wonderful.-' Over
10,000 persons have used the great Hud-
yau remedy-treatment; most of these peo-
ple live on the Pacific Coast, though not a
lew hail trom the ".Central and Southern
States. . The remedy-treatment Hudyan
is not a "cure-ail' and is not sold in drug-
stores. No one. can get Hudyab unless â 
they apply directly to the* doctors* who
"discovered'it. "It is carefully , prepared
for each and every individual and must
be carefully taken to get good- results."
This is what the chief doctor told me
when I visited his office* at the junction
of Stockton, Market and Ellis streets.' He .
told me that Hudran w^as 'especially effi-
cacious in case o; .Nervous Debility, where
the tissue '-was wa*:ee, shrunken or unde-
veloped. Persons wno have abused them-
selves by drink, dissipation, etc.- soon and
a body weak and wearj and being always
tired they soon realize their condition.
It is those wasting disorders for which
Hudyan was first u.-edand the success at-
tained has been certainly fair. TheÂ«doc-
tor allowed me to walk through His testi-
monial department, and be pulled out the
big files of testimonials saying, "You may â¢
select a few of these, as we have' special
permission to puolish these at which you
are now looking." ' Here is a letter ; froiu -

I . The largest crowd that has yet-attended
I the bicycle races .assembled at the Pavilion
last night. The racing was good, the : heats
land finals in ever/ instance being fought
gout right to. the tape. .-â¢ " '.':*:
The match." races between .Charles S.
| Wells and Walter F. Foster, at one, three'
i and five miles, were the principal features
of the evening's programme. â ' â¢
I .The first, at one mile, was paced for si***'
(laps by "Morris of Texas, at a lively clip.
Wells was first. behind the -pacer, all â¢ the
way, â¢ but after the pacer dropped out
I way, but the lead and held dropped 'lap,.
Foster pot the lead and held U for a lap,
| when Wells: started his sprint and rode
I clear around his opponent, taking the lead
I and maintaining it to tbe tape. Foster
I tried hard to win,- and was only beaten a
I few inches.. The lime was 2:10 2-5. â¢
When the men came out for the two
| mile event, after a short rest, the excite-'
I ment was intense, each man seemingly
Â£ having an equal number of partisans.
I Morris paced *the first mile in 2:29 4-5
| and was relieved by Sullivan for the fir3t
i six laps of the second mile, when be
! dropped out and left the men to them-
I selves. Wells bad the lead and started
I the sprint early, with foster trailing right
I behind him. Foster tried to get to the
I front on the last lap, but tbe big Bay City
| rider had the. race well in hand and won
I all tbe way in 4:45 2:5. He was given a
;â ' great reception as he dismounted. .
Having won two out of the three heats
I Wells was given' (he purse and the match,
I but it. was decided to also run the five-
I mile event to decide Which was the better
I man at that distance.* -
Morris. and Sullivan on a tandem were
| put in to pace the .men, and Foster was
x off me quiCKer and caught first place,
|- Wells closely, following. The tandem
f took them along at 2:15 clip, the 'first
I mile being ridden in that time, two miles
I in 4:30 2-5, three in 6:46 4-5, and four in
9:05 flat.
Â£ The tandem then began to gradually in-
I crease its pace on the last mile, up to the
â  nfth lap, when it dropped out. . Wells im-
I mediately jumped out and soon had. the
I lead, and then commenced a great sprint
| for. the tape. Try as he would, Foster
I could not overtake him, and Wells crossed,"
f. the line first by a lead of a full wheel's
I length. The time was 11:16.
$ The professional open event of the even-
I ing was at one mile", in five heats, two
semi-finals and a final. Allen, Stevens;.
I Jones and Bob Terrill qualified for the
first semi-finaL Allen took the lead early
| and tried to make a runaway race of it,
but was soon overhauled' by Jones, who
won out, Alien running second.
jf â¢â¢;' Becker, Eaton and McFarland rode tho
jSeecond* semi-final. Eaton jumped to the
I â  â  >iit on the sixth lap and started bis fa
fÂ»Vuous'long sprint, which landed him a
I winner, close pressed by McFarland. â¢ ''
This brought Jones, Allen, Eaton and
McFarland into the final. Jones set the
I pace for the first lap, McFarland' for the
I 'second and Eaton for the third. The
1 sprint commenced early, Allen starting
I it. but McFariand soon passed him, and
then Jones- and Eaton. These three
I lought it out to the wire, finishing in that
E order,, inches apart. *
I Two "ordinary" races on the old-style

DISCUSSED BILL NO. 63.
The Teachers' Annuity Assccia
t on Hold a Meeting at the
:"" Girls' H gh School.
A Ratification Meeting to Bs Held en
Tuesday, April 20, at ths
Sam* Place.
. A meeting of the teachers was held yes
terday at the Girls' High School to dis
cuss Assembly bill No. 03, an act to amend
the act to create and administer a teach
ers' annuity and retirement fund in the
several counties and cities and counties in
the State.
Superintendent of Public Schools R. H.
Webster presided. In bis introductory
remarks he said : "We are here to-day to
discuss the Assembly bill No. 63, approved
by the Governor of our State, Mo nday.
.March 29. After much patient work and
waiting, your efforts bave been crowned
with success." In a general review of the
bill mention was made of the 1893 and 1895
committees, who did such excellent work.
Mr. Webster then said: "We must thank
the 1897 committee, whose work has re
sulted in the act you have now before you.
Thanks are also due to our honored
Mayor, James D. Phelan, and the Board
of Education." '
The lollowing letters to the Governor
from Mr. Phelan and the Board of Educa
tion were then read: â¢ â  â¢ â 
â¢:..':..**.: -- March 27. 1897.
Hon; James H. Btidd. Governor of California,
Sacramento. CaLâ Dear Sir: 1 d.sire to call
your iavorable attention to Assembly bill
63, providing for a public schoolteachers'an
nuity and retirement fund. Its â¢ bject is to
pension teachers, the teachers themselves con
tributing $1 a month from their salaries, and
in the City and County of San Francisco it
Is made obligatory on the Board oi Education
to apportion one.half of the hues imposed up
on teachers for non-attendance to their duties
to this fund. This sum amounted last rear to
$11,000 I am informed, and some $5600 of
that amount would have to be apportioned.
II this Item does not Increase materially and if
there be no attempt on the part of the teach
ersâwhich I cannot seriously contemplateâ to
conspire to increase this fund, I think the act
is a wise one.
I do hot think the citizens of San Francisco
would object to the small payment of $5000
or $10,000 out of the fines which would swell
the school, fund itself for the purpose ot en
couraging the teachers, the greater number of
whom are women, to establish an annuity and
pension fund lor their benefit after years of
service. Hence I would respectfully request
you to give your approval to the bill.

siasm, cast 712 votes in favor of the bill and 42
votes against it.
it yie.ds us much satisfaction to be able to
announce this practically unanimous vote in

further recognition of the principle and pol
icy for which we believe we are justly con
tending. ....,,'.
In behalf of the teachers and the members
of tbe Board of Education of this common
wealth we earnestly petition that you approve
and sign this bill, and thus confirm ami es
tablish a just legislation- in the interest of
tnat body of public servants whose lives are

DOBBERTIN'S
"KNOCKED OUT."
A Realistic Bust of Corbett
on the Style of the Dy
ing Gladiator.
The Idea Which the Sculptor Got
of the Carson Episode Por
trayed in -- Clay.
A Look ot Unutterable Agony and Dis*
coaragementâ Making a Bast of
Fred Hinckley- '-'.
- -/ *â  . ' s
Otto Dobbertin has just completed a
bust cf James J. Corbett which is destined
to attract a great deal of attention. The
bust is entitled "Knocked Out," and is
something after' the style ol the "Dying
Gladiator." It represents * the former
champion of the world . jnst alter Robert
Fitzsimmons has dealt. him his famous
book blow on tbe left side near the i.cart.
The tall form of the erstwhile cham
pion is toppling for a collapse. His left |

on the Erstwhile Champion.
band is thrown upward and outward; his
right is at his side; his knees have given
way under him, and his bead is thrown
back, while a look of utter agony comes
over him. The look is painâ of regretful
resignation and surprise. .Moreover, there
is an expression such as Napoleon might
have worn at Waterloo or St. Helena.' It
is of ntter discouragement.
Mr. Dobbertin got his idea of the knock
out both from the papers and from eye
witnesses who graphically portrayed by
word of mouth the effects of the terrible
hook blow of Fiiz-iimmons.
The sculptor was vividly impressed by
.what he heard of the defeat of the Hayes
Valley champion. It reminded him. be
says, of the forceful representation of the
dying gladiator by Story, but he saw in
"knocked Out" more than this, and he lost
no time in getting to work on the idea.
The result is ihat he has a magnificent
bust of the famous hero of the fistic arena.
Some touches need to be added, as for in
stance, the hair is not completely pompa
doured and some other points require a
little changing perhaps, but generally the
idea is well. executed. Tbe statue is not
life size. It is small, but full of force.
William Keith thinks it a very fine thine.
Quite a number of people who have
dropped into the sculptor's studio an\
observed the bust of tbe fallen champion
have been struck with the merit.
Among other things which Mr. Dobber
tin is working on is a . lifesize bust of the
late Fred Hinckley, husband of Florence
Blythe Hinckley. It is being made by
aid of a death masque and photographs.
Mr. Dohb-rtindid not personally know Mr.
Hinckley. Friends of Mr. Hinckley are
pleased with the bust. X'

The fund for the double, purpose of
giving employment to the needy and of
building the grand boulevard has taken on
an active pace, and nearly a thousand
dollars has been added to tbe total.; Sur
veyor of the Port W. D. English added
$500 to the fund as the result of a subscrip
tion of one day's salary, made by the men
in his department. / ..
The various offices at the City. Hall are
also taking much interest in the unem
ployed and the boulevard that is taking
the men out of that category, and; several
funds have been started with a promise of
liberal contiihuiions. i.
The -Fire-Department turned $605 over
to the Mayor Thursday as a.- result of sev

and the Assessor's office followed with
$149, of wbic . $100 was contributed by

off last evening. '.' Some 668 men were
given employment yesterday, but even
that large number was more than covered

the continued activity of the collectors,
however. Â
The applications for work are continu

the men whose brief time has expired,
and who are expected to give place to
some others, plead so piteously for an ex
tension of their time, for a few more days'
work, that it becomes a most difficult
thing for the committeemen to say no.
The men are stretched out over two

"I bave been at many pig-stickings and
have also, at times, been unpleasantly
close to wild tigers of the jungles, when
elephants were being used in the hunt,"
said Mrs. A. Kingman of India to a Call
representative at the Russ.
-'Mrs. Kingman is a great traveler and
has been several times around tbe world.
Last year she was in Egypt for several
months, and since then she has been at
Calcutta, Simla and at different places on
the Ganges. While in India she caught
the jungle fever, and has not been well
since. This is why she has come to San
Francisco, from which she has been away
about nine years. i
'"When I was in India I greatly en
joyed the pig-sticking, but I was a little
afraid of the tiger-hunting. The hunting
for tigers is done on elephants, and if
tbey are not well broken there is danger
of them turning and runnine â stamped
ing, as it were." lf they do this there is
great danger of being killed. Take these
elephants when they get excited and they
willdash off into the jungle rellmell.
Under such circumstances there is little
hope of escaping death.
"I rememoer once that on a hunt of
this sort where elephants were used some
thirty or forty tigers were killed, but the
women always hesitated to go unless they
knew the elerhants were well trained.
"Now, with pig-sticking it is different.,
You can mount your horse and with spear
in band are quite safe though you do at
times encounter some very ferocious ani
mals. I recall that a very fine horse was
on one occasion cut by the tusks of one' of
the wild pigs so that be had to be killed.
Every one regretted the horse's death, be
cause he was such a valuable animal.
Of those wild pigs only the males will
fight. The others cannot be goaded to do
so unless their young are in danger of
being molested; Then they will fight to
beat anything in the world. 'â 
"As for the males they will fight all the
time. They are tenacious as bulldogs and
equipped with their sharp incisors and
their terrible tusks they can rip and tear
in a way tbat is irightlul.
"It is exhilarating in the highest degree
to get on a good pony and, equipped with
a long, sharp spear, go after these ani
mals. In goed bunting ground it takes
no. time at ail to eet a half dozen or a
dozen around you. Then there is fun, but
it is dangerous fun and you must look out.
Should they snap a tendon of your pony's
leg down be will go, and then they will all
make a rush for you. Â°
"It was under circumstances of this
kind that I bunted tbe wild pigs in India.
I always, however, went in company with
others, and generally some ot the officers
from British stations were along. They
are all, as a rule, fine pig-stickers, as are
the women folks ot their . families. We
bad an immense amount of amusement
out of it."
Having the jungle fever Mrs. Kingman
will remain in California for aooui a year.
She thinks of going to one of the local
hospitals for a time.'
THEY ALL FEEL EASIER
Supreme Court D?cisicn M.iy
. B: a Blessing in Disguise to
Railroad Men.
All Danger of a Rate War Is New
Biiicved to Have
- Passed
Railroad men in this City see light
ahead and safe sailing out of the sea of
trouble created by the recent decision of
the Supreme Court of the United States
holding all pooling and rate-making
arrangements to be illegal. They hope to
find relief in the bill introduced by Senator
Foraker of Ohio on Tuesday.
Ever since the decision in question was
given to tbe public there have been alarm
ing rumors of a great rate war involving
every railroad competing for interstate
traffic. ';,y- : .
There was a general disintegration of
the .powerful: organizations of the rail
carriers of the country that gave rise to
fears of rate slashing; on a scale never
before recorded. The disorganization
apparently meant that each individual
railroad company would enter the field for
all the business it could secure, regardless'
of the pre-existing traffic and rate arrange
ments with other roads, and that as a
natural conequence rates- would be cut
right and left. â  Xs&&%ggS&
In the inner circles ' of the railroad
world no such immediate result, how
ever,' was anticipated, as was stated in
The Cam.. According to the statement of
a prominent official of the Southern Paci
fic Company there were two strong rea
sons why rate-cutting would not .be in
dulged in. 'â¢'-
One, of these, he stated, was the fact
tbat rates were now as low as they could
be made and return any. profit. Another
was that rate- cutting, if indulged in
at ; all, to benefit >'â  the road such a
means of securing business would have
to be one in secret and in violation of
the interstate commerce law. ;
Events have proved the correctness of
the views of this gentleman, as little or no
rate-cutting has been reported.
','; Senator >, Foraker's -measure, which is
evidently, designed to restore order out of
the chaos into which railroad matters
were thrown by the decision of .the Su
preme Court, is believed to have the ap
proval of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission, y . , _ yym
It permits railroad, pooling under cer
tain conditions. Railroad companies are
permitted . to enter into pooling agree
ments provided that such agreements are
in writing and are filed with the commis
sion created by tbe proposed act and fare
approved by. such commissi. The com
mission' is given authority to revise or
modify the rates established .if investiga
tion proves such modification 13 necessary.
The orders and findings of the commission
are made subject to review by any Circuit
Court of the United States, and appeal
may be taken to tbe United States Su
preme Court. â¢â  Three days'; notice must be
given for advances and ten days for reduc
tions. 1 ..*â - :
. It is further made lawful for common
carriers to enter into agreements not for
bidden by the fifth section of the inter
state commerce act, in regard to the mak
ing and maintaining of lawful rates - pub

by the Supreme Court decision.
instructions have been issued to the
Ea-tern representatives of the Southern
Pacific Company to withdraw from all as

much as a result of the Supreme Court
decision as because so many roads had al
ready withdrawn and so made the associa
tion virtually useless.''
tome fears have been expressed that the
decision which has caused so much unrest
and uncertainty would affect the special
rates announced for the Christian En
deavor convention to te held in this City.
General Passenger Agent Goodman states.
however, that he believes all- the roads
will abide by the promises they | made at
the time the rates were announced, and
that tbe rate of $50 from Chicago for the
round trip will hold.
; Unless Congress passes the anti-scalpers'
bill, which has already passed the House,
the Southern Pacific Company will refuse
to make State rates for either the Chris

. The members of the Chamber of Com
merce have for some time; past -observed
that the army and navy officers who have ,
the purchasing of supplies for these de
partments of the Federal Government on
this coast Jjave always sent their orders
for supplies to Eastern firms.
; In . fact these officers have completely
ignored the Pacific Coast dealers And
treated San Francisco in particular as
though it. wat a provincial town. .This
has been particularly marked, in the pur
chase of drugs, not a single order having
been placed in ; San Francisco within the
! memory of the members of the chamber. '
â  These gentlemen have decided that the
army and navy officers have "\ ignored - the
Western > firms , long -; enough, and , steps
have been taken to bring about a change
for the' benefit of San Francisco. Within
the past week many letters have been

The revenues of the Government for
March exceeded the expenditures by over
19, 000,000. It was the rush of importa

to the Dingley bill rather than to the

A SURPLUS AT LAST.
Treasury reports for March show that
the receipts of the Government were
$9,004,000 in excess of the expenditures for
the month, and thus the Wilson tariff has
apparently shown itself sufficient for once
to meet the requirements of the Govern
ment and to provide a revenue equal to
current expenses.
It is only in appearance, however, that
this condition exists. The excess of reve
nues is due to the large importations
brought into the country for the purpose
of forestalling the D.ngley tariff, whose
establishment cannot be much longer de
layed. Had it not been for this rush on
th'epartof importers the reports for March
would have shown a deficit as usual, and
the country would have been a little fur
ther in debt than, it was at the beginning
of the month.
* According to reports from New York as
soon, as the importers heard that the
Dingley - tariff was to go into effect from
April 1 they acted promptly to obtain the
benefits of the lower duties under the :
.Wilson law. In one day at the New York
Custom-house the receipts amounted to
$1,726,453, and of this the sum of $1,268,232
repressnted duties on goods withdrawn
from bond, leaving the amount of duties
on direct importations at $453,230.
The receipts at the New York Custom
house foriMirch amounted to a total of
$17,579,633" They w-re exceeded in any
one month only once before in the history
of the Government, which occurred in
1872, just (era 10 per cent reduction in the
tariff.*. It will be seen.' therefore, that the
sole reason why there is a surplus of reve
nue .this 'month -is the consciousness on
the part of the importers that the new
tariff is near at hand.
It is a .question whether the clause of
the Dingley bill putting the new tariff
into effect on April 1 will be sustained by
tfie S nate, or if so sustained would be
upheld by the courts. This question, how
ever, does not affect tb* action of the im
porters to any great extent. They are
taking no Chances. They have brought
.their goods into tbe country, have taken
them out of bond* at once and paid the
customs duties. Thus does the Wilson
bill in its closing days steal a surplus from
the Dingley bill and make a showing for
itself which is not widely dissimilar from
obtaining credit under false pretenses.
CULTURE AND KNOWLEDGE.
. If the object of President "Harper of
Chicago University in getting the Count
ess of Aberdeen to deliver the convoca
tion address was simply that of advertis
ing the institution anu attracting public
attention it has been abundantly attained.
The address of the Countess delivered on
Thursday was more fully reported and
widely printed than any her address of
the kind which has been delivered in this
country for many years.
The attention given to the address was
due mainly to the fact that it was the ad
dress of a countess. This is we believe the
first instance of the choice of a woman to
make an oration of the kind before a great
university in America, and the high social
position of the Countess ndaed to tbe at
traction which the novelty had for the
public. .
When full allowance is made, however,
for tbe interest In '.he personality of the
speaker it will be found that the address
itself was in every respect worthy of the
attention given it. The theme chosen was
"The University and Its Effect on the
Home." It dealt with the contrast be
tween knowledge and culture, and was de
signed to point out that our universities
should aim to give a culture which can
be carried into the home and add to the
value of family life as well as a Knowledge
which is useful in tbe office, the laboratory
or the market.
"The home," said the Countess, "has not
reap d that harvest of benefits from uni
versity education which might have been
expected." This fact she attributes to a
defect in the homo and declares that tbe
average home is not yet fitted for its mem
bers to eet all possible good from univer
sity education. * The majority of students
go to college unprepared for the higher
training they receive there, and as a con
sequence gather-knowledge of special
kinds rather than true culture and schol
arship.
The work of fitting tbe home to the
university and preparing it to send well
trained students to the seats of learning
is to be performed, says the Countess, by
tbe higher education of women. Much
has been accomplished in that way and
the movement is rapidly progressing. The
universities have developed the hearts and
minds of women, and they in turn have
developed in the home a culture which
did not exist there before. : - ..
The outlook for the future is therefore a
hopeful one. The home through highly
educated women will gain more and more
benefits from the universities, and the
universities in turn will gain more and
mure from t c homes. That is the ideal
which the Countess of Aberdeen sets be
fore. Chicago, and it will, be well worth
while for the uuiversity and the city to
give heed to it.
THE MISSISSIPPI PROBLEM.
The Chicago Times-Herald is regarding
the 'rising Mississippi out of . the corner of
its weather eye, and a low, dubious whis
tle is the result of what it-sees. Like The
Cau, it proceeds to set its flood-editor to
work devising some gigantic plan to stem
the awful current and put an ena to the
catastrophes which tue overflowing waters
bring upon the hapless lowlanders every
year. It is a problem which is rapidly
forcing itself before the whole country for
solution. It becomes more serious every
day and every year. " < ;-'
Several plans have been proposed. The
levee system if pronounced a total failure
and impossible of improvement to any
practical extent. C. Ellet, an engineer
who is familiar with the river from one
â¢nd to the other, advises tbe building of
huge reservoirs near the upper end, in
which to store the excess of water in win
ter and from which to liberate it in sum
mer, thus keeping, the river always uni
formly full and navigable, without danger
of an overflow. The Government would
have to build these reservoirs and there
would have to be considerably more than
two or three of them. Yet the plan is to
all appearances feasible, if somewhat ex
tensive. .
. Oilier less practical suggestions have
been offered, and only one more practical
one. Tbis latter seems to be the ideal and
only expedient. The Times-Herald claims
the original conception of it, and pro
pounds it as follows: -
The simplest of all plans is the adoption of
Irrigation In Northern lsrming, or in those
States whose waters are tributary 10 the Ohio
and Mississippi. It would accomplish two
great resultsâ it would make farming more
profitable and it. would prevent the disastrous
floods. Waters stored on Northern farms for
use in -midsummer cannot devastate the low
countries to the southward, while our farmers
would never suffer from a season of drought.
. At present the situation all along the
Mississippi Valley is . one of the gravest
that' the residents thereabouts have ever
had to lace. The water is' simply spread**
ing over the whole valley, driving every

thing before it. It has the' city of Rose
dale, Miss., entirely submerged and its
1000 citizens fleeing to the hills. Refugees
coming shivering'y into Jackson declare
that half of the misery has not been toldâ
that no pen could describe it. And all
the time the water is climbing over the
levees at the rate of an inch per hour. Is
it not time for something to be done? We
would advise those farmers at the upper
end to' begin irrigating pretty soon if tbey
are going to do it at all. The Times-Herald
should urge its proposition persistently
and systematically, where it will accom
plish the desired result. /â , ;
WILL THE SENATE ACT?
.The Senate has been doing a fine lot of
resolving about Cuba during the past
week. Thursday it had -.-before it four
measures affecting that battle-rocked
island. One was to instruct the American
administration to inform Spain that we
are unpersuaded of the Justice of Murderer
Weyler's treatment of prisoners of war;
another was the Morgan resolution con
cerning the letters of Maximo Gomez to
Presidents Cleveland and McKinley; an
other was a joint resolution to extend
belligerent rights to both the Spanish and
Cuban Governments in the ports and ter
ritories of tne United State?,, and the
fourth was an injunction against the ac
quisition of Cuba by any European power.
Of coarse nothing definitive came of
this resolving, there being a lackadaisical
absence of unanimity back of it. The
Senate hadn't much else to do, its discus
sion of the proposed Nicaraguan treaty,
looking to the completion of the canal,
having curled up to the blue say several
days before. So it would seem that a
good way to defeat one of the impending
disappointments of this mundane life
would be to forego at the outlet any hope
(hat these Cuban reso.utions will amount
to anything more than the same soaring
vapor. /iSSMnMB
Senator Morgan stated Thursday that
he was going to introduce still another
proposition iii Cuba's behalfâ one provid
ing for tbe shipping of food to the fam
ished Christians in Crete and Cuba, as the
American Government has already de
termined to send a ship-load to the starv
ing people in India. Is it likely that this
manifestly fair and consistent proposal
will go through? We venture to dare
one more disappointment in this matter
by earnestly hoping that it will. We
should liko to see America be at least a
little fairer than the other big powers of
the world, who are D >ins unfair to a de
gree which civilization has seldom seen
equaled. . . XX X

AUDITOR CALLS A HALT.
Mr. Brodertck Says That City and
- Couuty Hospital Expenditures
Are Far Too High.
As a result of Auditor Broderick's visit
to the City and County Hospital on Thurs
day last the Finance Committee of the
Board of Supervisors was notified yester
day that it was time to call a halt on the
expenditures for repairs to the sewer ays
tem of the institution.
Mr. Broderick did not lay any blame at
the door of the Supervisor*, but stated
that the excessive expense was the fault
of the Board of Health in using iron pipe
at $2 50 per foot when stone pipe at 35
cents a foot would have served just as
well. He declared that in consequence
improvements tbat were to have cost $500
will run into $4000 or $5000 if carried out.
Ha asked the committee not to authorize
any more demands for the present, as be
would be compelled to refuse to sign
tbem. The committee agreed to look
closely into the matter.
Later tbe contractor for the work pre
sented demands on the treasury drawn on
â¢'urgent necessity" blanks for oyer $800.
Auditor Broderick refused to consider
them and told the contractor lo place
them on hospital fund blanks and bave
them indorsed by the Finance Committee.

CUPID CAUGHT
IN MID-AIR
Genial Phil Hastings to
Wed Pretty Miss
Millie Viola.
She Is Queen of the Air and
Hi' Gilder of the Mmic
Attraction.
4 Wedding Hastily Arranged ani a
Bride Who May Changs Her
Mnl.
It all depends upon the pretty, daring
bride. If Mile. Millie Viola does not
change her mind, Monday, at noon, Phil
Hastings, the press assent of the Orpbeum
end tbe Chutes, will lead the graceful
aeronaut to the altar of Dr. Kip's Second
street church, and there in the presence
of his many theatrical and bohemian
friends promise to love and protect her. j
Genial Phil met his blushing bride at
the Chutes. He was at once smitten by
her pretty face and graceful figure, end
when he saw her dangling by her toes
from a dizzy, dazzling height he vowed a
solemn vow to make her Mrs. Hastings.
Phil's wooing was swift, straight and
successful. He lost no time in useless
courting, but stormed her heart at once,
and without a murmur the aerial artiste
capitulated. At first the date of the wed
ding was not mentioned. Then a horrid
theatrical contract, threatening to sepa
rate the lovers for lour months, spurred
Phil on to action. He urged an imme
diate union, and on Wednesday night
Millie Viola promised him the hand that
goes with her heart should be his on
Monday at noon.
Phil has been attending to all the de
tails of the; wedding. The limited time
previous to the ceremony has not per- i
mitted the anxious lover to send out |
cards.
"Monday at noon," he tells all . his
friends. "Come on. Dr. Kip's church on
Second street. You know, right next to
the brewery." And ail this keeps him so
busy that he can scarcely stop to shake
his many well-wishers by the hand. ' He
bas so much to attend to. There is tne
bridal trip and neckties and patent
leather boots and pink shirts in short, a
well-regulated press agent's trousseau.
But Phil is not tbe only busy party to
this contract. There is the bride, who,
by the way, when sire steps on terra tirma i
!is known as Miss Ruby Horaker. She !
also has "things" to prepare. With a I
friend she is domiciled at 437 O'Farrell
street, and since she has set tne day has
been up to her eyes in gowns and wraps
and tue other articles necessary for a
bride's outfit.
"I'm nervous," she says. "I wish it
was over. So much to do in so short a
time. Mr. Hastings, though, is attending
to all of it. We are to be married in some
churchâ l don't know where â and I really
don't know whether we are to have a wed
ding breakfast. I'm afraid Phil is not
well enough to eat a big meal. But we
are gome away â to Monterey for a whole
week. That is why I get married on
Monday. Mr. Hastings has to be at tbe
Orpheurn on Sunday, and if I married
later in the week that would spoil my out
in*r." . . ' â¢ â  â¢ -'-â 'â 'y *â .â â 'â :-â¢'. -E-.-" 1
Miss Viola, otherwise Horaker, holds
determined views as to the marriage state.
In the first plac*. the; wedding prepara
tions annoy and ruffle. her. and she is not
quite certain whether she may not yet
change her mind.
However, she is positive that she is not
going to settle down. ."I'm' getting mar
ried to have a better timeâ not to settle
down," she sententiously remarked. "If
Phil does not give it me â and an expres
sive shrug of the shoulders left nothing to
th* imagination. ft
Miss Horaser's wedding gown is to be
of brown satin. Her sister, Miss Essie
Horaker, ana her little niece, Miss Lulu
Ray wood, will be her bridal attendants. .
Dr. Happersberger will be on hand to
fiass the wedding circlet to the groom and
incidentally to offer condolences if Miss
Horaker changes her mind. m â . -

Young Queen -Daad.
The Occidental and Oriental Company's
â¢steamer Coptic got a great send-off as she
left the Mail dock.last Thursday, another
from the tugs arid steamers along the
water front and a third as she passed over
the bar from the lookout nt Point Lobos.
The occasion was the departure of Mrs.
and Miss Shotwell, the wife ana daughter
of the respected manager of the Mer
p chants' .Exchange. Captain Shotwell is
| one of the bast liked men in San Fran
cisco, and his home in Mill Valley is a
general rendezvous for all shipping men
in the City when tbey take a jaunt into
the country.
Nearly 150 people were down to see Mrs.
and Miss Shotwell off on their tour of the
Orient, but many of them left for Point
Loboi before the last gong went. Among
them was Captain Shotwell and his son
j and a large party of their male friends,
j the ladies remaining at the wharf.
When the Coptic passed out the bar was
breaking on Doth banks and the vessel
: was deluged with spray. She went out
I through the north channel, and when in
; a line with Point Lobo? 'and on the crest
jol a r wave Pilot Jordan ordered three
] blasts of the whistle. "Johnny," the out
j look at the Point, at once responded by
dipping the flag while the gentlemen
j waved their handkerchiefs. Ten minutes
I later the Coptic was lost in the mist and
! flying- spray.
Ed Vanderworker, an employe of the D.
j H. Bibb Lumber Company, was nearly
â  killed while working in the mill yester-
I day. He was handling one of the ma
i chines when a knife flew out of its socket
j and struck him in the groin, making a
, wound eight inches long. The company
; at once called in a surgeon, who tempor-
I arily stopped the flow of blood. A few
stitches were put in and then an ambu
lance was sent for and Vanderworker was
taken to his home in Oakland. The sur
geon went with m, and it was lucky he
did, as twice the wound broke out afresh. !
On arriving he was driven to a private j
hospital, and the .company will see to it |
I that be gets every attention and care.
Rain or shine the North Beach regatta '
; will take place to-morrow. Crowley and j
I Fitzgerald are in active training for their

tries for the $5 sweepstake race. The best
boats in the .bay have been entered in
this event and the contest should be a
close one. The judges will be George W.
Root, Thomas A. McGowan and L. V.
Merle. The starter will be Dan Crowley,
ami the timekeeper H. S. Scott.
Friends and relatives of those who went
away on the brig Percy Edwards are won
dering when they will hear from them
again.. Captain Luttrell, who recently re
turned from tne South Seas, and who
knows Oceanica from one end to the' other,
asserts thai there is not an island on
which they will be allowed to land. Every
one of tbem are under a protectorate, and
during. his last voyage on the Vine he was
fined' sioo for -landing a woman without
permission. - : â¢'â¢ ' "â¢ "'; ;
"Every man who sailed for the' Adam
less Elen," said Captain Luttrell, "had it
in black and white that be was -entitled to
an equal chance to woo and win the hand
some young queen. "j Now the fact of the
matter is that the handsome young queen
died two years ago, and an old and with
ered hag now rules over the group. In
that particular group there are not a
] dozen good-looking girls, and even these
j become very, repulsive alter - marriage.
I'm afraid the expedition will end in dis
aster."
â  The steamer Tiburon, after being on the
ways for a month, was put on the run be-
I twee here and Tiburon on the San Fran
cisco and -North Pacitic line yesterday.
Her engines and boilers have been thor
oughly overhauled, and the engineer now
expects to make the run in twenty mln
uics. The decks have been replanked,
the cabin newly upholstered and a series
of pictures of scenes alone the railroad
route have been put in as panels. The
bar is one of the handsomest on any ship
or ferry-boat on the bay, and ex-Judge
Hayden. of Tiburoti and bis son are in
supreme command. ,
A* new departure in the recovery of the
treasure lost from the steamer Sunol has
been taken. The wr.cker Whitelaw has
been withdrawn and the tugs Millie ana
Jessie Matson substituted. The large
yawls from the schooners Shasta, Pinole,
Solano and Carrier Dove will assist, and
each ono- of the six boats will have oat a
dragnet. They will be able to cover a
much greater distance ' in consequence,
and General Manager A. E. Pryor, who is
superintending the job, is confident of
success. He was out all of yesterday lo
cating .' the boats, and. will begin opera
tions early tbis-morning.
The men on the schooner Antelope bad
i a terrible time of it during the trip from
Cbquille River. On March 23, when off
Cape Bianco, a very heavy southeasterly
gale sprang up, and the vessel was in im
minent danger for a time. Whet; the
well was sounded . it was discovered that
sue was leaking badly. From that time
until port was reached the men had to
stand watch-and-watcn at the pumps, and
they considered themselves lucky when a
safe anchorage was reached.

Two Supreme Court Deci

Parallel. .â¢*-'-
Alleged Discrepancies in the
Reasonings of the Learned

Currant's Case Contrasted With the
Cass of Buckley, Con v.cted of
Election Frauds-
Judge Wallace made a scathing speech
I from the bench yesterday touching recent
j Supreme Court decisions when the case of
! Jerome A. Buckley came up for hearing
! on an application to dismiss the prisoner
I from custody. Justices Temple and Hen
| shaw were referred to in terms polite but
; caustic, and the, conditions of jurispru-
I dence in California were dwelt on at con-
I siderable length.

DRAWING THE DEADLY PARALLEL.
Supreme Court Decisions Contrasted by Superior Court Judge I
Wallace.
...â¢â¢i-i-/: March Buckley Case.
As presented here (ln the printed record)
the transcript contains no evidence tending to
show guilt in the defendant. It would appear
that the only inculpating evidence before the
jury consisted of the comparison by the jury
itself of certain handwriting proven tv be
that of the defendant, with altered portions
of the tally lists. The tally lists are not in the
records in. any form (That Is a mistake. See
printed transcript, folio 179.) and neither
the original nor any iac-simtie of either paper
is presented here. The point is mado that the
evidence does not sustain the verdict. Of
course, since the only evidence consisted in
the comparison of handwriting by the jury,
the record here (printed) does .not- show
whether there was any probative force ln the
evidence. â¢ Â« â¦ The defendant contends
that * * * it was incumbent on the prose- ,
cution to have put into the bill (of exception)
some evidenceâ if any there wasâ which would
make it appear to this court that there was
any proof of the participation of defendant in
the crime specified. * â¢ . * But although it
was incumbent upon the people to see tha the
bill of exceptions contained some evidence
tending to establish . every element of the
crime, still they could not, under the s'.aiute
and the rules of the court, incorporate into It
the original papers. Nor was it the duty of
the prosecution or indeed permissible under
the code to provide photographs of the writing.
It was only possible, under the Penal Code, for
it to do just 'what* it' did doâ state what evi
dence was submitted to the jury. It then be
came one of the numerous cases in which we j
are at a disadvantage in weighing tne cvi- j
dence. It eanuot be represented or pictured
here as the jury and the court saw it.
was put in evidence together with a written
paper containing the identical words and
figures contained in the alleged falsifica
tion of the tally list.
These writings were submitted to the
jury, together with other testimony show
ing that Buckley had possession of the re
turns together with L. M. Martinet for
the purpose of transmitting them to the
Registrar of Voters and the Board of
Election Commissioners. Witnesses .were,
introduced to prove the time that elapsed
between the moment' that Buckley and
Martinet left the voting booth and the de
livery of the returns to the Registrar.
After hearing the evidence and compar
ing the handwriting on the falsified re
turns with the handwriting of Buckley,
a jury and Judge Wallace's department of
the Superior Court decided that Buckley
was the person who did the work, and re
turned a verdict of guilty. Judge Wallace
refused to grant a new trial.
An appeal was taken to the Buprema
Court, and on the Ist of last month an
opinion reversing the judgment of the
lower court Was banded down, signed by
Justice Temple and concurred in by Jus
tices Van Fleet. Henshaw, McFarland,
'Harrison and Garoutte. Justices McFar
land, Harrison and Garoutte wrote sepa
rate opinions on matters not altogether
covered by the opinion written by Justice
Temple. It was not held by the Supreme
Court tbat any error oi law occurred at the
trial. ;
When the remittitur was presented by
Attorneys Byrne and Guilfoyle on be
hall of Buckley yesterday Judge Wallace
availed himself of the opportunity to
express his views in re card to the status
of the case. He said that while he holds
the Supreme Court and the learned Jus
tices composing it in the highest esteem
and respect, yet he felt it bis duty to refer
briefly to the decision of the appellate
court in this matter. '.
One point made by the defendant Buck
ley is tbat be was not given a trial within
sixty days of the tiling of the indictment
or information as provided by the Crimi
nal Code. That question was raised at
the trial,* and Judge Wallace ruled that
the rul<* of law ; which guaranteed a trial
to a defendant * v itbin sixty days apnlied
only to defendants who have not within
that time obtained a postponement. Such
is the plain provision of the code".
Buckley's case was called for trial
.within the sixty days, and tbe prosecu
tion was ready to ; proceed; but: the de
fendant asked for., a postponement of one
day, and on bis application it was granted.
Judge .Wallace ruled that after that Buck
ley baa no legal right to invoke the sixty- 1
day rale in order to secure the dismissal
of the charge against him.
In commenting on the Supreme Court's
decision Judge Wallace said it appears
that the Supreme Court does not consider
a postponement of one day a postpone
ment at all. If this be true, he remarked,
then the trial courts must be in an unset
tled state touching this question until the
number of days' delay required to consti
tute a postponement has been determined
on by. tne Supreme Court. If one day's
delay does not constitute a postponement,
would two? Would it be possible under
this rule to say how many days' delay
would constitute an actual postpone
ment?
Ihe Supreme Court now complains that
its calendar is congested witn appeals in
such matters, yet if this rule is not speed
ily "brought to a definite interpretation the
appeals from tbe criminal courts all over
the State will begreatlv increased in num
ber.
This phase of the decision, however, did
not receive so much of Judge Wallace's
criticism as did that part in whicn the
Supreme Court dealt with the alleged in
sufficiency of evidence to sustain the ver
dict and the rules of law touching the
province of the Supreme Court in review
ing the acts of the lower court.
His Honor had before him a paper con
taining extracts from the Buckley de
cision, put in contrast with othe*- quota
tions from the decision in the Durrant
case, whicn was handed down two days
later.
Afjer reading these quotations, which
for convenience Judge Wallace had placed
in the lorm of the "deadly parallel" so
often resorted to by journalists as we'l as
jurists, his Honor made some "free-hand"
comments which proved entertaining to
the many members of the bar who were
present.
In regard to the presumption of inno
cence. Judge Wallace said that no such
presumption exists in the appellate court.
When a man is charged with a crime the
presumption is tbat he is guilty or no war
rant could be Issued for his arrest. When
he is placed on his defense and he pleads
"not guilty" the presumption is in favor
of his innocence. This presumption must
be overcome by the prosecution, who must
prove the guilt of the defendant beyond a
reasonable doubt. Alter the prisoner is
I..X."March 3âDurrani Case.
This court, sits in criminal cases solely lor
the correction of errors at .law. If lv any
criminal case there be evidence adduced logi
cally tending and legally sufficient to show
the cullt of the defendant, this court cannot
and will not disturb the jury's determination,
even under a claim that there is conflicting
evidence, which might have raised a reasona
ble doubt of hi guilt.
*****â¢Â»#
The province of the jury in weighing evi
dence and determining the degree ol credi
bility to be accorded the testimony of wit
nesses Is, under the rules of law, exclusive.

Upon a review of the evidence of this tribu
nal we may not examine with minuteness
claims that witnesses are discredited, or that
their evidence is unworthy of belief, or look to
see whether some other conclusion might not
have been warranted by the evidence. . Blythe

When it is not clear that the verdict must have

convicted and an appeal is taken to tbe
Supreme Court the rule in regard to the
presumption of innocence changes. Tuis
must necessarily be so.
It has been recognized by courts as ele
mental through all the history of criminal
jurisprudence, said Judge Wallace, yet
here for the first time was the spectacle of
the presumption of innocence following
the defendant to the appellate court. He
could not understand ibis strange condi
tion of affairs, for he read in the opinion
of the Supreme Court that no errors in
the law had been commuted in the trial
court.
Judge Wallace said he could not ex
actly understand Justice Temple's re
mark that the conviction of Buckley was
an outrage. He did not know of any out
rage in the case, as the trial bad* been
properly conducted, and the jury was
composed of citizens of exceptional intel
ligence.
A remarkable phase of the - matter, ac
cording. to Judge Wallace's ideas, was that
a man o! Justice Hensbaw's erudition
should have signed the opinion in the
Buckley case, which he said was a clear
divergence from the established rule of
law in criminal juri-prudence, and then
forty-eight hours later give utterance to
the learned opinion in the. Durrant case,
which is based on the tree theory of crim
inal law and practice and conforms with
the requirements of the constitution of
California. - He was forced to the conclu
sion that the signing of the Buckley
opinion by Justice Henshaw was there
suit of inadvertence resulting from the
practice of sending opinions around to
the various chambers of Justices for sig
natures in the Supreme Court' instead of
having the opinions considered at a gen
eral meeting of the Justices.
However, it appeared that there was
some hope, for as the Durrani decision is
later than the Buckley decision, Judge
Wallace said it must be accepted tnat the
Buckley case was. thereby oveirnled, and
proceeding on that theory he would deny
the motion to discbarge ihe prisoner from
custody. If the Supreme ' Court should
issue a mandate for the release of Buckley
thai order wouid be obeyed, of course, but
until the doctrine laid down in the Dur
rant case is ' reversed by the appellate
court he would not be a party to any such
proceeding.

FAHEY A MEMBER
OF THE IROQUOIS
The Opposition to Him
\f .'Ruled Out by the
â  \ Chairman.
He Had Many Strong Champions
in the Club Member
. ship.
E. P. E. Troy Conducts a Hot Fight
Against Him and Threatens to
Carry It to Court.
The blackballing of "William Fahey
threw the Iroquois Club into a tumult
last evening. Fahey, proprietor of the
Cosmopolitan Hotel and a stanch Demo
crat, duly proposed for membership, came
up for election at the meeting of . the club
last week and four black balls were cast
against him. Five black balls would have
rejected him as a member. Four black
ballsâone black ball would have done the
same held the matter suspended for a
week.
The by-laws require that in the mean
time those casting the black balls must
state their objections in writing to the
chairman, and the chairman must make
them known to the club, and. -if there be
no other objection he may declare the
candidate elected.
. Of the four who threw the black balls
only one followed the requirements of tbe
constitution and stated his objections in
writing. : That ono was E. P. E. Troy.
Troy did not hesitate at confessing to be
tbe man nor at having his reasons staled
openly. The reasons, as stated, were that
Fabey had not borne a good reputation
for honesty in politics during bis residence
in other portions of the State, and espe
cially he bad fizured discreditrbly "during
that reign of terror in Fresno that culmi
nated in the McWhirter murder.".
The result of the election last week put
Fabey on his mettle, and he had been
particularly active during the week to
meet and overcome the objection to him.
Several influential champions of his cause
were developed, and the knowledge tbat
the case was to ba fonght out last night
resulted in an unusually large attendance.
Walker CL Graves first entered the
breach in Fahey's behalf. He read a num
ber of letters addressed to Fabey from
well-known Democrats of tbe places
where tbe latter was said to have been in
disrepute, as well as from this City.
When it came his turn Troy insisted
that bis protest stood, and under the by
laws required that another ballot be taken.
Chairman Lemmon ruled that, inas
much as three of the four who had cast
the black balls had not fulfilled the re
quirements of the constitution by filing
their objections in writing, and that there
were no new objections, he would declare
the candidate elected.
Troy protested. He declared the ruling
to be unjust ; and appealed from the de
cision of the chair, holding that he him
self had given additional reasons why
Fahey should be rejected, and ; that this
made it mandatory on the chair to call for
another election.
- L. V. -Merle hotly answered this state
ment by saying that he also did not be
lieve it was fair. He believed that Troy
bad himself cast all four of the black
balls. â â WS&Â£&8$&&&8&i
Ray mon Robbins and others seconded
the appeal. Robbins mode a speech and
declared the ruling to be a blow at the
fundamental law of the club; that the
president should have asked if there were
any other reasons before ruling tbat there
were none.
| Tbeq^iestion was put and the chair was
sustained amid much excitement. .
Troy insisted that the proceeding was
illegal and said flatly that he would take
the matter into the courts.
Fabey bad been in the anteroom during
most of the discussion and was called in
and introduced.- In responding to calls for
a speech be made quite a feeling address.
He said that he 'had been often asked
to join the club, and finally in response
had allowed bis name to be presented. He
was much surprised at the apposition pro
voked and knew no cause for it, for he
would challenge any man, he said, to
show any proof of a dishonest or discredit
able act in his life. T" U' i f flfJtWlÃÃfWi
fie would not for $1000 have bad this
contest occur,' but it had developed more
friends than he was aware ' he had in the
organization.
; He had made a fight against those who
opposed him, but now that he had won he
would not promise to remain in the club.
The little speech was well received.
, After the club adjourned he invited all
bands down to his place on Mission
street. , '.'.""' \

FIELD OF SPORT.
The Anglers' . Day Has Arrivedâ AU^ About the
Rifle, Bat, Oar and Leash. â¢ "^ - v
In all.probability there will be' a. boom
in baseball 'this summer. The arrival of
the Australian baseball-players, who. are
due here on Thursday, will give an im
petus to the sport. .
The., yachtsmen are getting ready as
fast as possible for the opening of the
season*, which gives promise of much bril
liancy.
The anglers have had a bad setback, ow
ing: to the heavy rains, of recent date, but
the north winds are assisting very materi
ally* in placing the 'streams in condition
for fly and spoon fishing. . l
The sportsmen are having much pleas
ure at tbeir favorite pastime which is blue
rock shooting. The rifle-shooters are ex
pecting a greal'day's outing to-morrow at
the San Rafael Park, where the annual
outing and prizVsbpoting festival, of the
California Schuetzen Club will be held.
THE WHEELMEN.
To-Morrow the Great Annual Re
" lay Race Around the
Bay. . '
Everything is in readiness for the great
annual relay. race of the California Asso
ciated Cycling Clubs, which will take
place to-morrow. ' Tlys afternoon the
riders, trailers and officials will go to their
positions on the different relays, so as to
be on the ground in ample time. In fact
then-relay riders themselves have all been
training over their various courses for a
week or.more, some of them two or three
times a day. Even the recent storms did
not interfere with this preparatory work,
forrelay races are run rain or shine, and
it is well for a man to be experienced over
his course in both wet and dry gome.
The ten clubs that have entered teams
are the same as last year with one excep
tion". ..The San Jose Road Club is out of
existence,* so its place has been taken by
the Capital City Wheelmen of Sacra
jpento, who "have entered a strong team.
The race* start promptly at 9 o'clock
to-morrow morning from in front of tbe
Biclorama, corner ot Market and Tenth
streets. J The route out of the City is from
there to Ninth street, down Ninth to F.d
scm and out Folsom to Twenty-fourth,
finally reaching the San Bruno road. The
relay packet should reach San Jose in less
tban two hours and a half, and it will
take tne same time to bring it up on the
other side. The total ride of 100 miles
will be made in about four hours and
fifty minutes, the finish taking place at
"avenue and Grand street, Ala
meda, about 1:50 to-morrow afternoon.
Herbert Clarke of the Alameda Cyclers
has conceived a novel idea in connection
with the relay which he will put into
execution to-morrow. A number of the
members of the Signal Serv.ce Corps will
be stationed on tbe relays on the Oakland
side of the way. They will flash signals
of the men and tbeir positions to some
point on the Alameda hills, from where it
will in turn be transmitted to signal men
in Alameda. 'â¢
The colors of the riders in the relay will
be as follows:
Alameda Cyclers, orange and black; Bay
City Wheelmen, old gold and crimson; Garden
City Cyclers, black; Olympic Club Wheelmen,
white; Imperial Cycling Club, white and royal
purple; San Francisco Road Ciub, red suit,
white sash; Acme Club, red and black; Cali
fornia Cycling Club, oiivo green snd orange;
Reliance Club Wheelmen, maroon and white
star. ..-The Capitr.l City Wheelmen have riot
selected any distinctive colors.
The regular bi-monthly meeting of the
hoard of governors of the California Asso
ciated Cycling Clubs will be held this
evening at the rooms of the Imperial
Cycling" Club, 614 Van Ness avenue. Be
sides the usual routine business and mat
ters pectaini'ng to the relay, the all-im
portant question of the C. A." C. C. taking
up the ..work of the League of American
Wheelmen in this State will come up for
final discussion, and a committee which
has had the matter in charge will submit
ita.repo.rt to the board. The importance
of this'cuestion demands personal repre
sentation from every club in the associn
' lion.' If it is impossible for any delegates
to be present they should send their prox
ies to the secretary, 636 Market street, to
day, with instructions how the vote is to
be cast.

ment has been arranged, which, accom
panied by -the usual excellent menu of
eatable and drinkables and the "glad

O. Cs are famed, assures a most en joy

The sportsmen of Alameda Countyâ ana
. they number - several hundrea^-are a unit
in favor of 'Gam* Warden Donovan being
â¢ retained in the * position ' he has so faith
fully filled for the past* year. Mr. Dono
van has been instrumental in having
many of the streams in' Alameda County
stocked with game "fishes, and the several
. . arrests he has made of poachers have very
materially lessened the destruction of
â¢game during the closed season. The fol
lowing letter is self-explanatory:
Apart from the excellent work done by Don
ovan, the incumbent, it is pointed out that
tho office is absolutely necessary. The State
nas spent nearly $3000 in stocking the
streams with fish, and It is certain that not a
cent would be expended had it not been
known that there was a game warden here. .
Then again it must not be forgotten that
Alameda County possesses some of the finest
tishing ground*- in the State, the Alameda,
Mocho and Bayou creeks being known all
over the coast ia fishing circles. It would not
take long, though, to fi>h them out II tne pro
tection of the warden were withdrawn, and
on this ground a one it is apparent how essen
tial it is to have an officer to enforce the game
laws.
The same is true as regards birds. Unless
they were protected, in a year there would
scarcely be a dove in Alameda County, and all
other kinds of game would be ruthlessly
slaughtered. It is impossible, as suggested by
the Grand Jury, to have the duties of Gamo
\V*rden performed by the other peace officers,
because they cannot devote the time and at
tention needed to such special work.
All the sporting associations of the county
are joining in the appeal that is going up from
tne interior, Rtid as the gun and lish clubs
number about 500 well-known citizens their
protest will be powerful. They will have a
right to be heard, too, for they are in many in

Donovan, the incumbent in the wsrdenshlp,
is. credited, with being the most efficient
warden in this State. The salary is only $100
a month, and he spends fully that sum, lor he
is on the go all the time, it is a labor of love
with him. for he is an ardent sportsman, and
his removal would wreak a gooa deal more
harm than is entailed by his mild attack on
the. county payroll.
THE ANGLER.
The Streams Are Clearing and the
Prospects for To-Morrow
Are Good.
Quite a number of anglers who could not
possibly miss tue opportunity of wetting
a line on the first ay of the season re
turned yesterday from favorite streams
with empty baskets and hungry stomachs.
They report that the creeks are too high
and that the trout are so fat and lazy
from devouring "fruits" of all kinds that
they turn tail upon anything in the line
of tempting food that an angler presents;
but it is said, in undertones, of course,
that George Walker has a June bug and
Doc Watt a little brambling worm which
will tempt the most aristocratic denizen
of .the babbling brook "to catch on" the
instant that the lures pass within his ob
servation.
Colonel Cooper, who is a stanch believer
in Walker's celebrated bamboo cast, will
journey to a little stream in Santa Cruz
County, from which he expects to steal a
nice basket of fish. Cooper will certainly
return with some beauties, as he is an
artist of the old school.
Dan O'Connell, the poet and Bohemian,
will Arab liku steal away to a promising
stream not lar distant from Sausalito, and
it is dollars to peanuts that "the Dan"
will return with something weighty. If
he has not fish he will have a story well
worth the attention of anglers.
John Lemmer, 0. Mouser, John Bergez
and several members of the Tarnalpais
Club will wet lines in the Throckmorton
lagoon. It is said that Tom Casey, "the
old man of the hills," and his dog-Dot
will join Senator Sydney Hall at Point
Keves to-morrow.
Louis Kandeau and C. Prerht will try
the Glen Ellen stream. Billy Cooney ami
friends ha7e arranged for % day's outing
in Sonoma County. A large number of
â¢anglers will spend the better part of to
morrow on the Lagunitas and Paper-mill
creeks.
Fish Commissioners Emeric and Vogel
sang are prospecting for trout in some of
the streams that empty into tho upper
Sacramento River.
Fly fishing is out of question at present,
and according to the appearance of weather
and water there will not be any fly fishing
worth mentioning until next monlh. The
spoon and. the worm are tbe lures that
will be used to the best advantage until
the streams assume their summer appear

The.. following Jletter from Lakeport to
The Call Is self-explanatory :
.nvsi Lakeport, April 1, 1897.
For some time the (tame and tish laws of
the Stats have oeen violated in this county,
and the game a d fish are threatened with
extinction. The abuse has become so great
that men and boys break the laws openly and
sell trout and venison in the open market: *
.Heretofore there have been no deputy game
wardens, acd no one cared to take the respon
sibility on themselves of having the law en
forced because of the odium it would put upon ,
them by- the law-breakers and the business
Interests it would injure.
In order to overcome this difficulty the law
abiding element has organized The Lake
County Game Protective Association, with the
following officers and directors:. President,
Sanford Parrish ; vice-president. Dr. C. W. Kel
logg; secretary, H. \V. Brewer; treasurer, Wil
lis Greene; directorsâ W. H. Liwrence, E. S.
Martin, IL W. Brewer, A. H..Spurr, M. B. El
liott.
All of these will be deputized by the State
Game War Jen. The association expects to have
a membership of several hundred, and will
bend their united efforts to th*) cause they
have espoused. All persons found breaking
the law will be prosecuted to tne fullest ex
tent.

doing good work since the iast meeting
and will have an interesting report to ren
der on, next Sunday morning. At that

THE YACHTSMAN.
The Encinals Decide Not to Race
This Season.
Tbe directors of the Encinal Yacht Club
have decided not to defend the perpetual
challenge cup this year and under the arti
cles of agreement it will pass to the San
Francisco Yacht Club, which will bo the
cup-defender for 1897. The cup has been
won twice by the Encinals.
It is expected that at the next meeting
of tbe Corinthian Yacht Club the board
of directors "will challenge on behalf of
the Truant for the cup relinquished by the
Encinals.
Considerable damage was done to the
Corinthian fleet at Tiburon last Saturday
night. Frank Bartlett's, yacht Queen
dragged her moorings and fouled the
Cisne, carrying away the tatter's bowsprit
and forward rigging.- She also fouled the
schooner Flying Jib, carrying away the
foretopmast. The Queen escaped with
comparatively little uamage.
The Cisne also dragged her moorings
and fouled the Freda. The only damage
sustained was the scratching of the
Freda's paint, which will necessitate re
painting. i
Owing to the fact that the Nixie and the
Clara are on the ways, the yachtsmen at
Tiburon are in a dilemma, as there is a
i-carcuy of ways, and the boats will have
to go on the beach to have their bottoms
scraped.
Ex-Commodore Pew's yacht Truant is
on Frank Stone's ways, preparatory to her
being put in commission. .
The Lurline and the Kamona were out
during the blow last Sunday under reefea
mainsails and storm jibs. The boats pre
sented a fine appearance as they sailed
through Raccoon Straits. \
The first of the Corinthians' boats to be
placed in commission is the yawl Pir.ta.
She was out lor a sail last Sunday.
It is expected that Morrow <fe Wesler
feld's yacht .Eolus will be put in commis
sion to-morrow. .
BASEBALL.
The Australian Team Will Arrive
on Thursdayâ To- Morrow's
Games.
Doubtless there will be a large gathering
of baseball and cricket players at the Mail
dock on Thursday to receive and welcome
the Australian baseball players who are
on board the steamer Monowai. I
The invaders will play a series of games
in this City before they will journey to
the East and it is boned that the patrons
of the National game will show their ap
preciation by turning out in strong force
to see how the Australians will compare
with home talent.
It is said that the foreigners play excel
lent ball and that they will give their op
ponents a surprise, especially in fie. ding
and base-running.
The first game will be played at Central
Park on Sunday, the 18. inst., between
tbe Australian and Olympic Club teams,
when a large and enthusiastic crowd will
certainly witness the contest.
The San Francisco Athletic Club hopes
to wipe out the defeat inflicted on it by
the San Francisco Violets. Tbe Athletic
Club has met and defeated the best ama
teur teams of tbis State, but -when it lines
up against the Violets it becomes" faint
hearted and the Violets go home happy.
It expects t&*-reirieve itself to-morrow.

A SELLING-RACE
WAR IS NOW, ON
Corrigan Bid Up and Se
cured the Plater
Wyoming.
A Race Taken Away From
Suisun on a Questionable -
Claim of Foul.
Fort Augustus Won at Oddi of
VV! 60 to San Marco First in
a Gruelling Driv*.
There was a noticeable lack of bustle
and business at Ingleside track yesterday.
Friday is usually a dull day at'the track,
and it proved no exception to the rule.
Six events were down for decision, of
which favorites took three. The track
was deep and slow time was the rule.
An incident of the afternoon's sport
was the bidding up of Wyoming, owned
by A. B. Spreckels. The big horse won
the fifth event, a mile selling run, entered
to be sold for $500. His price was boosted
to $1000 by E. Corrigan, who secured the
horse. As both of his fore feet are in poor
condition it is questionable whether or
not the master of Hawthorne and Ingle
side secured much of a bargain.
California was given a race on a ques
tionable foul, but as Chicago and the
Middle Western clique had their checks
down on the mare good and hard there
was no howl over the affair. The native
racegoers generally do get the crumbs of
the bai-quet. Ingleside's once famed pop
larity is rapidly falling into decay.
There was plenty of doing about Sal
mera in the two-year-old race, and backed
down from 7 to 5 to 4 to 5 the daughter of
Salvator made ail the running, beating out
La Maroma at the end by three furlongs,
covering tbe four furiongs in 50 seconds.
The latter swerved badly in the stretch,
ruining her cnance of victory.
Don Clarencio, the 13 to 20 choice for
the next event, a mile and a sixteenth
selling affair, was beaten through poor
rid me. Ciawson managed to get his
mount cut off at the far turn, and in a
punishing drive was led out by the 60 to 1
shot Fort Augustus, ridden by Slaughter.
Suisun won the third event, a six-fur
long purse event, in a hard drive from
California, and was then disqualified for a
foul. The latter was extens-ivelv played,
her odds being cut irom 6 to 5 to 9 to 10,
and fought it out ail the way with Leigh's*
filly. Tod Slcan, on Suisun, bumped
California near the furlong pole, and on
"Skeets" Martin, who rode the favorite,
claiming a foul, it was allowed, to the in
tense action of the crowd.
The mile selling run that followed
furnished tbe most exciting finish of the
day. San Marco, the 11 to 10 choice,
stubbornly contested every foot of ground
through the stretch with the second choice,
Hazard, and at tbe wire got the decision
by a nose. Morte Fonse, ridden by
McHugh, was a good third.
Wyoming, at odds of 6 to 1, captured
the seven furlong selling run that followed
and changed hands. Caliente was alto 2
chance in the betting, but was outfooted
through the stretcu and beaten out less
than a length by the* Spreckels entry,
which ruled a second choice in the ring.'
The concluding race on the programme,
a mile purse, went to Vincitor, which
went to the post an 8 to 5 choice, with St.
Distaff at odds of 2to 1 next in demand.
Taking the lead from Tulare on entering
the stretch, the favorite downed that
gelding very handily, covering the distance
inl:44Ji. _____^_
NOTES.
The $5000 California Derby is down for
decision to-day. The best three-year-olds
in training will face the issue.
The sale of the Macdonough two-year
olds will take place at Killip & Co.'s stock
yard Thursday evening, April 8.
Saivablc fails into another manufactured
race to-day and looks a 1 to 20 chance.
Willie Martin's ride on David was ad
mired by all. While not persuasive, it
was a clever bit of horsemanship. Jock

PEBMIT j BECOMMENDED. (
Matters Disposed Of by the Health and
Police Committee l'eÂ«terday. .
The Health and Police Committee of
the Board of Supervisors decided yester
day to recommend that the National
Athletic Club be granted a permit to con
duct a boxing exhibition, not to exceed
twenty rounds, on the night of the 23d
inst. The ciub is to pay a license fee of
$100 and also 5 per cent of the gross re
ceipts into the lund for the relief of the
unemployed. -
The application of the South San Fran
j Cisco Gun Club to be permitted to conduct
! trap-shooting matches within the City
and County was laid over for one week,
I to permit the . expert of ihe Street Com
! mittee to examine into the matter and
report as to the danger to citizens from
the shooting range. â 
The committee recommended placing on
file the application for a patrol-wagon at
the new O'Farrell-street police station, on
the ground that a wagon has already been
detailed for the station, and an applica
tion for more police boxes in the Rich
mond District.
The application of the Point Lobos Im
| provement* Club, that the Market-street
j Railway Company be compelled to lower
| its tracks on Lake street, between First
j and Second avenues, beiore bids for the
I paving of the thoroughfare are let, was
I reported upon favorably.
Compass Adjustment.
The Chamber of Commerce has addressed
letters to the United States Coast and Geodetic
Survey and to the United States Branch Hy
drographic Office in this City in relation to
the necessity for providing, as an aid to navi
gation in the bay of San Fraucisco, a system of
compass line bearings and of fixed moorings
to be placed in the harbor for the "swinging"
of ships and steamers desiring to have their
compasses adjusted. There is a conviction
that most of tue losses on this coast have beeu
occasioned by defective compasses, and that
not sufficient attention has been Generally
paid -to their adjustment. The question is one
ln which underwriters, â hip-owners and sea
men are all interested, and the Chamber of
Commerce proposes to push the matter until
the needed improvement nas been obtained.
A Young Women* Meeting.
To-morrow afternoon, at 3 o'clock, there will
be a meeting for young women at the Young
Women's Christian Association, at 1221 O'Far
rell street, at which Mrs. M. P Ferguson of Lob
Angeles will preside. Mrs. Ferguson has a
wide reputation as a Bible teacher. All young
women are invited.

It was suggested by Chairman Hawkes

â¢I must speak.." ..-.;Â»:,-,.*
.Mr. Silver's present 'address is at 605
Larkin street. His additions to-his-former
tale include the following wonderful state
ments:* "' ; /; - : '. ' '
"An .old Indian : chief down ih thai
region told me that th^re is. cave of gold
higber*un iv the Andes' than I have yet j
been. When I return is going to guide I
me and Mr. Palmer to the place. I am â 
convinced that he is telling rae the truth, ;
because there must bo some great source
whence all the- cold* lower down must
have been washed.
- "The natives take sheepskins. and trim
the hair very short, then run water over
the gravel and through the skin.. All the
coarse gold that collects in the hair, is re
tained. The rest is cast aside.*.
. "At Haamachuca there is a Spanish
business house run by- Gonzales Bros.
One day there they took in about $75,000,
--000 from- the Indians, and must have given
only about $12*000 in Peruvian silver coin
in exchange."
"Men have tried to ' follow tbem to*
-where they got it,, but though they bring
in as many.as three or four pouches of
gold at a time ho one bas yet been able
to trace them to the source whence it is
obtained. * -^ 'v';~
"At Tapaz the Spanish, 180 years ago, it
is .said, took- out millions of dollars
with arastras. They struck a vein of
water, which filled the hole where the
.quartz, was obtained, and it" remains now
identically as it was years ago. As soon
as I get my machinery down there I oe
lieve h will be no trick at all to take
$50,000 out in a couple of months.* ' ,
"About eight leagues from Tayabamba
there, are about sixty acres ot 'decomposed j
quar:z which can be. kicked to pieces with
the foot. Well, gold in that quartz is
free gold and in lumps. - A -, -'?'â . i
"But the only men that know where
! these places at present are my friend
Palmer and mytelf. Why should we con
ceal the. fact? There is more than twenty
men could secure in a lifetime: Some of
the places' are so difficult to reach that a
single false step, of a burro would send
both man and animal down 3000 :eet.". -.Â».
After a statement . that the famous
Ophir*mines of King Solomon, in his be
lief are-' located in Peru,. Mr. Silver feiter- '
ated his, statement that' he neither wishes
to buy nor sell, and- is going to form no
companies. His idea of the country in
general he gave in the following original
translation. of a. poem of the Incas:

it is said, woufd have- been done long ago j
by the owners; were it not for the fact that j
the Fire Marshal found fault with certain j
details ef construction in connection with
that Dart of the building reserved for the j
theater. 'â * 'Xy -'^X~

'interested in the new scheme, but whether
or not this means that he will "appear as
a heavy financial backer, those who know
decline to state. The Mayor, however,
says he has not made up his mind about
the matter.
Haworth's plan is to give nothing at tbe
new play hot. S3 but the highest c'ass of
productions. He proposes to begin with
a season of three months of stock-com
pany entertainment. In this company
himself and Countess Modjeska are to be
the bright, shining lights. This company
will then go on the road, and the Lyceum
â for that is to be the name of the new
playhouse, if it become a realityâ will be
given over for a three mouths' season of
high-class vaudeville.
Following this will come another three
months with the stock company, and then
a final three months of grand opera.
It is.intended to spend $50,000 in fitting
up the new theater, and this will be borne
by the owners of the St. Nicholas Hotel,

The interest which the Chamber of

Pan Francisco, April 2, 1897.
To the Honorable Boa? d of Begents, California
State Universityâ Gentlemen: The Chamber of
Commerce of San Francisco has persistently
enaeavored to foster the maritime commerce
of the port, recognizing the fact that upon
maritime commerce and cheap water trans
portation depends to a great extent the future
prosperity of California. Consequently we
learn with much pleasure that your honor
able board is considering the establishment at
the State university of a department which
we respectfully suggest may be properly
.called "liiQi tjoiUege of . Commerce, Manufac
tures and Navigation." ...",Â»
We add the last designation' for the reason
that in a State with such an extended coast
line as ours navigation is a necessary hand
maid of commerce,' and for further reason that
...we hope .your honorable. board will establish
therein a chair of navigation and nautical as
tronomy, where a practical application of the
science may be made, so that California boys
may be encouraged to adopt a sea life and ex
pect promotion therein by "heme prepared
j lor it. :.-../. * ,*. Â

' â¢â¢""" ~~"
The amateur athletes of this coast are
up in arms against tbe stringent measures
that have been imposed upon them by. the
Amateur Athletic Union of America..
The rules have been bo strict that amateur*
athletics are in a disabled state and it is
doubtful when they can be revived. Four
or five years ago the Olympic Club of this
City could proudly boast of having among
its members sprinters, jumpers and pole
vaulters who were competent to compete
with the champions of America, but the
rulings of the union were so severe that
the athletes became discouraged and
eventually they retired from track and
held sports with the result that tbe
Olympic Club had to close its beautiful
athletic grounds because of the lack of
patronage.
The next step the A. A. If. took was a
fling at the amateur boxers, many of
whom have, within the past year, gone
over to the professionals. â 
Now comes the climax, which is bound
to create no end of trouble in athletic
clubdom. . .?. S ..
According to a special notice sent out in
January to the clubs represented in the
union calling attention to rule 4 relating to
the registration of athletes the foi owing
is a copy of a statement received yester
day by the secretary of the Olympic Club
from the University of Chicago in refer
ence to the position it bas taken in regard
to the registration rules of the A. A..U.,
which went into effect on March lof this
year: - y-:~~7>
The University of Chicago is nominally a
member of the Amateur Athletic Union by
reason. of its membership in the Western In
tercollegiate Athletic Association, which is an
a lied member of the Amateur Athletic Union.
The articles of alliance between the Amateur
Athletic Union and the Western Intercolle
giate Athletic Association provide for direct
representation of the Western Intercollegiate
Athletic Association on the board of governor*
of the Amateur Athletic Union and for dele
gates at all meetings of the Amateur Athletic
Union. -.
In spite of these articles of agreement dur
ing the two or more years of the alliance the
Western Intercollegiate Athletic Association
has had no representation on the board of
governors, nor has it been represented at any
of the meetings of the Amateur Athletic
Union. Therefore the colleges belonging to
the Western Intercollegiate Athletic Associa
tion have had no voice in making the rules by
which they are supposed' to be. governed. In
view of this fact when rules are passed which
are considered unwise or unjust, since the col
leges have uo power to change them their
only alternative is to refuse to abide by them.
Some four weeks ago arrangements were
made by me with the manager of the First
Kegiment Armory Athletic Association for a
dual athletic .meet between- our respective
organizations, which was to have taken place
March 13 in tl)e university gymnasium. My
object lv arranging this meet was largely for
the purpose of promoting and continuing the
Interest in track < and field* sports among the
seventy-six candidates for university athletic
honors as wall us far the purpose of develop
ing- them .by actual experience In . contest
arainst good performers. *.*: â¢
The meet waa to have, been a private Invita
tion affair between these two organizations,
and both sides were greatly interested in it
and eager for the contest. A prize banner
had been ordered and other arrangements
completed when a letter was received from
Mr. R. F. Fishburn, president of the Central
Association of the Amateur Athletic Union,
calling attention to the rule of the Amateur
Athletic Association which went into effect on
March I, requiring all athletes to be registered
before being allowed to compete, on penalty
of disqualification. The basis for the demand
rosted on the definition of "closed" and "open"
meets. â
The university management, not being con
scious that they were bound by other rules
than those in which the university has a part
ln making, most strenuously objected to this
outside interference, and has considered this
Interdict as an assumption of power which
the Amateur Athletic Union does not possess
and which no self-respecting institution will
submit to.
Specifically, the University of Chicago objects
to the rule -which requires all registering
athletes to pay a registration fee of $1.
We object to t As clause because we consider
it an unwise and unnecessary measure. If it
is a scheme to raise money, it is unwise and
unbusinesslike, for no definite sum coultJ bo
counted on from such a source, and unless the
Amateur Athletic Union has an extremely ad
justable budget of expenses which could be ac
commodated to any income, such a plan would
be open to Censure. The tact is, however, that
the Amateur Athletic Union does not need to
make this special individual tax for the pur
pose of meeting its running expenses. The
annual dues are sufficient to cover these, and
it there were need tor further assessment it
were much better to levy direct upon the clubs
themselves, for reasons shown hereafter.' '
.. Secondâ The rule is unwise and unnecessary
and unjust, because if the payment of $1
is required to secure a guaranty of amateur
standing.it savors strongly of the nature of
blackmail levied by | the Amateur Athletic
Union, for it. is like stamping men as amateurs
at $1 a head. The psymentof $1, and thereby
securing a license which guarantees the ath
lete's amateur standing, most certainly will
not make men more really amateurs than tbey
are by their life and record. An amateur
needs no special stamp of approval. He can
riot be marked by any branding-iron with the
honor word "smsteur" blazed across it, and
ho does not need it, . â¢
Thirdâ lt is an unwise rule, because useless,
since it cannot possibly improve the amateur
status of the Amateur Athletic Union mem
bers or non-members, because the rules de
fining an amateur and the rules of participa
tion in contests are rules which govern the
amaleur status of athletes, and these have
been the governing rules in the past.
Again, we consider the rule unjust:
Firstâ Because it the fee specified is in
tended to cover the. cost of registration it is
exorbitant. The expense of registration at
the most cannot be large, Including only the
cost of paper, printing, postage and a little
clerical workâ very small part of the sum.
Farther, why levy a tax of $1 if "one-half of
this sum is to be diverted to the treasury of
the association from which the athlete regis
ters ?" Why turn over half the money to the
association ? Docs the association need it and
has it no power to raise it of itself v Suppose,
too, that the I association pays the athletic ex
penses of Its competing athletes, as nine out of
ten associations do, why need they pay money
into the Amateur Athletic Union when it is
to be returned? It looks like a sop to quiet
opposition.
- Secondâ We consider the rule unjust and
harmful to amateur sports, because it inter
feres iv no small way with the development
of young athletes, whether attached or un
attached to organized clubs. Numbers of
young and aspiring athletes will be kept from
developing an Interest in sports and from de
veloping themselves by reason of the large
registration fee require 1. Young fellows who
have rio special: gift in athletic sports will
think twice before throwing, away $150 or
morn for entrance and registration .fees, in
order to take uneven chances in two or three
contests a year. Likewise the clubs and col
leges will -hesitate to try in contest many men
whom they otherwise would' on account of
the additional expense. -
Again, we object to the definition of a
"closed" meet, as required by the AmatÂ°ur
Athletic Union: '. -
Because it interferes with all private
invitation meets, which are , as strictly
"closed" to all Intents and purposes as though
the members of only one organization took
part. Under the present rule no organization
can invite a single outsider to compete in , its
home games without securing sanction for the
meet, and requiring each competitor to be
registered. V. Â.â¢;.*,-..' â¢: o- â¢. ...-*.-â¢ â¢'â¢. -Â â¢-*-;

ATHLETES WILL WITHDRAW
Berkeley Men of Muscle to Secede
From the Pacific Coast Asso- .
elation. XX'Xm
BERKELEY, Cal., April 1. â Seces
sion by the University of California ath
letes from the Pacific Coast Athletic Asso
ciation is imminent. They have made
known tbeir intention to the executive
committee of the association; but no
definite action has been taken in the mat
ter by either of the parties. Trouble be
tween the association and the 1 Berkeley
men has been brewing for some time over
what the collegians declare to be an out
rageous requirement on the part of the
association. '
Recently a motion was carried by the
association requiring that in addition to
the yearly dues of $10 from the univer
sity each athlete nn: i pay a registration
fee of $1 before entering a contest. This
$1 fee is. declared by the Berkeley men to
be a premium on amateurism and an un
necessary ourden. Being a member of
the Mott Haven Association and of the
Western Intercollegiate, the Berkeley men
say that they have complied with all the
requirements of amateur athletes, and
tbat the tax of $1 each which has been
levied will do them no good, and is hence
a waste of good money. -Â'
Baid a member of the U. C. executive
committee to-day: "This dissension on
our. part lias been developing for. some
time past. In fact, the association has
been graduelly going to pieces for a year

No woman, can look fresh and fair who is suffering from displacement of :
the womb. It is ridiculous to suppose that such a difficulty can be cured by
an artifical support like a pessary. - - . .'Xyy'^yy â 'â  â  'XXXjyXX-y

"[ for two years I could not walk across the floor. I ] also had , pro-
fuse menstruation, kidney, liver, and stomach trouble. The doctors said my " :
case was hopeless: I had taken only four bottles of the Vegetable Compound
and one of the Blood Purifier when I felt like a new person. '- I am now cured,
much to the surprise of my friends, for they all gave me up to die. Now many
of my lady friends are using Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound through .
my recommendation and are regaining health. It has also cured my little son â 
of kidney trouble. I would advise "suffering woman in the land to write;

or more. The boxers and wrestlers have
long; wanted us out or to have a club of
their own. They think: .that college men
are a species of fresh-water, or as some
people call us, lady athletes, because we
do not got in and scrap every time we
meet. They seem to think that bruising
is athletics. That is just where college
athletes and sporting athletes differ. ..The
boxers have felt that more prominence
should be given to their branch. And so
when this extra tax of $1 was imposed the
climax was capped, and we threatened to
withdraw. I think the fee is meant to be
a bluff to raise money for paving the ex
penses of the association. - Since we an
nounced our purpose of withdrawing the
association has offered to waive the $1
clause, but as a principle is at stake be
sides the money consideration, we will
probably withdraw any way." .

.. ." Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V., April 2.â Stocks in the
main were-firmer to-day. At Intervals the mar
ket was inclined to heaviness on sales by the
chronic bears, but at the end of the session the
usually active issues showed gains of i i@l3' per
cent on the day, Delaware and Hudson, Jersey
Central and Leather **Â£ per cent."
The improvement ln the market was due more
to a desire on the part of the recent sellers to ac
cept profits than to any material change in the
situation. Reports of the arrival of prominent
American bankers and railway men in London,
including J. P. Morgan and President Hill of the-
Great Northern, appeared to discredit the bear
rumors, especially as there were rumors of Im
â . portant deals pending.
It was said thai Morgan would take up the New
"S ork Central refunding scheme once, and that
the meeting of the representatives of the Northern
Pacific Great Northern Deutsche Bank interests
was for the purpose of bringing about a close
working agreement be: ween the roads traversing
the Pacific Northwest, 'lhe anthracite coalers
were benehtea by official statemen s that lne Jer
sey Central will not pass lis dividend. Western
t'nion was also influenced by dividend rumors.
The stock early in the day broke to 80, but later
â¢ recovered the greater part of the lo.s. Director
Sage was quoted as saying that ui.lejs business
Improves considerably he will certainly favor a
redncrlon In the dividend rate to a 4 per cent
, basis. .The grangers, Northern Pacific preferred

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., April There was abetter
feeling evinced by wheat at the opening this
morning tban was in evidence at the close yes er
day, mainly for the reason that Liverpool failed
to accord recognition of our appreciation of that
day. Northwestern receipts were not as great as
they have been, amounting to but 298 cars,
against 488 last Friday. The lightening up of the
movement in that section- contributed to the
opening firmness. - Receipts at Chicago were nine
cars, aud 38.550 bushels wers taken from store.
The market exhibited a generally steady to firm
tone throughout, though the business was not
large, nor wcie the fluctuations broad. Closing
cables were irregular. May heat opened from
705 8 c to 7034 c sod between 70"*/ 8 i- and 71 .
closing at 70%ftt71c. Sfcigi/jc higher than yester

No. 2 red, spot, wheat ranged from 863 8 c to 90c,
closing about 87Â®90c
CORNâ The action In corn early was quite not
able. The feeling was strong and there was eood
buying both by shorts and for Investment. The
undertone wai considered promising and the im
mediate situation encouraging Toward the close,
however, offerings increased and prices receded
under the aeiling. Ma- corn opened at.26@2s^fec.
sold between li'.ijc and 24tys@24Sic. clo-ln^ at
24% c. i,ic under yesterday- Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 147 cars.

early Improvement noticed elsewhere. It was
firm enough to advance somewhat and offerings
were but moderate making prices somewhat
higher. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 174

animated enough to attract a crowd, and outsiie
of. local professional and packing interests the
attendance In tbe pit was light. Firm hogs
caused steady to firm product values. Later on

tle recelp a this week will amount to about 45.000
head, against 47.010 last week and 28.800 a year
ago. ' As a rule prices of beer cattle have no*, un
dergone any markei change, and the fact that
fewer steer 1 are selling at extremely low price 1 is
accounted for by the improved quality c' the
offerings. To-day trade was slow ani prices ruled
weak in a good many instances.
j Hogs bave been well taken during ths week,
end the off -rings, although much larger than last
week, nave not been excessive. Chicago took all
the hogs It could obtain. Prices have not changed
much, and averaged to-day only a few cents lower
man a week ago. :-.â -:
The demand for fat sheep and lambs is un
abated, and both have been selling this week at
the highest price of the year. The market today '

BUN'S KEVIKW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. N. V., April 2.-B. G. Dun &
Ca will say to-morrow in their weekly review of
trade: Failures reported to-day for the first quar
ter of 897 number 3992, against 4031 last year:
with liabilities of 548.007,911 against $57,425,135
last year. Â . ,
The markets are still waiting, some sagging
downward and others recovering. . There is much
disposition . to use the decision of 'the Supreme
Court against railroad combinations as an Instru
ment, for depressing stocks, and 'yet the buying
has prevented a decline- exceed ing fii per share
and tor trust st (.ks -.0 cents per share. > .; â - - ..-;
J he reports of. raljr. ad earnings for the quarter
have bee u somewhat encouragntv, the segregate
having been on roads wltnin the United states
only 3.2 per cent sma ler than last year, and the
March I returns , have bee 1 rather more favor,
than before January or February. ...:..'...
â¢ The vote of â¢ the House in favor of a new tariff
bill has made 1.0 impression in business since it
has been expected since Nov-rober that s some'
measure of tbe same general character won d be
come a law. fit the bill stands with Its provision
making new duties applicable April 1 the chances
are that foreign Imports sand ueasury receipts
may be Cor a time considerably restricted. The
market for products has been variable and uncer
tain. Wheat closes a cent â¢ lower tban last week,
and the May option has: declined 2 cents, and
Western receipts for the week have been 2.781,
--657 bushels against 1.951,206 last year, while the
Atlantic exports, flour Included, have been 2,185 -
278 bushels against 1,2e0.013 last year. - ,i .-.*â,. ;.'. *
The movement of corn continues so large as to
materially 1 fleet the demand for l wheat. Western
receipts having been 1,913,862 bushels for tbe

week, agai st 1. 946,045 . last year, and Atlantic
exports 4,291,629, against 1,065,396 last year.
Current trade estimates regarding the wheat crop
area, are a little ni' re favorable and somewhat
more liable to prove profitable as the -advance of
I the season makes the condition of growing wheat
I better. ' Cotton has not changed, although the
| floods in the southwest have doubtless) done much
j harm.' The co.ton and other textile manufactures
I Â»**â  slowly valuing lv business, though print
j cloths and most staple cottons remain- unchanged
in price and restrictions of output seem to have
given some relief to the market- Ihe buying of
wool by mills Is still a notewor.hy feature, being
far in excess of current consumption, but there Is
a much : greater volume of transactions between
dealers, and at the three chief markets the sales
for five weeks have been 63,725,200 poun Is,
against 25,377,670 in the same wteksof .1892,
when the mills were well employed. Prices are
very strong, both here and at Lon ton. ;
The iron aud steel Industry has been staggered,
so io speak, by the decision of the Supreme Court
affecting railroads, since It Is apprehended that
purchases not. only of rails but of oars, locomo
tives and bridge materials may be affected. The
dcm.ii d- for rail* is still considerable, and one
order is pending for 10.000 tons for Japan, but the
reduction in Mesaba ore with the want of agree
ment as yet among produce! of bard ores tends
to encourage the belief In lower prices for finished
products and so to hinder buying. '1 he ereal
strut gle between the -producing companies nt
M~saoa has not yet so far developed that anybody
can feel confident as to the future cosl'of iron.
M .-an while, with pig accumulating, although some
furnaces' have s opped production, the price of
Bessemer at Pittsburg Is a shade lower at 910 25
and gray forge' at $9. but there are no quotable
changes in .prices of finished products, although
the tone is rather weak. The new combination in
cut nails only affects selling prices iv Eastern
market*.

WOOL-Jacob Woilner's circular says: "We
have a very lively market and It reminds us of old I
times, when buyers watched every load of Wool I
that came In and tried to get the first chance at it. |
Prices are advancing a d Wool Is worth fuliv lc fi
ft more to-day than It was v weeic ago It is a 1
speculatlv, ss the em and 1- tiro pea 11 markets
do not justify prices paid. Most of the Wools com
ing in now have been bought In the country. Very
Utile Wool is coming in to be so.d on commission.
The arrivals are not so large as they generally are
at this time of the year. The Wools that have
I come in so far are In excellent condition, but the
rain somewhat retarded shearing. If wo have nice
weather Wools will be coming ln more freely. if
the senate will pass the House bill and adopt its 'â 
amendment that the tariff bill shall go into effect
on April 1: we w 11 have a' steady market in the
future, and It would shut off all forel n Wools that
cou d be rushed in if the tariff bill did not go into
effect until .ater on. . Of course It is bard to fore
tell what the Senate will do. especially for Wool
and woolens A . cablegram from London to-day
says that only one American buyer had the hardi
hood to buy Wool and the balance withdrew, and
in consequence prices are easier.'' -

'* a.ntee: The -charier provides that the J
schoolteachers shall be elected every June
.for a period of one year, and no teacher is
/'absolutely certain that he or she may not
be discharged at - theend of the year. At

' -years, there Lave been many sudden and

" there were many surprises.
Now, as June approaches, the spirit of
unrest is again apparent. .It exists in a

"'â¢ fact that many of the teachers have served
' in. the department over twenty years and
' are naturally. anxious to know that they j
will- be retained long enough to entitle |
. them to a pension. None of them have

Alniiip'ians Who Are Anxious to Draw
Salaries From the General Govern

ALAMEDA, Cal.', April 2. â Besides
Judge Waymire, who is a candidate for a
very prominent position under tbe Mc-
Kinley administration, there are several
Alamedans who fancy that they are fit to
adorn a Federal office with a fat salary at

mastership, and for that position there
are half a dozen candidates. Included in
the number are E. A. Itandlett, T. W.
lveydecker, Stuart M. Taylor, C. W. Berry
and Charles M. Culver, with Dr. McLean in
tije background as a very targe and very
threateningdark horse. It has been thought
that Mr. Kandiett was the favorite, but
since it became known that Dr. McLaan
had an eye on the office his chances are
not regarded as so aood. A. B. Hunt,
Sam Frank, Frans Webb, L. A. Phillips,
W. H. Noy, George Lovcgrove and Several
others bave their eyes on various posi
tions which will serve to tide over the
next four years, but the conservatives are
of the opinion that if Jud^e Waymire gets
an appointment that will be about tbe ex

J hr Library Trustee Bill.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 2.â The news
tbat Governor Budd bad signed tbe
library trustee bill was received with
pleasure here by many and the opposite
I feeling by others. The origin of this bill
! was the memorable library row of two
i years ago, when a futile attempt was made
|to oust the librarian by force. The same
I elements that were behind that movement
antagonized this bill, and as they were
quite influential it was for some time
problematical whether the Governor would
sign the bill' or not.' Almost as much hard
work was done in trying to induce him to
sign it on the one band and to pocket it
on the other as *vas required to get it
through the Legislature. ' But the matter
is settled now, and the present manage
ment ot the library is correspondingly
happy. _' ; -

largely due to the publicity given to the
results of the test;.
The milkmen are considerably dis
! turbed over the rumor that a combination
which is supplying San Francisco and

j about to extend its operation to this city.

Strange Confession of Jim. Baumgarten
Made iv Open Court.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 2.â The Baum
gartens were in Judge Ellsworth's court
to-day, and as a large proportion of the
population south of Seventh street answers
to the name of Baumgarten, when the
family gees into court tbere is not much
room for anybody else.
The present struggle is over the prop
erty, and his wife made things decidedly
amusing by telling how the old. junk
dealer made love to her. She told, the
court it took him a whole year to get
around putting the question, and after
this she swore that the only reason she
married him was because be promised to
deed her certain property as soon as the
marriage was performed.
He promised her a house on Third
street, and in her testimony Mrs. Baum
garten scored quite a point. She drew her
self up in an attitude ot disgust, pointed
tbe finger of scorn at her aged husband
and said, "I wouldn't have married that
.man under any circumstances if I thought
he was not gome to give me tbat house,"
and everybody who witnessed the incident
believed what she said.
Baumgarten, according to the testi
mony, deeded his property to a friend for
the purpose of defrauding bis wife. She
brought suit for divorce, which is now
pending, andfeince it is tiled the old man
has served two or three terms of varying
length in the City Prison for refusing to
support bis wife and infant child. -

Mrs. Miuni3 Lee Has Only One Re
gret for the F^ts of the Wretch
S'je MarneJ' '">;Â»'
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
. 908 Broadway, April 2. j
News was received to-day concerning
two unfortunate brides. In one instance
it was pood news, and in the other its
quality might be called doubtful. ''
The friends of Mrs. 0 lie Rourke, who
suddenly became insane while in this city
a f:w days after her marriage two months
ago, received the gratifying information
MRS. OLLIE ROURKE, the Beautiful Bride Whose Reasoa Has Returned, and MRS. MINNIE
LEE, Whose Wealthy Husband Will Spend Twenty Years in San Quentin.
that the young lady has now almost re
covered and will probably soon be in good
health again. \ \XXX>XX
Mrs. Minnie Lee, or D.ehl, received the
news that her husband, John G. Lee, had
been sentenced in Los Angeles to twenty
years in State's pri-on. To Mrs. Lee the
information was almost welcome, and
were it not for the fact that the man is the
father of ber little child it would have
been entirely so.
Mrs. Rourke, it will be remembered, is
a young lady 22 years old, who came to
Oakland just after her marriage to a
thrifty Colusa farmer. While brooding
over religious belief she suddenly became
a raving maniac. Prior to her marriage
she bad been a Protestant and Rourke
was a Catholic. She embraced his faith
before the wedding day, aud it is pre
sumed that a reconsideration of her deter
mination to change her religion was
partly responsible for the unhinging of
tier mind. PÂ£Ms
Since she left Oakland the young bride
has been carelully attended to at Napa
Asylum.- A few days ago she had recov
ered sufficiently to be permitted to go
home, Her mind is now almost clear,
and it is believed tbat with careful nurs
ing and the pleasant surroundings of ber
home it will not be long before she is the
same bright, intelligent, happy young
woman she was before the unpleasant oc
currence.
Mrs. Diehl, who is not yet 20. was mar
ried when she was 17 to John Lee, whom
she thought was an honest Oakland back
man. Before the birth of their child he
deserted her, after proving that be was
one of the crudest of husbands and, so far
as she could ascertain, a bigamist, not
baying been divotced from his first wife
in San Francisco.
She next heard of him in Lot Angeles
when he was arrested fur a felonious
assault on a young girl, for which he was
sentenced yesterday. In the meantime
she brought, suit for divorce, but tempo
rarily withdrew it when it became known
that her husband is an heir to tbe estate
of Antonio Schiappi. Hoping* to obtain
soiii<* portion of the estate lor herself and
child, she is awaiting developments, and
but for the reason already stated is some
what pleased at Lee's sentence.
COLLEGIANS WHO WORK.
Students at Berkeley Diving* on 95
a Month.
BERKELEY. Cai.., April I.â The direc
tors of thii Students' Aid Society of the
university .will meet next Monday even
ing, when they will discuss plans for a
considerable extension of the work of the
organization. There are more students
supporting themselves in Berkeley at tie
present time than ever before in tne his
tory of tbe university, and the amount of
work accomplished by the aid society in
helling tnem to secure employment
during the college year is far in advance
of the record for any previous year. Ac
cording to Professor Rising, president of
tbe society, there are students living on
$5 per 'month, while they carry on ad
vanced studies, and there are many who
nave to be at work from early morning
far into the night in order to keep body
and soul together, and -at the same time
keep up tbeir college standing. ,
â : ."One suggestion for an increase of the
usefulness of the society," said Professor
Rising, "is that a" kitchen and dining
room of the Students' Aid Society be es
tablished for the many collegians who do
tbeir own cooking. In some cases ' these
live very poorly. _ A few day ago our at
tention was directed to a student who was
unable to pay his dues for suits in the
physical culture department. We com
municated with Pres>uent Kellogg and
the matter was arranged. On investiga
tion we found that tbe boy was: not only
supporting himself, but was assisting very
materially in keeping his roommate. Tbe
two cook their own meals. In the morn
ing tbey have something warm, and for
tbe rest of the day cold remains suffice.,..:
. "There are many such of both sexes.
Were : a club or dining-room established
they could live much better than they do
for the same cost or less. ]
"In the university are students who do
not get $5 a month. , Of course, such are
very much handicapped i i their, college
work. One who has id do so much out
side cannot give a desirable amount of
attention to study, and, moreover,- the
mind that is so full of worries and anxiety
over an uncertain future is not in proper
condition for university work." 'â ?'

Board of Regents spent this afternoon in
consultation with President Kellogg and
the beads of departments at Berkeley re
garding the location of -the new building
to be erected on the grounds and the ad
ditions tbat are to be made to old ones.
It was decided to locate the new structure
behind the library, a short distance in
front of the chemistry building, and to
construct additions to the buildings now
occupied by the departments of agricul
ture, mining and physical culture, the
total cost of the improvements to be
$35,000. ; ;;>-.
T c new building will be erected at once
and will cost about $20,000. It is to con
tain two laboratories for the physics de
partment and a biological laboratory, six- i
teen classrooms, an assembly-room for
students and a meeting place for co-eds.
Clinton Day is the architect and will pre
sent plans at the next meeting of the re
gents. It is proposed to have the build-
done for the opening of the next
college year. A large freshman class is
expected and additional room will be re
quired at once, especially. the new wing
for the gymnasium.
Professor Howtson of the department of
philosophy desires a building apart for his
clas e-. Much of the work of the depart
ment, especially that fit the psychology
classes, requires a separate edifice, but as
yet the regents have not decided to provide
one. .
The committee on buildings consists of

Nothing N w Remains to the Widow
'.-. bnt ths Memory of a Happy, ..v
Opubnt Past. \
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 2. ,
A mortgage for $40,000 was recently
closed against the estate of the late Israel
Knox of this city, and it marks the close
of an estate that was noticeable for the
rapid manner in which it rose to riches
and comfort and as suddenly fell to
poverty and misfortune. '.XX.X.X.
Nearly thirty years ago Israel Knox was
one of the most flourishing capitalists of
this city. He owned a considerable estate,
embracing a large portion of toe territory
in tho vicinity of Telegraph avenue and
Twenty-seventh street. The property was
known all over the Stale by reason of the
Field Seminary, which was located there
until, a few years ago and from which
graduated many of the daughters of the
wealthiest lamilies in California. . . â j -X
.At a time when California mme i were
in some cases turning out fortunes for
their owners Knox was prevailed upon to
make a bold stroke and to invest his whole
fortune in a hole in the ground.
Like many other bold speculators, the
investor soon .'discovered that the mine
was valueless. He mortgaged everything
to get more money to try to get treasures
from the earth, and in the midst of bis
operations, death, overtook him, and he
left his affairs in a hopeless tangle.
The estate has since been in ceaseless
litigation, and little by little it has fallen
fropi the grasp of the family. The fore
closure of the last mortgage of $40,000 by
the Hinernic Savings Bank of San Fran
cisco marks the close of the estate.
The widow still lives, but she has saved
ho more from the general wreck than a
bare subsistence for the rest of her days.
Like her husband, Mrs. Knox was also
very generous, and whenever an appeal
for aid was made she responded liberally.
Now the old lady is in a position where
she needs the sympathy of all of her
friends. ,'-'.â¢'- = â  .â .â -â 'â â XX:-.'J':yXi'-..-.
GUARDIAN WELCH BOOKED.
Judge Coffey Sara There Has Been
Gross Neglect of Duty.
Secretary Charles W. Welch of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was
severely condemned by Judge Coffey yester
day, and it was ordered that his letters of
guardianship in the case of little Emily Guille
met be revoked.
The matter has attracted much attention on
account of the unusual cruelty of the father of
the girl and the viieness of his conduct. It
was shown that Guillemet was known by all
the officers to be an unfit person to have the
custody of his child.
When Mr. Welch was called to the witness
stand he testified that he heard that the young
girl was grieving for her father, and so he
exercised his authority as her legal guardian
and ordered her released from the Florence
Crittenden Home, so that she could go back to
her father's residence. He subsequently saw
the girl there with her lather and a woman
with whom her father was consorting. He re
gretted to say that both Guillemet and Emily
have disappeared and that he has no idea where
he could find his ward. ,*
Judge Coffey. was indignant. He declared
that Mr. Welch had violated his duty as a man
and as an officer aud had disobeyed the orders
of the court. .* .
"Mr. Welch had no right to deliver his ward
to any person or to remove her from the asy
lum to which she had been sent by the court,"
said Judpe Coffey. "He knew what 1 thought
of the fatherâ a scoundrel who consorted with
the lowest of people and frequented dens of
j infamy; a man who convicted himself out of
| his own mouthâ and, "above all things, Mr.
Welch should not have intrusted that child to
1 the custody of the father, who ought not to be
permitted to remain on the fare of | the earth.
I'll have to revoke the letters on the testimony
I of p Mrs. Russell, matron of the Crittenden
. Home, and of Mr. Welch himself. I wouid like
' to gel the little girl back." :â¢-.-:

CONTRACT WORK LEGAL
State Bindings Need Not Be
Constructed Only by Day
Labor.
â¢â â . :;**;â  -
The Attorney-General's Opinion on
the New Harbor Structure
Case.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald ' has ' sent
his opinion on tbe question of contract
labor on the new harbor building and tbe
Affiliated Colleges buildings to Deputy
Labor Commissioner Cleveland L. Dam.
As will be seen by the opinion which fol
lows Mr. Fitzgerald is of the opinion that
section 3233 of the Political Code is no
longer in effect, and that therefore the
system is perfectly legal:
; Sacramento, Cal., March 26, 1897.
Hon. E. L. Fitzgerald. Labor Commissioner, 325
Sutter Street, San Francisco, ( al.â Dear Mr: I
am in receipt of your favor of the 24th inst.,
in which you ask "whether or not sect. 3233
of the Political Code is still in effect, and, if so,
whether 1 1 has any bearing upon existing con
tracts for State work?"
The section in question is one of the original
ions of "An act to establish a Political
Code." approved March 12, 1872, and is as
follows: ,'
"All work done upon the public buildings of
this State must be done under the supervision
of a superintendent' or Stale officer or officers
having charce of the work, ana all labor em
ployed on such buildings, whether skilled or
unskilled, must be employed by the day, and
no work upon any of such buildings must be
done by contract."
It has never been expressly repealed. How
ever, on April 1; 1872. "An act to regulate the
erection of public buildings and structures"
was approved, which expressly authorized the
erection of State as we. l as county and other
pubic buildings by con tract's 1871-72,
page 925); and,- as was held in -Babe ock vs.
Goodrich, 47 Cul., at page 510, and as provided
by sections 4478 and 4479 of the Political
Code, that law prevailed over the section
under consideration. Furthermore, on March
23, 1876, "an act to regulate contracts on De
hall of the State in relation to erections and
bul. dings," was approved; and section 15 of
that act is as follows: "All acts and parts of
acts In conflict with the provisions of this act
are nereby repealed." (Statutes 1875-76. pages
427, et seq.) . This act, portions of which w-xe
amended in' lÃ9l (statutes 1891, page 457;,
and again ln 1895 (statutes 1895, page 237,)
expressly, authorizes the letting of contracts
for the erection of public buildings of the
State; and necessarily repeals section 3233 of
the Political Code. - â¢
1 am, therefore, of the opinion that section
2233 of the Political Code is no longer 111
effect: and that "existing contracts for State
work." other than that done by the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners, are regulated
b> the acts of 1872 and 1876 tbove referred
to, or such portions of those acts as are still
in force. The Harbor Commission is con
trolled in the erection of. buildings under Its
supervision by those provisions of the Politi
cal Code which relate spe-iflcally to that
board (Bateman vs. Colgan, 111 Ca1., 580), with
the single exception that section 3 of the act
of 1876 was, by the amendment 0f|1895, made
to apoly to contracts let by it. (Stats. 1895,
p. 238.) Respectfully. ,

A Winter Bath in White River.
What lime of Freak ing Through the Ice
in a Wisconsin River in February.
From the Chronicle, Chicago, 111.
Five years ago last winter there was consid
erable commotion on the banks of tbe White
River, Wisconsin, as a young man named K. >'.
Halleck bad broken through the Ice and was
fur some moments lost to view. It was not
long, however, before Mr. Halleck came in
bight again, and by artistic means was fished
from the fluid and restored to society. - If the
ducking bad been all it would have been well,
but, unfortunately, the young gentleman con
tracted a heavy cold, resulting in chronic
rheumaiism, complicated with disease of kid
ney and urinary organs.
"For six months," writes Mr. Halleck, "I
was laid up and not able to do anything. Dar
ing this time I suffered with pains, in the
stomach and small of the back and headache,
urination was' frequent and ' pniniui, my
heart's action was creased, and I nad aches
all over my body and was generally used up.
Then I was able to go oat, but was a con
firmed Invalid, and for nearly tour years I was
in that condition, ana expected then that I
should always bo disabled, for nothing that I
took gave me any relief.
'â¢In December. 1895, I read an advertise
ment about Pink Pills, and on speaking of il
to Mrs. A. Â£. D rby, she strongly urged that I
should lake them, as she believed they would
cure me. I had been under physicians' care
lor over two years, but as they d.d me no good
I did not ask their advice about taking Pink
Pi. ls, and .aid in a supply and commenced to
take them. In ab >vi ten days I began to ex
perience substantial relief, and continued. to
take Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People
for lour months, by which time- 1 was cured.
The first benefit I obtained was a less frequent
desire to annua-, and lessening of that dread""
ful pain in tbe*back, which ceased altogether
very soon. ;. My stomach", became comfortable,
and my heart's action normal. .After the first
break ray recovery was rapid, and to-d*y I
flatter myself lam a sound man, and able to
attend to my business better- than 1 ever
could before." , .

A LAW THAT ACTS
LIKE A BOOMERANG
. Method of Collecting Taxes
. Diagnosed for the
Grand Jury.
The New System Costs This
â¢ City $40,000 More Than
the 0:d.
ThÂ« Lab r of Collecting Small Sams
Is Out of All P, opor to
the Amount
- Aurelius E. Buckingham, H. N. Hanne
niann and H. W. VVestpbal. composing
the committee of the Grand Jury on the
lax Collector's office, bled a report with
' tfie jury yesterday that presents a striking
picture of the workings of the new law re
â - quiring the collection of personal prop
erty taxes on demand by the Assessor.
The law has been represented as clumsy
. and cumbersome In its operations, but to
this criticism the committee gives figures
showing that it fails entirely of its aim to
gather in more money than did the pre
vious law; that, instead, it is very expen
sive and causes loss rather than gain. The
report is as follows :
San Francisco. Cal., March 27, 1897.
To the Honorable Grand Jury of the City and
County of San Francisco; In relation to uelin
queni personal property taxes it appears from
investigation that the number ol delinquents
ji:> to and including tbe fiscal year 1594-95
â¢ averages about 18,500; that in the year
1895-96 the number of the delinquents was
apparently reduced to 14,250. Inis reduc
tion is in reality not a real one for the reason
that in the spring of 1895 the Assessor of the
City and Couniy of San Francisco proceeded
'-to collect taxes under the revenue law passed
by the Legislature of this State early in the
.spring of that year; that that law required
the Assessor to collect the taxes upon alt per
sonal property where, in his opinion, the
owner of said personal property did not own
sufficient real estate to guarantee the pay
. ment of the taxes. Â«
. â  This law a.so imposed a personal liability
upon the Assessor in case he failed to collect
such taxes. As a result a great many corpora
â¢ tions which had been carried on the roll year
after year, and which had long ceased to do
any business and had really gone out of exist
ence, were omitted- from the roll of 1895-96
and which appeared on a.i former rolls. The
"Assessor further omitted a number of persons
.who might be called chronic delinquents
that it, persons who have been assessed year
after year and had refused to pay their taxes.
'This, together with the fact thai the Assessor
made very few arbitral y assessments, accounts
for the apparent decrease in the number of de
linquents.
We wish to call your attention to the state
of affairs which is likely to exist in the com
ing year. The rate on personal property taxes
for this last fiscal year, to wit: 1896-97,
was about 1.40 on a hundred, while the rate
for the succeeding year iÂ« reasonably certain
to be at least 1.45. In 1898-97 there were,
-in round numbers-. 31,000 taxpayers in San
Francisco, whose taxes were collected by the
Assessor. If the same number is collected
from for the fiscal year 1897-98 each of
'these 31,000 people wiil be required to go to
.the City Hall and pay the difference in the
'rate, i. c., about 5 cents on each $100 of valu
ation. In the fiscal year 1895-96â the first
. year in which this law was put 111 forceâ about
8500 people became delinquent for the differ
â  ence caused by the change in rate trom one
year to the other.
If in 1897-98 the same ratio would continue
.(and there is every reason to tifink that it will
be larter), each person paying on a basis of
$100 in valuation would become delinquent
say for 5 cents.- Five percent of that must be
added at the latter part of November as a pen
' alty, and 15 per cent of the same 5 cents must
be added as a penalty in the latter part of
Anril. In June, this balance still remaining
unpaid, it must by law be advertised, at a
- charge of 15 cents to each delinquent. The
law require?, further than this, that postal
cards must ba sent to each taxpayer, notify
ing him of the amount which is due from htm
because of the change in -the rate irom which
they have paid and which has been fixed.
.-These postal cards must be ten 1 out by the Tax
Collector some time along' about the first ot
November, lf the taxes are not paid the Tax
. Collector must, about the first of June, send out
another postal card notifying them of the de
linquency and that tbe same must be paid.
. Tbe cost of postal cards on a 5-ceut delin
quency is of itself, including printing, about
Â 2*4 cents. This, 01 course, does not include
the clerical labor necessary to write out and
send these postals.
It will thus be seen that a person paying
' upon a basis of $100 would become delinquent
for 5 cents, to which a penalty of 20 per cent,
to wit, 1 cent, is added. This, when adver
tised, Incurs an additional expense of 50 cents,
â¢ making the charge upon a person who tries to
pay bis taxes 51 cents in order to pay 5 cents,
It this tax is paid just prior to its advertise
ment, the City wi.l actually lose four or five
â¢ times the amount of the tax in the cost of
carrying said amount on the books aud of
notifying the person of his delinquency.
In 1894-95 almost naif of the persons delin
quent were assessed for an amount under $100.
â¢â¢ According to the statements of the Auditor
costs the City and County forty thousand
($40,000) dollars more to collect its taxes
under the present system than it did prior to
the enactment of tho revenue law in 1895,
while tbe results are not in reality as good.
The amount of personals property taxes paid
" to the Assessor of the City and County of San
Francisco is 45 per cent larger than. the
amount paid in ail the other counties of tbe
State. The Assessors in other counties than
Ban Francisco retain, as compensation for
making such collections, 6 per cent, and the
. amount that would be= due to the Assessor of
.this City and County upon said basis would be
$9000. It can easily be seen, therefore, that
if such a thing were possible it would result
in a saving to the City ana County if the Leg
islature of this State would allow this City and
County to collect its taxes as it formerly did
of some $35,000, and yet pay the commission
allowed the Assessors in all the othjrjcountles.

SAYS HE
KILLED
PRESTON
Butler at Last Tells a
,; Little of His \
Crimes.
DECLARES IT WAS SELF
DEFENSE.
Claims He Fears a Forgery
Charge More Than That
of Murder.
THE TALE TOLD BY DEPUTY
SHERIFFS.
M de Apprehensive Over His Coming
'X Departure, Butler Attempted
Suicide '
"I killed Arthur Preston, but I did it in
self-defense," is the startling confession
that Murderer Butler made to a Deputy"
Sheriff in the County Jail on Thursday
nigbt. '-''''
It was the first time he had admitted
that he was in any way concerned in the
killing of the unfortunate men whose
deaths are laid at his door, and the con
fession was all the more startling because
it came unsolicited from the lips that
have, ever since the irÂ«n clutches of the
law fell on Butler on the Swanhilda,
maintained their owner's innocence.
Butler has told many tales to explain
the deaths of tnoae who went out into the
Blue Hills in' his company and were seen
no more until their decomposed bodies
were found in shallow pits, where tbey
were delving for gold when the murder
er's bullets found their viials. lsa**jl
Sometimes he said that there were three
or four in the party and that otters mur
dered the unfortunates while be was out
prospecting, and that for fear of his life
he was compelled to keep silent and flee
when the search for the victims was be
gun. At other times he has denied that
he knew of the death of the men, and
often declared that they were alive and
he could prove it.
At no time would he admit that his
steady band and cruel eye directed the
fatal bullets that ended their lives.
His story regarding Arthur Preston
has been, since he beard of the finding of
the young man's body and up to the
Thursday night's confession, that his com
panions murdered Preston and that they
ad hidden bis dead body. He had taken
a portion of Preston's effects because at
the time he thought Preston had left the
party and gone off by himself.
Now that the day of his departure has
arrived he has weakened, and admits one
killing.
The guards who have been with him in
the lonely watches of tne night have
noticed 'that he seemed anxious to tell
something but seemingly feared to do so.
Often he has started to discuss the deaths
of Weller and Preston, but has broken off
without giving the information that eager
ears were waiting for.
On the night mentioned, while he sat
on the edge of his bed gazing into va
cancy, the strain seemed to become too
great, and when the subject of his de
parture to-day was mentioned he' blurted
out tbe words, "I killed Arthur Preston."
. The deputies sat silent, for their expe
rience with criminals has been that wnen
once the ice is broken the whole story,
whether true or false, will be told if the
criminal is allowed to go on without in
terruption.
. "Yes, I killed him," resumed Butlei,
"but I had to do it to save myself. I ad
vertised for a mate with mining experi
ence, and Preston answered it. He
claimed to have done some work in the
mining business, and I did not ask him
many questions.
"We went into the Blue Hills and pros
pected for a while in a locality I thought
ought to produce something, and then
moved to another place.
."Here we had no better success, and
Preston began to grow impatient. - I had
found by this time that he knew nothing
whatever about prospecting, and when he
proposed to move further north I refused,
because I knew that there was no gold in
that direction. Then he became angry
and said be would leave me and go on
bis own hook.
â  "1 was perfectly satisfied, for he was no
use to me, but I was angry, too, at the
way be talked and told him that be bad
deceived me about his qualifications as a
miner.
"We parted that night to search in dif
ferent directions ior gold, and were to
camp together at night for the last time.
When we came together again at dusk he
was ugly and wanted to know why I had
brought him to a place where there was
no gold: I told him to go back if he did
not like it and he grew. furious.
*'o<ie word led to another.-and then he
reached for his gun. My rifle was stand
ing close at hand and 1 grabbed it and
â¢ .fired hastily at him.
v"The bullet struck hi ai in the nose and
..went through his head and he fell dead.
' "I was very much frightened at the re
sulted the quarrel, for though I knew that
I was justified I bad no witnesses to prove
my innocence of murder. I concluded
that the best thing to do was to hide tbe
body and leave tbe country, which I did,
digging a hole the next morning and plac
cing it in tbe position that it was found.
As God it my witness I fired in self-de
fense,' and would not have done so had he
not tried to draw bis gun on me.
"As to Weller,' I do not know just how

he died, but I feel sure he committed sui
cide. He was one of a patty in which I
was traveling, and he was very gloomy
over the death of his wife, who bad died a
short time before under peculiar circum
stances. He kept apart, by himself roost
of the time, and one night when he did
not return to the party we stared out to
search for him. ,
"We found the body on a hillside with
his revolver beside it and a bullet-hole
through the head. I wanted to report the
case to the authorities, but the rest were
against it, saving/that it would only re
sult in our being detained as witnesses
and prevent the prospecting tour on which
we had started. ".
"It was finally agreed to bury the body
and divide his effects among the party.
The articles that were found on me and in
my baggage when I got hereon the Swan
hilda represented my share. I thought it
was time to leave the country because of
these deaths that might lead to my arrest
for Preston's, killing, but I had another
motive that was far more to the point.
"I knew that I could clear myself of any
charges that might be brought against me
growing out of the case of Preston and
Weller, but a short time before I had
forged a check on a Melbourne bank for
Â£5000 and I felt sure that I could be con
victed of obtaining money on it. It meant
twenty years if I was found guilty, and 1
fled more from tbe fear of that than for
anything else. -Is-V
"I can and will beat the murder
charges, but the forgery case is a bad job
and I will get a heavy sentence. These
detectives know of this matter and that it
is tbe strongest case against me, but they
are keeping it in the background for fear
that it will not be so easy to get me back
to Australia."
Soon after Butler had reached this point
in his story the guards were chanted and
be relapsed into silence.
Those who heard the tale were not im
pressed with the Butler version of the
Preston killing, for it has long been a set
tled conviction in their minds that both
Preston and Weller were murdered by the
sailor, but it removed any lingering doubt
in their minds that he was the culprit.
His air while confessing was a mixture
of earne-tnesÃ that impressed the depu
ties, and fear tbat made them think that
he had an idea that they were incredu
lous.
Tired of the annoyances of prison life,
weary of the prospect of the gallows in
Australia, and fearful ; of the added cer
tainty of conviction in view of what
he had said, .Frank Butler, the accused

murderer of the Blue Mountains, at
tempted suicide at the County Jail at an
early hour yesterday morning.
In lieu of poison or weapons, the des
perate and despondent prisoner tried to
sever the right temporal artery with his
right thumb nail.
He was lying down at the time and
might have succeeded had he not flinched
and shuddered visibly several times in
such a way as to attract the attention of
the guards. He was lying on bis floor
cot wrapoed in blankets, and worked for
nearly half an hour before he was discov
ered. HBfr* I *^
When the guards found tbat something
was wrong they made him sit up. Though
he tried to conceal his face it was seen at
once that the prisoner was covered with
blood.
"What's the matter?" asked Guard
Kisling, in reply to which Butler said he
bad accidentally scratched himself with a
ragged thumbnail. -XSSS
â¢ The wound was at once cleaned by the
deputies, and Jailer Satler closely
trimmed tbe man's finger and the nails to
prevent a second attempt along the same
lines. ".
BVitler refused to show himself tore
porters ; yesterday, but he answered some
questions in a sullen way as be crouched
in the corner of his -cell, fearing, he said,
that artists might get his picture.* '
"How" about the report that you tried to
kill yourself?" he was asked.
"I don't want to talk about it."
"Shall we deny it?"
"I don't care a -^â what you do."
Finally the prisoner's manner became
slightly more courteous, though he would
not come forward and speak in his former
sociable way.
"You may deny the story," be finally
said, "For what occurred was only an
accident."
Butler denies that his true name has yet.
been published, and he pretends that he
is keeping it from the world because of a
sense of duty to his family.
Those who rave been with the prisoner
continuously and studied his manner
closely, say be is losing courage and be
coming nervous.
Owing to a delay in. the English mails
the Mariposa will not sail until 5 p. m. to
day. Butler's cell is near the cabin on the
second fleck, and not far from the dining
room. It is built , in such a way that it :
will be impossible for him to escape.

profits of the new combine will go into
hundreds of thousands, if not millions.
The lumbermen are satisfied the ciga r
shaped rafts will revolutionize the lumber
business of the Pacific Coast. It has
been proved that they are a succcjsâ
that is, that the big rafts can be safely
and successfully brought here from points
on the upper coast and from Puget Sound.
More than this, not alone are pile tim
bers brought as formerly, but logs for
making all kinds of lumber. Here, too,,
ere lone are to arise extensive lumber
mills, employing . probably . many thou
sands of men. â¢99SERP"*Â£lB0*-tSSB>
Nor dots this stop here. The refuse of
the mills is to be utilized in many differ
ent ways, as -the blood, hoofs and bones
are from the great bee! and pork packing
establish in Chicago, Omaha and
Kansas City. \
J. F. Kennedy, the extensive mill an
lumber man of this City, has been made
president of the new syndicate. At his
office yesterday he told of the organiza
tion of the big company and its object.
His story fully bore out all that rumor
had ascribe 1 to the enterprise.
He said that some years ago, when Man
ager Donohue was "yet alive, be bad con
tracted with H.R. Robertson, the proprie
tor of the Joggins raits on the Atlantic
coast, to come here and build and float
rafts to this City. Soon after Robertson's
arrival Mr. Donobue died, and as Mr. Rob
ertson was by contract tied up with the
estate be could not immediately, carry out
his purposes.
' "He and. his associates, however,", said
Mr. Kennedy, "finally launched a raft in
October, at a time of the year when the
most experienced lumberman thought he
could not possibly reach this 'City with it.
He was unfortunate in striking bad
weather, but besides this the towage was
inÃufficient.'sS"ffiPÃgt**MÃi*'B*~M
"When the next . raft was launched,
however, the Mineola, loaded with 4000
tons of coal, was used as a tug, and the
raft came through , safely. Every other
effort was also attended with success.
"We. the 'lumbermen of this* City, at
once saw that it was hopeless for us to at
tempt to compete with the new method
by bringing logs s here: in vessels, as for-"
merly. They could so undersell us that
we couldn't sdo business at all. The old
method was a thing of the past.
"As a result there has been a very strong
company formed : here, composed of all
the leading lumbermen, ami we will go
into a general rafting * business. I was on
the Columbia two weeks ago. and arranged
for 1,000.000 : feet of 10g5., -Mr. Eobertson
is there, now; and we will at once proceed
to build a great raft, and will bring two at
least this ; yearâ one ; in v June and â¢ one ; in
August. ; . Our . cradle ; tbere is capable of
holding 10,000 sticks, averaging titty feet
in length, or 500.000 linear lee L ;' 1 believe
there are about . 7,000,000 feet, lumber
measurement. .^Â£Plfo(MyflÃlÃÃtt&HH&VÃ
'"All the principal importing lumber
men are in the company. I would, not
like to mention their names, for 'some of
them might not like it, but these details
it is just us well perhaps that the public
should know.
"We apprehend that the business will
increase and grow into great importance.
It may be that we will put up miils here.
They will probably be on the peninsula,
but it may be that we can get more here.
The peninsula would be better for han
dling the refuse. , This refuse, by the way,
is very important On Pupet Sound at
the mills proDably a third of the lumber
is wasted. ' They make huge fires and
burn enormous quantities of slabs.
"We will save everything and utilize it
in some shape. The "slabs, bark, sawdust
ana every; hing else will have a use. We
may erect creosoting works.
â¢"By having the logs here we can furnish
mixed cargoes. We expect to bring down
redwoods in raits. We will need several
very large plants. The chances are we
will build another cradle on the sound
also and bring down lumber from there
soon." . ...
The combination of all the leading im
porting lumbermen to erect mills here and
furnish lumber to foreign ships will mean
a good deal for San Francisco. The sav
ing of the refuse as indicated by Mr. Ken
nedy will also mean a great deal.
WATER FOR THE HEIGHTS
A Suitable Site Has Been
Bonded, With a Pro
. vision.
The Real Estate and Development
Company Favors the Residents
in Their Wants-
At last the residents of Southern
Heights are in a fair way to be provided
with an adequate water supply. For
years this section of the City has been
without a proper supply of water, the
pressure being so light that in the day
time no water could be obtained, and the
residents were foiced to draw water at
nigbt time and store it in buckets, tubs or
improvised tanks in order to bave a sup
ply for the following day.
Within the past week the Spring Valley
Water Works lias bonded a site for a
reservoir, being the' northerly 200 feet of
New Potrero block 194. This site is the
lop of the highest bill in the Potrero, and
is at an elevation of more than 300 feet
above the City base, and fronts on Twen
ty-second (formerly Sierra) street, between
Wisconsin and Carolina.
The Real Estate and Development Com
pany, who are the owners of this block of
land, have, together witb the residents in
this section of the City, been endeavoring
for a number of years to get the Spring
Valley Water Works to locate a reservoir
or tank on this location, and for the past
two years there has been a greater effort
than formerly to have this water supply,
as about that time Sixteenth street, from
Harrison, was regraded to a lower grade,
and the water mains leading to tbe
Potrero were taken out, leaving only
about half the former supply of water.
Mr. SchuÃsler at the meeting of the
Board of Supervisors on Thursday night
stated that I his company had bonded the
reservoir site and would complete a reser
voir or tank during the present year. They
have already begun to secure data as to
the construction of a tank or reservoir and
the laying of pipes. On Tuesday last a
party of their surveyors made. a survey of
the site, and immediately a force of labor
ers were set at work in different portions
of the block,. making slight excavations in
order to test the character of the founda
tion so that plans can be prepared for a
reservoir or tanfc*l"Â«gs^^s*3t*fersjÃ*^*jÃ**BM*M|
The Real Estate and Development Com
pany has owned this and' the adjoining
blocks for a number of years, and while
the price is not definitely given, it is un
derstood that they have sold tbe site to
the Spring Valley Company at about 30
per cent less than they originally paid for
it, in order to have a reservoir located
thereon.
The deed to the Spring Valley Water
Company has been bunded with the im
plied understanding that the location is
to bo used for a reservoir, and that it must
be completed during the present year.
This news was the theme of general re
joicing at the meeting of the Southern
Improvement Club last night, when Pres
ident Pengclly stated the above condi
tions.
Secretary James Gluskin annouced that
since the last meeting of thÂ» club over
fifty more names had been added, to the
roll.
The question of additional lights and
tbe laying down of a sidewalk on Nine
teenth street, from Tennessee to Minne
sota, was recommended by the street
committee of the club. y/y
LOOKING FOR THEIR FEES
Justices of the Peace Want Pay
for Sitting in Con
tests.
A Protest Against the Payment of
the Allowance in the Code**
MahonÂ°y Case.
Justices of the Peace Barry and Groe
zinger have grown impatient at the non
payment of their fees for sitting in the
election contest case of Code â against Ha
honey and have filed a protest with Wells,
Fargo & Co., who hold a power of attor
ney â  for the collection of the amount
allowed by the Legislature, , against i the
payment until the claims are satisfied.
P. D. Code, the Republican candidate
or the Assembly from ihe Thirty-fourth
District, contested the right of Frank E.
Mafioney, who was declared elected, to
the seat and County Clerk Curry appoint
ed Justices Barry and 'Groezinger to bear
the testimony. The Legislature allowed
Mahbnev, who successfully' defended' his
seat, $607 38. and .*. bis * opponent ' $384 92.
The amount allowed for the Justice fees
was $114 from each side. .
.Two years ago, in the contests in which
they sat, the Justices did not receive a
dollar of their fees, and the troubles that
ensued caused scandals in which a number
of prominent attorneys and politicians
were implicated. This year the Justices
do not intend to lose tneir money and
have prepared for any kind of a fight to
obtain it. i-'* : Sjtfflgg%i|i J^JBSjjffi y ffJS aaai y i qÃJ!SSi
The jurists were informed that Mahoney
had hud the warrant for his allowance
drawn in his own name, an . that if tbey
did not get in when the money was col
lected it might all be paid out before their
share : was â¢ apportioned. . Then Justice
Barry filed the protest mentioned, and the
two; Justices will be present to protect
their rights when the money arrives.
A like state of affairs exists in the case
of \ the ; Hooy - contest, in which? Justices
Kerrigan : and ', Groezinger sat, â¢ and ; pro- .
ceedings will be taken to see that tbev are
protected in this manner. Justice Kerri
gan says that the money will be paid or
some one will bave to stand a criminal
prosecution. .'.'.- - : .- â :'â  .-. . ?

TRADE IS A
GREAT SCIENCE
Hence It Should Be Taught
in the Univer
sity.
Arthur Rodgers Advocates the
Establishing of. a College
of Commerce.
His Reasons Why the Project Should
Be Considered as One of the
Greatest Importance.
At their next meeting the Board of Re
gents of the State University will discuss
the subject of the establishment in con
nection with the university at Berkeley of
a College of Commerce.
The project was evolved from the fertile
brain of Arthur Rodgers, a member of the
board. While traveling in Europe some
years ago' Mr. Rodgers became convinced
of the necessity for such an institution.
At the' last meeting of the board * Mr.
Rodgers introduced a * resolution calling
for action toward that end, and the matter
was laid over until the next monthly
meeting.;
There never has been and is not now a
college of commerce in the world, and it
remains for California to pluck the honors
for being the pioneer in the movement.
A college â . of commerce is practically a
college for tbe graduation of merchantsâ
not the ordinary merchant of to-day, but
the merchant who knows everything con
nected with the laws and operations of
manufacture and trade all over the worldâ
in short, the merchant who is now only
one in ten thousand. > - ..;
"We are ; entering apparently upon a
new . province in education," - said Mr.
Rodgers to ; a Call, reporter yesterday.
"There has been instruction given -in
many branches of business, but there has
been no co-ordination ot subject- so as to
constitute a. college of commerce. <. The
collation of materials and the classifica
tion of principles* applicable to commerce
have not been "formulated. There has
been no satisfactory statement of the prin
ciples of transportation ; there has been
no analysis cf r the. different elements of
even simple exchange; the 'racing of the
product from the soil throuph all its modi
fications of form and cost, including its
transportation, the persons handling it,
the manner of its distribution to other
countries and its adoption to the demand
in those countries.', XX'': y
â  : .l "There is not even any satisfactory his
tory of commerce in general, the commer
cial treaties, systems and policies of differ-
I ent nations. It is true that we. have his-
I tories of Â» wars and* political changes, but
I we \ have ;â¢ no ' : histories 'â  of ; ! the conquests
j .which 7 have made civilization â con
j quests sof ; commerce, -which ; have made
civilization possible. We have no collec
' , tion of statistics and materials which'
may be said to indicate the ceneral prin
ciples of ) commerce. All these will have
to bo created, and they will follow the es
tablishment of such a college.* :"^ ';*'...-'

only'teacbing, but original investigation. i
In the college of chemistry this is done
in the laboratories; in. the college of min
ing in laboratories and actual work. The
original investigation in the college of
commerce will include the collection and
classification of general facts relating to
commerce, which will gradually result in
establishing the laws of trade. |-~
"That department of original investiga
tion would imply many other things, such [
as a bureau of statistics. Such ; a bureau
would be valuaole, not only as a matter of
theory leading up to tbe establishment of
the -laws of commerce, but would be of
great practical value to all - persons en
gaged in trades or vocations concerning
which the statistics themselves would be
gathered for the purpose of deducing gen
eral principles from them.
"Such a bureau would : be practicable
and useful, not only for.the trade, but for
every one else who has to do with those
departments of trade from.which the sta- 'â '
tistics were collated. They deal with
matters in which the world is chiefly in
terestedâ finance, etc.
"If a young man gets into the mental
habit "of considering principles with a
view to their application he acquires the
same habit which the successful merchant
or manager .of business acquires after
years of training in his vocation. Not so
much to consider the details of .the facts
separately as to consider them compre
hensively.
"There is another advantage in such a
school. "'. It will attract men who will be
come leaders of business in the country.
It will educate leaders as distinguished
from mere bookkeepers, clerks, etc., and
it will brine to the university a class of
men who now refrain ; from going to col
lege. As an evidence of the Importance
of such an institution as the one proposed,
it should be remembered that business in
some department or other occupies at
least one-half of our population. But
there is no general collegiate course pro
vided now to educate that class. If such
provision couid be made we will develop
such a grade of business men as have not
yet been known in this country â broad
minded, fair-minded men and managers
of commercial affairs. " . iy.-..yy
. "How many business men can be named
who look upon their respective vocations
in the broad comprehensive way of, inter
national trade? .'â  How many can give you
the elements or the general principles of
any * business transaction extending - be
yona.their own affairs? \ .'.-..:.-
"I have not spoken of the practical ad
vantages of such :â¢ college. They should
be apparent to every one. but when we
cons. that we are many days from the
leading markets of the United States and
from the markets "of Europe on the verge
of the Pacific we appreciate- the necessiiv
of a scientific system of exchange.or of
"commerce in order that we may be repaid
for our efforts; in producing products so
various ; and to such a great extent all in
our own State. We can truly say that the
commercial problems, are the . leading
problems to Californians.*-.
: . "We have al ready â  proved some of , the
. capacities of our soil .a nd" our ability to
produce. unlimited products in quantities
and in values, and we must now rind mar
kets. .Commerce, therefore. . becomes â¢ the
(leading study for our people." â - " x
