Crete Proceeds, R gardless of
European Powers.
ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 16.â The first
definite news of a Greek victory in Crete
was received this evening and the wildest
enthusiasm followed the intelligence.
The Greeks, it is said, attacked and
captured Fort Aghai, taking 400 Mussul
mans prisoners. Among the number are
100 Turkish troops, the remainder of the
prisoners being Moslems who took refuge
in the fort. '
â¢ Details of the engagement are Jacking.
One report states that no fighting oc
curred, the garrison surrendering upon
the demand of tne Greek commander. As
no mention of any losses is made in any
of '.he dispatches it is surmised that this
â report is true.
Notwithstanding the reports that the
powers would take concerted action to !
prevent Greece from taking farther hostile !
action in Crete, warlike preparations are j
being made with ail possible dispatch. In i
addition to the "corps of occupation"
already in the island, which corps num
bers 1500 men of all arms, one other regi
ment embarked upon a transport and I
sailed for Crete to-night. Another regi
ment will sail thither to-morrow.
The Government is preparing for every
po-Sible contingency and has summoned i
two classes of the naval reserve for active
srritee. *~ "T.'X. .',''.' â¢ -Â_â¢.-^-^^..rm^'v^.,^;
'â  The people are in a frenzy of excitement
nnd demand that the. Cretan question be
settled now for all time. It is popularly
thought that when the powers find the
annexation of the island, which Greece
.has in view, an accomplished fact, they
will readily acquiesce in this spoliation of
the Turk.
Advices received here from Crete say |
that none of the foreign warships in
Cretan waters have landed any men, ex
cept at Canea. As the Greek troops that
landed at Akrotiri were not hindered by j
the powers in disembarking, it is con- |
sidered that the powers recognize the right j
of Greece to intervene in Crete.

this notification the Greek colonel re- '

ROME, Italy, Feb. 16.â The bold action
I of Greece in attempting to solve the Cre

} popular admiration everywhere in Italy
1 and a great Italo-Crete agitation is being

CANTON, Ohio. Feb. 16â fix-Senator
Warner Miiler of New York, after await
ing the physician's verdict, was compelled ]
to forego the pleasure of seeing the Presi
dent-elect. There are various reasons as
signed for Mr. Miller's visit to Canton.
That most p enerally accepted is thai he
proposed to make some statement regard
ing the chances of a New York man being
proffered a Cabinet portfolio. In convei
sation with friend*, it is said, he stated
that the Empire State would orobabiy be
without a representative in the Presi
dent's official family. To the press reDre
sentatives he declined to discuss the Cab
inet situation.
Another view, and it appears a very
sensible one, is that Mr. Miller intended
to urge Major McKinley to recommend
the oassage of the Nicaragua canal bill in
his message to Congress at the special ses
sion. Whatever his intention was, he
was unsuccessful in his mis ion.
The Presidentelect remained in his
room all day, and was seen by no one ex- |
cept mother McKinley and the members
of his own household. He will not go to
Cleveland Wednesday, and his visit may I
be postponed until the last of the week. |

NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 16.â A World

of has been doing remarkable work again.
Letters from Candelaria, Pinar del Rio,
report it could not be used lately, as the
ammunition was out, but an expedition
just came with a new supply.
Adetac racnt of 700 Spaniards under
Colonel Sanchez attacked one of General
Goriano's camps last week, hoping to cap
ture the gun. It was known to be stowed
there, and me Spaniards had beard there
was noammuniiion for it. The insurgents
were well protected by intrenchments,
and knew the enemy's plans. As the
Spanish troops advanced the insurgents
met them with a rapid fire of musketry
and then retreated, as if in disorder, up a
narrow gorge to a second net of works.
The Spaniards, thinking victory was
within their grasp, rushed forward, de
spite the orders of their officers, who sus
pected a trap. No sooner had they fairly
entered the cul de sac than the dynamite
gun opened on them.
â  The first shell killed dozens in the front
rank. A second shot did still more dam-
I age, and then a third and fourth. By
[ this time the troops had managed to get
out and an insurgent charge completed
the rout.
More than 300 Spaniards are said to
have been killed, wounded or captured,
five officers being killed. The Cubans lost
seveniy-five men. The Spanish prisoners
were sent to the Spanish camp at Can
delaria, with a note from the insurgent
commander asking the Spanish officer to
deal as humanely with insurgents who
fell into his bands.

Sensatlonal Editorial That the Spaniards

NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 16.â A dis
patch to the Sun from Havana says: In
tense excitement has been produced in
Havana over an editorial published in El
Pais, in Madrid, on January 22, and which
which has circulated widely in spite of trie
efforts of the police, who, by orders of the
Governor of the province, are seizing all
the copies they can rind of this issue of
the Spanish newspaper. Photographic
copies of the page containing the article
and even manuscript copies pass from
hand to hand.
The article, after saying that the nation
has failed in Cuba, notwithstanding the
fact that Spain has sent 200,000 men
to the island and has spent one billion
pesetas, concludes that in the present crit
ical situation Spain must confess her de
feat, and the Spaniards must punish their
own Government.upon which rests the re
sponsibility.
"Our only hope," says â¢ the article,
"rests upon our diplomacy in the United
States, but if we also fail in that field, as
the indications are that we will, we have
but one way of salvation, and that is to
establish the republic in Spain through a
national revolution." v
No newspapers in Havana. dares to re

in fact, an appeal to the -Republicans to

CECIL RHODES AS A WITNESS.
The South Afnccn Magnate Tells of the
Circumstances Leading Up to the
Transvaal Raid.
LONDON, Exg., Feb. 16.â The Parlia- j
rnentary Committee recently appointed
by the House of Commons to inquire into
the causes and circumstances of the
troubles in the Transvaal began its sit
tings to-day.
Cecil Rhodes was the first witness ex
amined. He was in sympathy w.tb the
Uitlauders in their grievances, and to as
sist a movement designed to obtain for ;
them their constitutional rights he had J
placed on the Transvaal, under orders of
Dr. Jameson, a force of troops, with in- I
structions to act should certain events
arise.
At this point Sir William Harcourt in
terrupted Rhodes and asked: "Was your
object to overthrow the Transvaal Gov
ernment?"
Mr. Rhodes replied that the overthrow
of the Government was not bis obiect, but
merely to bring about a change. He ad
mitted the probability of his having done
wrong in placing Dr. Jameson, with his
men, on the frontier, but Jameson's in
vasion of the Transvaal he was not re
sponsible for, as Jameson had gone into
the Boer territory without his (Rhodes')
authority.

his designs and replied that he had not.
Sir William Harccurt asked why he had
not informed the Briiisn High Commis

had better set an answer to that question
from Lord Rosemead."
It was impossible, he said, that the
present state of things in Johannesburg
and other parts of the Transvaal should
continue. The people would not cease
their agitation until they obtained their
civil rights.

UNION, Mo., Feb. 16.â Arthur Duestrow
was hanged in the Franklin County Jail
at 1 o'clock to-day. The condemned man,
who has simulated insanity since the day
of the crime, kept up his role until late
la<-t eveniiii:.
He arose shortly after 7 o'clock this
morning, and for the first time in three
years he broke down and his usual air of
haughty indifference gave way to one of
despair. He begged the guards to save
nim from his fate, and requested that
messages be sent to Governor Stephens in
terceding in his behalf. To nearly every
visitor and attendant Duesirow appealed
for assistance, and asked that the follow
ing telegram be sent to ex-Governor John
son, his counrel, in St. Louis:
"I am in a predicament ; intercede with
Governor Stephens lor me immediately.
I need your advice. I was insane, bui it
did me no good. I have nothing left, but
hope for forgiveness."
This was signed "General Branden
burg," a name and character assumed by
Duestrow during the past few months.
The murderer partook of a scanty break
fast, and when it was finished he lay down
on his cot and gave way to a burst of
tears. He sobbed convulsively and cried
out frequently, "0, God! This is terri
ble."
Shortly before 1 o'clock the Sheriff noti
fied Duestrow that his last hour had ar
rived and in a few moments the guards
announced that all was in readiness for
the execution.
The Sheriff gave the order to proceed
and ihe march to the scaffold began, the
Sheriff leading the way, followed by Dues-
trow with a Deputy Sheriff on either side,
and a large crowd of newspaper men and
doctors. Duestrow was apparently un
concerned and when he mounted the scaf
fold he showed no nervousness. After
the rope had beon placed about his legs
the Sheriff asked him if he had anything
to sny.
"Nothing but that a big mistake is
being made," he said. Then as the rope
was beintT adjusted about 'his neck ne
a-^ked, -l May 1 say a few words?' 1 The
Sheriff gave assent and Duestrow SDoke in,
almost a whisper as follows:
"I wish to say that a big mistake is

The condemned man hesitated as if
about to talk more, but Sheriff Pnchta
raised bis hand; the black cap was placed
over Duestrow's head and the cord drawn
tightly.
Duestrow shouted to one of tbe depu
ties, "Good-by, Simon," and the trap was
sprung. Duestrow's neck was not broken
by the fall. In eight minutes after he was
pionounced dead.
The body was turned over to an under
taker representing Miss Huldah Duestrow
of St. Louis, a sister of the dead man, and
will be taken to that city this evening,
where the remains will be interred along
side tbe murderer's father in Bellefontaine
Cemetery.
â  Tbe undertaker stated that he had posi
tive instructions not to embalm the body,
and this is taken as evidence that a post
mortem examination will be made to de
termine the condition of Duestrow's brain.
JTRVJU i: I fill:* TO THE GALLOWS.
JXtsipalion Ihat Ltd to the Killing of
Ui/e antt < hllri.
Arthur Duestrow was about thirty years
old and belonged to one of t:ie oldest and
best-known families in Missouri. His
father made his money in mining stocks
and when he died left a fortune of more
than two million dollars to his widow and
two child/en. The widow did not long
survive her husband, and then Arthur
Duestrow became a millionaire in his own
right. His sister, Miss Huldah Duestrow,
inherited the other half of the estate.
Few young men began life under such
brilliant prospects as did Arthur Dues
trow. He had passed through college
before attaining his majority and coming
into his fortune. Soon after his father's
death he married Miss Albertina Leisse,
and about that time entered tbe St, Louis
Medical College, from which he was
graduated with honors.
For a short time Duestrow abandoned
the bibulous habits he had formed and
bis friends believed that be bad sowed
his wild oats and bad settled down to a
respectable life. A baby boy came to the
Duestrow home and the young husband
and wife were proad and happy. But
when the baby was about a year oid Due-
Btrow lell from grace. He became infatu
ated with the keeper of an improper house
in St. Louis. So public was his intimacy J
â with tn is woman that friends of his wile
wondered at her continued life with her
husband. Perhaps the baby boy induced
her to condone ncr husband's faults, or
perhaps her loving eyes saw nothing j
wrong. At any rate the Duestrow family â¢
continued to reside in the handsome house {
at 1724 South Compton avenue.
On the evening of February 13, 1894, he j
shot and instantly killed i.is son and
fataliy wounded his wife at their home. [
Mr?. Duestrow died three days later, on j
February 18, having been unconscious ;
during the whole time after she received j
the fatal bullets in her head. Duestrow j
was crazy drunk when be commuted the
murder.
For some time he had lapsed from his
duty to his young wife and was spending j
much time and moaev upon an inmate of j
a bawdy-house. On the day of the tragedy |
he spent several hours at the House of his |
mistress in drinking, and from there went '
direct to his home, 1724 South Compton
avenue. He intended taking his wife and
child out sleigh-riding in tbe evening.
Arriving at tbe house Deustrow got out of j
the sleigh, leaving it in charge of tbe
driver, and entered the house. Mrs.
Dcnstrow was sitting upstairs in her room I
sewing, and the little boy Louis was play- i
me on the floor beside her. Katie Hahn,
a domestic, was also in the room. Tbe
girl met him on the stairway, and in
reply to a simple question he began curs- j
ing and abusing her, driving her back up
stairs into his wife's room. Arriving |
there he turned upon his wife, cursing j
her. He then slapped her and attempted
to strike Miss H;.hn. Mrs. Duestrow in
terfered, saying, "If you want to strike
some one. Arthur, don't strike a stranger; |
strike me."
"Ail richt, I will," he said, and struck
her a blow that felled her. He then took
his boy, aged 18 months, and went down- I
stairs and returned very soon with a pistol
in his hand.
'â¢Don't shoot, Arthur, you're drunk,"
said bis wife.
'I'll show you who is drunk," he said,
and he fired two shots into her body. For
a moment he seemed to realize tbe enor
mity of hi* crime. He knelt beside tbe i
dying woman, and in maudlin tones said,
"Tina, Tina; are you dead?"
Receiving no reply, his drunken frenzy
returned. He grasped his child, who had I
been f> spectator to ihe murder. He first |
started to go downstairs with the boy, j
but returned to tbe ball, held the shriek- I
ing babe by one arm to the wall and fired j
a shot into his brain.
Deustrow rushed through the falling
snow to the police station and told his.
ytory, claiming at the Bame lime that be
hail attempted to shoot himself. All the
influences that his wealth could buy were
brought into play to save the murderer.
Soon after incarceration he began the in
sanity dodge and has kept it up steadily
ever since. The records of the trials show
how a rich man's trial can be delayed
compared with the rapidity with which a
poor man is "railroaded" to the gallows.
On January 19, 1890, two years after the
crime was committed, tbe Supreme Court
of Missouri decided that be should be
haneed February 16.
Tbe servant girl, who bad fled to the top
of the house, was a witness to the scene,
and it was her testimony that convicted
Deus.row.
Duestrow's case bas become historical.
His great wealth, inherited from his
father, bas enabled him to emt-loy able
counsel who have made a legal fight that
will go down in tbe annals of jurispru
dence. Learned medical experts were
pnid enormou â¢ fees to ascribe to the mur
derer a new mental disease. They were
opposed, on the other band, by medical
experts of equal eminence hired by the
State. Tbe medical world became inter
ested in tbe case, and the various trials
threatened to become little else than a
neurological debate. Beginning at a time
shortly subsequent to his crime, Dues
trow's manner was adapted to support the
insanity theory. Agents were sent to
Europe to collect evidence of hereditary
mental weakness. Nothing that could be
done was left undone.
Four trials, not counting numerous bear-
Ings, lasting in the aggregate for months
and costing the State an enormous sum,
have been bad. Two were inquiries into
the mental condition of tbe defendant,
and two were for tbe crime. There was
a mistrial in each instance, which necessi
tated the recovering of the whole ground.
First a jury decided that Duestrow was
responsible for his actions, and then an
other jury found him guilty of murder in
tbe first degree.
Tom this verdict an appeal waÂ» taken
to the Supreme Court. Although very
wealthy Duestrow's inheritance was in
such a shape that only the income conld
be touched. Tbe expenses of bis defense
have been very large and the income bas
long since been exhausted. At present he
owes bis attorneys and experts large
amounts and judgments against his cura
tor are numerous on the records of the
Circuit Court Endless litisution may
grow out of these judgments, as his Bhare
purses to his sister on his death nnd she
will not pay them. His sole surviving
relative is his sister and she ha 3 persist
ently refused to visit him or assist him in
any way.

NICARAGUA CANAL PROJECT.
Hon. Warner Miller Says It Will Ultimately
Be Built and .Controlled by This
Government.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 16.â Hon.
Warner Miller is at the Arlington. He
will remain in the city for several days
looking after the welfare of the Nicaragua
canal project. He said to a representative
of The Call to-nipht that he bad little
doubt but that the canal would ultimately
be built and controlled by the American
Government. *
"The people want the canal," said the
ex-Senator, "and the demand for it is con
stantly increasing all over the country.
They not only want the canal, but they
want the control of it placed in the hands
of the Government, which would be the
case should the bill introduced by Senator
Morgan become a law. It is not, of course,
expected that the present Congress will
do anything for the bill, but if an extra
session is called Morgan will reintroduce
the bill and I believe it will be passed. It
provides that the Government shall have
ten of the thirteen members of the board
of directors, which would practically make
the canal a Government institution. As
to the question of subsidy the canal and
Pacific railroads arc not parallel cases, for
in the latter the Government has practi
cally no voice in the finances and it would
nave all to say concerning the canal.
"You may depend on it that when the
bill comes before the next Congress it will
be there for final disposition, and if the
Government does not see fit to accept the
opportunity for controlling the canal,
European Governments will gladly avail
themselves of the chance. The Nioaraguan ,
canal should belong to this country, and
the people will be more than displeased if j
at any time a foreign power should build
aud control it."
It is not improbable that Senator Sher
man will signalize bis term of office as
Secretary of State with the inauguration
of the real work of building the canal. It
is known that he has no faitn in the abil
ity of any corporation to build that water
way. Senator Sherman said in a recent
speech: -, H?B
"I should be very glad to see another
treaty made between Nicaragua and the
United States which would provide for the
completion of the canal â something that
would be acceptable to the United States
Governmentâ and then we should proceed
to deal with the canal precisely as we have
dealt with the"great canal upon Lake
Superior and the other public works of our
country."
The speech is taken ex-cathedra. It is
believed to be the first outline of what the
next administration's policy will be with
respect to an interoceanlc canal on the
isthmus.
"QUID A" ON IMMIGRATION.
Pleads for //literate Italians as Against
"You'h Corrupted and Diseased by
Cheap Journalism."
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 16. -Under
date of January 80, Louise de la Ramee,
the novelist, better known under her norn
de-plume of "Ouida," addressed the fol
lowing letier to Secretary Olney relative
to the immigration bill, the conference re
port on which will come before the Senate
to-morrow:
Sir: Will you pardon my addressing you
concerning the bill which I see Is before Con
gress in intent to bar immigrants who cannot
read? It you exclude Italians who cannot
read you will lose the best and most laborious
part of tbe population and you will admit the
trash of cities. It is not a question which
cannot properly be applied to Italians, or, in
deed, to any foreign people. Why should you
â¢uppose the power to spell out tbe crimes re
corded in corruDt newspapers Is any guarantee
for either virtue or Intelligence?
In Italy tho peasantry are almost entirely
illiterate; yet ibey are tbe only class which
can give immigrants ol any value. I have
bad many men in my employ, aud I have in
variably found those who could not read tea
times more industrious, temperate, intelligent
and honest than those corrupted by the
trumpery "education" of schools. I have had
for twenty year* an old man (who has been
what is called me odd man In England), and
he can be sent with fifty commissions to pur-
Chase objects detailed him only orally, and ho
will execute these commissions with no single
error, either of oblivion or of payment. Such
a man you would turn from your shores, whi c
you would receive the youth corrupted, emns
culated, diseased tnromgh cheap journalism,
bad tobacco and the e.iforced physical idle
nets of the schools. 1 beg you to allow me to
remain, obediently yours, "Ouida."

STILL LEXOWING
THE SUGAR TRUST
Secretary Searles Proves a
Cool and Cautious
Witness.
Once, However, He Grows Angry
and Snaps Back at His
Tormentors.
Hakes Sms Admissions, bat Fails to
v Produce the Bocks and Leaves
the Stand Smi ing.
NEW YORK, K. V., Feb. 16.-The
legislative cummi'.tee investieating the
trusts and monopolies in this Stale re
sumed its inquiry this morning. Mr. j
Searles wa3 on hand early and nis ex- j
animation was continued, iir. Searles >
said there was very litile profit in the
business for five years before the trust â 
was formed and :ienied tliat there was a '
sevenfold capital izaiion of the Mock after
the consolidation of the refineries.
Senator Lexow then put a number of
long questions as to whether the consumer
can get the benefit of the reduction in the
price of .the raw material so long as ap
gregations of capital designed to control
prices are permitted to exist.
"I can't imagine such a thing existing.
I aon't believe the Legislature can remedy j
such a state of affairs if it existed. As I j
said before, the Jaw of supply and demand
will regulate ail these thin&s in time."
In renly to another question the witness
acknowledged that the consumer had not
received the full benefit of the decrease in
the price of raw material
Mr. Searles cot hot at one of Senator
Lexow's questions and snapped bacK:
"The American Sugar Refining Company !
is not a monopoly or a quasi-nionopoly
in any sense of the word. The American
Sugar Refining Company is in the interest
of the ronsnmer, end there is no reason
why the State should interfere with its ;
business in any particular.''
Senator Lexow then went off on another
tack. "Mr. Searles, '' he said, ''have you
since yesterday given the production of
books any consideration ?''
"I have not," said Mr. Searles, with a
smite.
Lawyer Parsons of counsel for the sugar i
company said tbe directors would meet !
to-morrow and he would lay the matter !
before tiiem. Mr. Parsons said mat H. 0. ;
Havemeyer would be pre.-enton Thursday
morning and i.c would carry tne answer
of the directors in regard to ihe produc
tion of the books. Tuis was satisiactory J
to tbe committee.
In reply 10 another question Mr. Searles
said ihat be believed there was at. much
labor if not more employed now than be- ,
fore the consolidation.
Senator Lexow wanted the figures in i
that respect, ana Mr. Parsons, speaking !
for Mr. Searles, said he would request Mr.
Havemeyer to produce the desired data.
"Perhaps these figures are also de- j
stroyed," remarked Chairman Lexow, and i
Mr. Searies smiled.
Witness said there was an increase of
fu.iy 10 per cent in wages after the forma
tion of the trust.
"Did you say tliat the trust was formed
because of illegal combinations of labor?"
"I said that there were combinations of
labor which incited strikes and these
strikes were for increased wages.'"
This closed the examination of Mr. i
Searles, who left tlie stand smiling.
Lawyer Fuller was tuen recalled as an
â¢Xpert and said that the sugar trust was '
formed to reduce expenses, and there was j
more machinery In u?e now ti.an when it I
was formed, consequently le-s men. Mr. i
Fuller, alter answering some further ques- i
tio:is, said :
"Now, I want to say that if you give us .
honest Senators we will h*ve ciieaper su- :
gar. I am in favor of < lectmg men to [
Congress who will legislate la favor of the
public."
Tnere was applruise from the spectators
at this nmark, which Chairman Lexow
suppressed.
"We will now take up tbe United States
Rubber Company," said Senator Lexow.
The first witness was Charles li. Flint.
Mr. Flint described the compaiiv, of which
he was trea urer and a member of the
board of directors, by wring it was organ
ized in New Jersey in 1892. He stid there
had been an understand. iig in the rubber
business in regard to prices for the past
twenty years, and that the object of the
consolidation w;Â»s to secure economy, by
centralization. He explained thatthecon
solidated companies controlled about 50
per cent of tbe rubber business and com
petition was continued with the companies
doing the rest of the business.
The witness was examined at great
len.'tn concerning the stock issues, the
purchases of competing properties and
other detaiis of the business np to tbe hour i
of adjournment.

BRiAA'B POSITIOS SUSTAINED.
Xcbraaka'i . Smpr-tne Court nrcidea a
Crltbratetl Injunction' Cat c.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Feb. 16.â The .some
what celebrated gold bond injunction suit
in which W. J. Bryan, as the plaintiff,
sought to restrain ttie Mayor and City
Council from delivering $534, 600 refunding
bonds with a gold clause attached to City
Treasurer Stepbenson, was to- -lay decided
by the Supreme Court and Mr. Bryan's
position was sustained.
Nearly two years ago a proposition to
vote bonds was submitted and carried by
a bare majority. The City Council con
tracted for their purchase with Stephen
son, who insisted on a gold clause, which
was allowed. Mr.' Bryan enjoined the
sale on the ground that the bonds were
illegally carried, and further that the city
charter prohibited discrimination between
gold and currency bonds. District Judge
Holmes decided in his favor and the City
Council appealed. The Supreme Court
affirms the decision of tbe lower court,
laying strew on the fact that the -bonds
were illegally declared carried, but re
maining silent on the gold clause feature.
A RAISIN TRUST ORGAN /ZED.
To Establish Headquarters and Build a
Large Factory at Fresno, Which Will
Absorb Ail 0 hers.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 17.â The
World says: Another trust was born yes
terday â not a very big or vigorous one as
yet, for it is only an infant, but it prom
ises to grow. This new combine is the
rai-in trust. The capital stock was sub
scribed yesterday in Wall street; only
$500,000 as a starter, and the name has
not even been selected, but the object is in
plain sight
It is simply to control the entire raisin
industry of tbe country. Practically all
the native raisins come from the. grane
region of California, and the town o*
Fresno is the center of the business. The
new trust will make its headquarters
there and build a large factory, which is
expected to absoro all others.
The process of cleansing and preparing
raisins for the market is an old one, but
tbe new company has control of a novel
device for tujcing the seeds out of grapes,
and this is designed to give great ad
vantage over other concerns. Fred Nich
ols is to be president of tho new trust.
While declining to give any details of the
organization he said yesterday:
"We think this is a most opportune
time to embark in the enterprise. The
demand for raisins has grown to such pro
portions that it is impossible to respond to
the requirements of the trade except by
an investment of a large sum of money at
a point where the fruit can be bad at the
least expense. The men forming the com
pany are principally New Yorkers."

says: Rio de Janeiro advices state that
Colonel Moreiria Caesar, who was ordered
to Bahia to suppress the rebellion of the
fanatical bands under Consel Heiro, has
M-nt word that be must have more troops.
He declares that the strength of the fanat

Recruits in alarming numbers, Colonel
Caesar says, are daily joining the fanatics.
The headquarters of the rebels have been
removed from Canadaos to a more advan

It is feared that there will be a severe
struggle before the revolt is overcome.
The most serious allegations continue to
be made as to the cause ot the revolt and

certain Brazilian papers it is charged that
President Monies is himself responsible
for the disorder in the dominant parties
in the republic, this state of affairs being,

CHANDLER AS A
SILVER APOSTLE
Sees National Calamity in
the Single Gold
Standard.
Warns the Republican Party
That It Must Move for
Bimetallism.
Otherwise It Will Soon Change Places
With Its "Sore, Bleeding and
Prostrate Foes."
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 16â The
opening prayer in the Senate to-day was
offered by Rev. W. J. &. Brown of Lon
don. It embraced t:ie President-elect as
well as the President, and it asked that
tho^e who desired permanent peace be
iween the two great Englis -speaking na
tions may nave their desire accomplished.
Tiie House bill dividing the State of
Arkansas into two judicial districts â
eastern and western â was passed; also
the bill for the loan of tents for the use of
the G. A. R. encampment at Buffalo this
year.
Sherman (R.) of Ohio gave notice that
he would move to go into executive ses
sion tomorrow on the arbitration treaty,
and that he hoped then to get final action
on it.
The Judiciary Committee was discharged
from the further consideration of the Sen
ate bill to amend the act repealing the
timber-culture laws, and the bill was laid
before the Senate. This is the bill re
cently recalled from the President for the
purpose of baring it changed in a sub
stantial point. The House amendments
to the bill, which covered the points in
issue, were disagreed to and a conference
ordered.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire ad
dressed the Senate in support of i is reso
lution, offered February 2, declaring it to
be the sense of the Senate that the United
States should not permanently acquiesce
in the single cold standard. He said that
he lavored the resolution because he was
an advocate of bimetallism and an oppo
nent of monometallism, whether gold or
silver. Chandler pointed to the fact that
the world's production of gold and silver
in 1806 was $215,000,000 of each metal, and
his comment upon that fact was that it
seemed as if Providence â as if nature â as
if God himself â had interposed to refute
the prediction of those who had demanded
the demonetization of silvor o:i the ground
of its enormous overproduction.
Speaking of the Indianapolis conven
tion Mr. Chandler said that the respectable
and respected candidate of that conven
tion, bearing a standard with the motto,
"Gold Monometallism and Free Trade,"
had received 72b*. 000 votes out of over 14,
--000,000 votes, but that, nevertheless, the
assistance of those worthy and old-fash
ioned gentlemen in the election of McKin
iry had been glauly welcomed. Ii was
time for the passing away of the Demo
cratic party and those gentlemen were en
titled to perform an honorable part in the
obsequies.
In the further course of his remarks
Chandler referred to the position of Fetti
grew(K.) of South Dakota, speaking of
his nt'endtng the State Convention or
South Dakota, accepting his own delegate j
to the St. Louis Republican National
Convention, promising to abide by the
decision of that convention ana then re- j
pnaiatinz that convention. He charac
terized the course of Pettigrew as having
stamped him as "a hopeless silver mono
metalhst."
Petticrew asked him whether it was his
own statement, or was it a quotation.
Chandler replied that me statement
was derived Iroru the newspapers.
"I brand that statement," Pettigrew ex
claimed, "as absolutely, unqualifiedly
false in every particular. I made the
name denial in the Senate, before the St.
Louis convention, and it was published
in the Record, so that the Senator hns no
excuse for repeating the statement in his
speech to-day."
"The Â§enator says the statement is ab
solutely false" Chandler continued,
"therefore I understand him to Â«ay he
did not attend the South Dakota Repub
lican Convention; did not accept bis
election as a delegate to the St. Louis con
vention and did not declare that he would
ob-y the instructions of the State conven
tion.
"I say," Pettigrew returned, "that your
statement in the whole and the prin
ciples you intended to convey are abso
lutely false."
Chandler attempted to pin down the
Senator from South Dakota to hard facts,
which so uettleii the Senator that he sat
down with an air of great annoyance.
Subsequently Pettierew said: "The
South Dakota convention did not declare
lor 'sound money.' If it had it wouid not
have declared tor gold. It simply de
clared t :at it would refer the question of
bimetallism to the St. Louis convention.
But it made no declaration in favor of
w bat is wrongfully called ' sound
money.' "
Passing away from th-se personal refer
ence?", Chandler spoke of the declarations
of French, German and English public
men in favor of bimetallism, and asked
whether, in view of triese declarations,
the movement for international bimetal
lism had not a large chance of success.
He quoted from a speech of Senator
Sherman, made in 1876, to the effect that
nothing but an act o. God could destroy
the usÂ« of both gold and silver amonj; the
nations of mankind, and from a speech
of Secretary Carlisle, made in 1878, speak
ing of the demonetization of silver a* the
most giganti.l crime of this or any other
age; aud he ridded sarcastically that Sher
man in his new position as Secretary of
State wou d be an honored leader in the
new movement to save the country
and the world from the evils of mono
metallism.
In conclusion, Chandlersaid : "I d^clnrp
my b-'lief that President McKinley and
the other leaders of the party in their ad
vent to power may by wise decisions and
virtuous deeds infinitely prolong the
ascendency of the Republican party in
this country. This will surely be done by
making it the party of the people, to the
finel confusion and discomfiture of tho*e

pretendersâ "the blind leaders of the

of November iast, ail thrown into a ditch
together.
"If. on the contrary, this is not done,
\ and if the Republican party shall content
itself with seizing and enjoying the spoils
of office, >urrendering unreservedly to the
money power, acquiescing permanently in
the existing gold standard and treating
bimetallism as a 'juegling humbug' and
trie promise to promote it according to
the advice of the New York Sun, as a
pledge never intended to De fulfilled,
Republicans will speedily find the tide of
political battle turned against them and
they will soon regain the places which
their now sore, bleeding and prostrate
foes occupy.
"In the coming triumphant President,
hopeful and over confident, 'rejoicing as a
stronpr man to run a race' and to his
chosen advisers soon to challenge all the
' adverse currents of the luture, I cannot
[ help warningly saying concerning the
pending worldwide controversy over the
burning question of money: 'Unsettled
questions pay no heed to the repose of
nations. Be wise to-day: 'tis madness
to defer.' "
No action was taken or. the resolution,
which went back to the Vice- President's
table.
The sundry civil appropriation bill was
received from the House and referred 10
the Committee on Appropriations.
Tne Indian appropriation bill was taken
up and partly read. The reading was in
terrupted Dy a motion to proceed to the
consideration of executive business, which
was agreed to, and at 8:45 o'clock the gal
lerips were cleared and iho doors closed.
The doors were reopened at 4:15 o'clock
and legislative business resumed, when
the Senate bill for promoting Captain
William Tyndall. U. S. N., retired list, to
the rank of major was passed.
The bankruptcy bill was taken up, and
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts, in charge of
it, explained and advocated it. He esti
mated the number of bankrupts in the
United States at 500,00 . He thought it
would be a great pity if thÃt 51)0,000 of
bankrupts should have to go on in sorrow
and despair for the rest of their )ive< be- j
cau-e Congress had not skill enouah to
frame a measure wbicn would accomplish
a result desired in every humane, man.
In the course of his explanation of the
substitute reported from the Judiciary
Committee Hoar said that the "volun
tary" provisions of the bill could be re
sorted to by farmers, wage-earners and
such persons, while the "involuntary"
proceedings would apply to merchants,
traders and manufacturers.
'Without action on the bill the Senate,

Senate, were laid before the House md
the Senate amendments agreed to.
The bill was passed on recommendation
Oi the Committee on Patents making uni
form the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts
of the united States in case of the in
fringement of letters patent.
The rest of the day was spent in the
consideration of private pension bills,
about twenty-rive of them being passed.

a month each were the widows of Brevet
Major- General 8. A. Duncan, Colonel
Renea de Russy, Brigadier-General Charles

SAN JOSEANS ALLEGE FRAUD.
Traded Jfaluable Proper y for Land Which i
They Declare Cannot Be Culti
vated.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. 16.â George "VV.
Wilson and wife to-day began suit in the
Superior Court against C. H. Trim and D.
H. Bryant to have a conveyance of prop
erty declared void on account of fraud and
for $10,000 damages resulting therefrom.
On December 22. 1896, the Wilsons
traded 21)4 acres of land on the A urn
Rock road, six miles east of this city, to C.
H. Trim lor 640 acres near Pa-kenta, in
Teharna County. Trim agreed lo assume
a $2400 mortgage on the Wilson property.
The defendant represented the land in
Tehama County to be well watered and
that over one-half of it could be culti
vated, and he said it was of equal value to
the plaintiff's property. It was also rep
resented to 6Â« near a school and desirable
for a borne.
Wilson and hi? wife declare all these
representations to have been fals-e, and
claim the land to be almost worthless.
They allege that it is mountainous and
foil of deep, rocky gulches, and not over
twenty acres is fit for cultivation.
C. H. Trim to-day transferred thepron
erty obtained from the Wilsons to D. H.
Bryant, and for this reason the latter is
made a defendant to the suit.

STOCKTON'S QUEER DIVORCE CASE.
â \
Mrs. Coggeswell a Party Defendant m a
Suit Brought by Her Da ugh ter
m-Law.
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 16.- -The first
inning in the Van Pelt divorce suit was
contested in Judge Budd' a court yester
day. T. c case is an Interesting one ironi
a legal aspect, because Mrs. Van Peit has
not only sued Edwin S. Van Pelt, herhus
-sand, for a divorce, but has also sued her
mother-in-law as a party defendant, al
leging that Mr. Van Pelt transferred his
property to her just previous to the com
mencement of the suit to prevent his wile
from obtaining any portion of it.
Tue demurrer of Mrs. S. J. Coggeswell,
the mother- ui-law, came up for hearing.
Besides alleging the formal ground ;hat
the complaint uid not state facts suffi
cient to constitute a cause 01 action, it was
claimed tnat there was a misjoinder of
the parties defendant, inasmuch ab Mrs.
Coggesweli was not a necessary or proper
defendant in an action lor divorce. It,
was declared that several causes of actiou
had been improperly joined.
Judge Budd overruled the demurrer,
thereby sustaining the complaint. Such 1
a suit as the present is very unusual, there,/
beintr but a single similar one in the Cali
fornia .Reports.

Further Complications Grow Out o.
the F.efusal of the Governor to
Sign the Appropriation.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 16.â
employes of the State Printing Office and
the State Book bindery, who, by reason of
being discharged the other day, found
time to attend the morning session of the
Assembly, were sorely disappointed, for
the battle of the types and presses, the
statesmen and the Jawbooks was again
deferred until to-morrow morning at 11
o'clock.
There \v;.a only a slight skirmish to-day
by the advance pickets just outside the
majority trocha, the first cun being fired
by the Committee on Printing, to which |
had been referred Dibble's two bills, al
lowing $40,000 in one and $35,000 in the
other to the State Printing Ollice. The J
committee reported a substitute for both j
in the shape of a bill appropriating
$75,000. The committee reported back
Caminetti's resolution, asking the State j
Printer to furnish the House with a list of i
the names of the persons discharged by I
the State Printer, together with the names i
of the persons upon whose recommenda
tion those employes had been appointed
by the printer, and the committee sug
gested the reference of the resolution to
the special committee on investigation.
Caminetti's resolution was intended for
the manufacture of political thunder to
hurl upon the head of the printer for hav
ing discharged Democratic employes and
retained Republican ones when he was
obliged to cut down his force by reason of
lack of funds.
Caminetti is really a very funny little j
man. He is the funniest man in Sacra- ]
mento, and there are a whole lot of funny j
men liere. He belongs to a party whose
motto is "To the victor belong the spoils,"
' and yet he is acting in tnii matter as
though he desired to prove that the State
Printer should discharge all the Republi
cans and keep only the Democrats on
guard, because, forsooth, the Democratic
Governor and the Democratic legislators â 
hid refused to furnish the oilice with suf- j
ficient tunds to keep the full force em
ployed! Now, if that isn't funny this j
world is a revolving funeral.
The funny man, of course, raised an ob
jection. He thought it was funny that
the committee should recommend that
' his resolution should bo referred to a
committee not yet in existence, and
Speaker Coombs, oblivious of the joice, in
qui:ed whether a public officer elected by
me people could be required to furnish ,
the names cf persons discharged by Dim. j
Bridgford came to the rescue... He said |
â  at the charge bad been made that the
State Printer had attempted to intimidate
members of the Assembly by discharging j
persons who hail been unpointed at their j
suggestion, and the resolution should be '
adopted.
The report of the committee was ignored i
and Caminetti's resolution c tiling for an |
investigation was put to the vote and de- i
feated, the vote being 28 ayes and 39 noes. !
Then the whole subject matter was laid :
over until 11 o'clock this morning.
Controller Colgan, next after the dis
charged employes, was Hie first to feel the
effect of the shortage of funds in Â»he State
Pi inter's office. He sent down yesterday j
an order for 200 warrants and 500 vouchers. I
The order was returned to the Controller |
with the following indorsement: "Re
spectfully declined for lack of funds. A. J.
Johnston, by H."
The Controller was angry. It was the
first lime that anything of "the kind had
been done to him"and the top of his head
became rosy with indignation. The result
of his cogitations was the following letter
to the State Board of Examiners:
To the ll' able the State Hoard of Examiners,
Sacramento, Cat.â Gentlemen: 1 beg to i close
herewith two orders on me Superintendent of
State Printing for printing necessary for my
cflice, which have been returned to mewi'h
the notation attached thereto. Under the pro
visions of section 531. Political Code, as
amended in 18'J5 (statutes 1895, page 233), in
the event that a State officer shall consider
the decision of the Superintendent of Stale i
Printing unfair in his declination of an order i
for printing he may refer the matter to the
State Board of Examiners, which board shall
determine the matter. This decision of the
Superintendent of State Printing 1 consider !
unfair and unwarranted, against public policy
and detrimental to the proper conductor the '
business of the State. 1 therefore reler the
matter to your honorable board, with the re
quest that the Superintendent of state Print
ing be required to fill this order at once.
State Printer Johnston, when asxed by a
Call reporter this afternoon as to the
reasons why he had cut off the Con
troller's printing, replied that he had
given instructions only to do such State
woik as was absolutely necessary for the
running of the State government until
the Legislature made some provision for
paying the hands employed in is office.
"I have been compelled by reason of i
the lack of funds," he said, "to cut off
some men and to phalanx others. 1 j
.-hould cut off a Inree number more, only
for the fact that I have a very large quan
tity of legislative work on hand. I must
do the work for the Legislature and for
the Supreme Court at all hazards, be- !
cause these departments must go on no
matter what the cost or trouble may be.
I shall do the best I can under the cir
cumstances."
Eugene S. Had ley, bookkeeper . for the |
State Pr.ming Office, said that Cami
netti's statement that the accounts of the
Controller did not tally with those of the
State Printer was unfounded. Tho state
ment also that neither Hadley nor
Johnston could explain the discrepancy i
.was denied.
'â¢"What I did say," said Hadley, "was:
â¢I will not attempt to make any explana
tion of a shortage such as you claim.' j
Caminetti said: 'If I come to you to- I
morrow mornine. will you try to explain?' j
and I said, 'I will.' I will say further
tnat our books and those of the Controller I
balance correctly to a cent."
The explanation made by JHadley is
this: In the report of the State Printer
irom July 1, 1894, to June 30, 1896, ap
pears on page 22 a table of expenses of the
office, such as composition em pi yes, $44,
--551 95; engravine employes, $10,090; re- ]
pairs, etc., the whole aceregating $140,000. j
Under the beading, 'â¢Printing for Depart- j
ments. Institutions," etc., beginning on
page 28, is a statement of the cost of work j
done for each department by the Priming
Office. In this statement the items of in
surance, plumbing, etc., do not appear,
and therefoie the total does not foot up !
$116,000. Caminetti, whose forte doing
politics and not bookkeeping, jumped to
the conclusion that there was a shortage
of $50,000, although bow Ibis could have
happened when the State Printer neither
receives nor disburses a dollar the gentle
man from Amador cannot explain. Had
ley presents the following as explaining
the mare's-nest shortage discovered by
the ex-Congressman: .
Total expenditures from appropriation
for forty-seyenth fiscal year, $146,000 59.
distributed as follows: Printing for de
partments, etc., 982,25780; lithographing
for departments, etc. , .I!4c>sÃ '-'0; sioik and
labor lor thirty-first session of Legislature
in excess of their appropriation, $23,008 63;
permanent material, $6950 32; repairs,
r>lum bine, fixtures and improvements,
$0048 56; vaiue of stock on hand. $15,69848:
insurance, $1342 40; total, $143,864 39. leav
ing a balance of $2136 20, which was for
expenses incurred in making th" change
of the bindery and coruposina-rooni. The
entire expenditure of $146,000, however,
is made by warrant drawn on the Treas
urer by the Controller after approval by
the Board of Examiners. This supervi
sion extends to alt payrolls, as well as to
all bills, no matter how small.
State Controller Cnlgan said that what
the Governor wanted the State Printer to
! show wÂ»s when Joun Doe, for instance,
I drew $45 for composition wnat amount of
matter did he >et up for that amount of
money. This would be impracticable !n
individual casfs, but tho a^gre^ate num
ber of ems, etc., could be shown on each
payroll.
"Perhaps the trouble with Johnston is
that he is not charging enough tor his
printing, and is not including repairs,
wear and tear and other necessary ex
pense in the co.-t of his work,'' added Col
gan.
Colgan denied that he had used swear
words when bis order was returned to him
as "declined with thanks" and "not avail
able." He said he never swore except
when giving testimony in court. The
refusal of the printer to do his work had
not hampered him any as he always kept
a stock on hand, but if an appropriation
was not granted very soon his work would
be seriously cripi led, because he was
obliged to completely change ail his books
on the Ist of July.
Considerable feeling is being developed
in the controver.-v, and some of it cropped
out to-day when Assemblyman Hill offered
the following resolution:
Rrsohrrt, That the Governor of this state b. 1
requested to inform the Assembly within five
dnysof the amount ol his pttrouaire in the
| state Printing t>fii'-e und of the number and
i names of the pernons Â«:io have been employed
in said printing office ai h s instance or request.
Speaker Coombt declared the resolution
i out of or.ier. It broke in upon that
I divinity wit ion doth hedge in a Governor
and was not considered respectful.
The Republican caucus this eveninc
â  decided to withdraw the bill appropriate
' ing $75,000 for th* Stale Printing Office
I and to -Ã¼bsiitute D bble's two bills â one
j for $40,000 and the other for $35,000. The
) majority will thus force the minority to
| eat crow while Leatine the devil around
! the stump. The msnibers of the caucus
; were sworn to secrecy.

An Amendment to the Civil Code 1m
/>eeotn mended.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 16.â 1n com
pliance with the request made by Judge
Sterry on behalf of the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe the Judiciary Committee of
the Senate agreed to recommend the
passage of an amendmct to the Civil Code
which, will give the company mentioned
the right to purchase and operate the At
lantic and Pacific Railroad when it is
sold under a decree of foreclosure. The
amendment is to section 165 of the C>vil
Code dehning powers of raiiroad corpora
tions and is as follows:
To purchase any railroad or pnrt thereof,
lands, franchises, rights, privilege*, powers
ami immunities of any raiiroad corporation

whole or in part in the Slate of California,
which may be sold by virtue of any mortgage
or dee 1 of trust, or pursuant 10 the judgment
or decree ou execution ol any court oi com

When a purchase is made of any railroad, or
part thereof, or lands, franchises, rights, priv

TACOMA LAWYER'S GRIEVANCE.
Brings Surt for D-mcgss Because He
Was Attacked in an Answer to a
Complaint.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 16.â 1n the
United States court to-day the trial of
Attorney Jesse Thomas' $10,000 damage
suit against the Union Mutual L fe Insur
ance Company, which is represented here
through n San Francisco insurance firm,
was commenced. In 1894 Thomas was as
sociated with Leroy and George Palmer in
ths practice of law.
At that time the Palmers were engaged
by Johanna C. Martin to begin suit
| against tne Union Mutual for the collec
! tion of a $1000 policy on the life of her
husband. The case was won by the com
i nany on a technicality, and the present
' suit of Thomas for damages is based upon
! matter contained in the company's
answer. Tho language objected to Ly
Thomas is quoted as follows:
"At about the first <iay of S pember,
A. D. 1894, the said Johanna C. Martin,
plaintiff in this action, and Palmer &
Thomas, attorneys for the plaintiff, en
tered into an agreement and conspiracy to
carry out the uereement formerly made
between the snid Jonas Martin and the
said Johanna C. Martin to defraud this
defendant of the sum of $1090."
It was further alleged by the company
that Palmer and Thomas had no knowl
; edge of Martin's death, but claimed him
[ to be dead for the sole purpose of carrying
i out the alleged conspiracy. The court
ordered thjsportion of the answer stricken
out, and the company is now endeavoring
to show that since tlie allegation was con
tained in a legal document Attorney
! Thomas lias no rieht to recover damages.
Thomas claims that the publication of
ttie derogatory matter about him has
embarrassed and crippled his law prac-
I tice; hence his request for heavy damages.
j Should bÂ»Â« win, it is considered probable
that the Palmer brothers would also be
entitled to damages, if they desired to
bring suits against the company.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 18f>7.
GOVERNOR BUDD
VETOES TWO BILLS
Objects to Giving Increased
Powers to Trustees
of Towns.
Thinks the People Should Vote
on the Â£Ã¼bj?ct of New
Improvements.
In a Second Message the Chief-Ex
ecutive Says That No Money
Should Be Sent to N.ishvi:!?.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 16.â Two
veto messages from the Governor varied
the monotony of the Senate proceedings
to-day.
One of the bills disapproved by Gover
nor Budd is Senate bill 9, introduced by
Senator Beard and relating to the powers
of the trustees of the cities of Alameila,
Berkeley and others in the same class.
The Governor is of the opinion that the
powers conferred by the bill are too broad
to be safely placed in the hands of a board
of trustee*. He suggests some amend
ments, and intimates that in the amended
i form the measure would receive his sig
nature. The text of this veto message
follows:
The amendment made by this bill to the
existing; laws governing municipalities of the
class therein designated, adds to section 3 the
foi owing words: "To purchase, lease or con
struct water works and electric plants, and all
machinery, conductors and appliances neces
sary thereior and to supply such city with and
to .sell to the inhabitants thereof, water, light,
heat and power, etc.." thus giving to the
Boarl o: Trustees of gucli city greatly
increased powers. 1 very seriously doubt the
advisability of conferring upon* Boards of
Trustees the power, etc., "to purchase, .ease or
construct water works and electric plants, and
all the machinery, conductors and appliances
necessary therefor," unless the proposition to
so purelia.-e, lease or construct be submitted
to me legal voters oÂ» such ciiy at either a gen
eral or special election, and tneir approval of
such proposition be given by such vote.
It will be recognized that while this power
is in some cases limited by the constitution
and by other sections of the law, still there
are no limitations in the section itself. It is
ttie latest expression of the legislative will
upon me subject, and the other limitations
might be often easily overcome by governing
bod
The purpose of the act Is undoubtedly a most
commendable oDe, but the extent ot the cost
should first be ascertained and the question
submitted to the people as to whether they de
sire to so build, or purchase, or lease, and to
assume tne additional tax necessary for siiid
purposes. A limitation fen this section by a
proviso Hint the water wonts, electric plants
and all machinery, conductors and appliances
necessary tberefor shnll not exceed in price
the sum of from $10,000 to (15,000 would un
doubtedly relie\ c the bill of many of its objec
tionable features.
If a further proviso was added that in all
cases where '.ne estimated cost and expense
necessary for the purchase, lease or construc
tion of such plants or the erection of such
works exceeded said sums the proposition
should be submitted to the people for their
votes, tbe act would be further improved.
Without such safeguards it can be easily seen
what temptations will be offered persons or
corporations owning water works, o'ectric
plants or similar property, to influence
trustees or councilmcu to purchase or lease
said works or plants for the City, at an extrav
agant cost or upon the conditions wtmh the
taxpayers, who will have to psy for them,
would not sanction, and might vigorously op
pose. To give the power conferred by this bill
to boards of trustees or Councilman! without
the express sanction of a vote of the people,
who will have to meet the cost of the contem
plated purchase or lease is dangerous and
would prove unsatisfactory, and in many in
stances oppressive. With tho amendment sug
gested I can see no objection to the bill, and in
such amended form would be pleased to see it
become a law.
Motives of economy prompted Governor
Budd to write his veto on Senate bill 133,
introduced by Senator Smith. This is an
act appropriating money to pay the ex
penses of collecting, preparing, forward
ing, installing and maintaining, taking
down and returning an exhibit of the
products of the State of California at the
Tennessee Centennial Exposition to be
held in Nashville in 1&97. This is the
Governor's language disapproving the
measure:
I soriou'ly doubt the advisability of ex
penditures of the character contemplated by
th Dill. Exhibition* of a similar nature to
the Nashville Centennial osition are held
with comparative frequency within the United
States, imd while tueir purpose li laudable
and their maintenance advantageous a State
appropriation to maintain an exhibition at
each of them would result in a great aggre
gate expenditure without a resulting general
benefit.
1 have but recently approved of an appro
priation for the maintenance of an exhibition !
at Guatemala, but the cases are not parallel.
Guatemala is a foreign country, new and in
process of rapid development. Her markets
arc in a receptive condition, ready to be ap
propriated by the most enterprising foreign
countries. Our country is rich In the products
which her people consume; her market* are
convenient to our shores, and I believe it ad
visable'hat this State should expend a lim
ited sum In the development of a market so
convenient of Â«cceÂ«s and s> rich In its prom
ise. The Nashville Exposition, upon the con
trary, is within the borders of a sister State, i
already familiar with our products and * pur
chaser of our commodities. That the con- !
sumption of the products of our soil and their !
sale mar be promoted by this and similar ex
hibitions 1 do not deny; but when we consider
the frequency with which such exhibitions
are held, that they are conducted by our own
peop.e, within the confines of our own coun
try, and that to appropriate money to exhibit
at one would establish a precedent for an ap
propriation for nil, 1 tesl constrained to with
hold my consent to this bill.
We have heretofore appropriated $300,000 ''â¢
for an exhibition of our various products and
resources at Chicago and $10,000 for an exhi- i
bition at New Orleans. These exhibitions '
were international, and tho conditions sur
rounding them were such as justified the ex
penditure. They resulted in advertising our
resources within the limits of the United States '
to an extent which renders unnecessary the I
enactment of Senate bill 138. The proposed
exhibition at Nashville lacks the features
which, distinguished those at Chicago and
New Orleans.
in view of the great expenses which appro
priation* imilar to the one contemplated by
this bill might ultimately entail I am con
vinced that the general welfare will be best
subserved by leaving to private enterprise the
development ol our domestic markets.

Contempt T roreedtno* nnd Other Mat
ter Considered, in Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 16.â Several
important measures were considered and
actei upon to-night by the Senate Com
, mittee on Constitutional Amendment".
! Most of the session was occupied with
| listening to the arguments of V. S. Mc
| Clatchy of tbe Bee in favor of and of
Judge Catlin against the constitutional
\ amendment providing as follows:
No speech or publication reflecting upon or
! concerniug any court or any officer thereof
j shall be treated or punished as a contempt of
I curt unless made in the immediate pre>ence
j of such court while in session, and in such a
j manner as to actually interfere with its pro
\ ccedings.
The matter was taken under advisement i
and Chairman Bert of the committee was |
elected a committee of one to learn from
the Supreme Court whet; er itsdecision in
J the McClatchy contempt case would be
I handed down before tne close cf the srs
! sion of the Legislature, as on tlie decision
| of the Supreme Court in this matter will
I probably det>end thÂ« action of the com-
I mittee. If the Supreme Court declares
| what is known as the Barry contempt law
unconstitutional it is believed the com
mittee will fnvor the proposed constitu
tional amendment. Otherwise it will be
disapproved.
The committee decided to report back
without any recommendation the amend
ment providing that the clerk of the As
sembly and the secretary of the Senate
I shall appoint all th* legislative attaches,
| and that tbe per diem of such attaches
: shall not in the aggregate exceed $200.
Tbe code commission amendment pro

tax ot $300 a year on every saloon, regard

such tenants with meters and gas.

CORBETT ENTERS
NEVADA'S CAPITAL
Welcomed as a Sovereign
Going Forth Among His
People.
Places a Bet at Two to One
That He Will Lower the
Colors of Fitzsimmons.
Both the Champion and Martin Julian
Submit to Interviews for
"The Call."
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 16.â "1f any one
or two newspapers assert that I have sold
to either or both of them the exclusive
* privilege of having interviews with me
durinc my period of training for the bat
tle with Fitzsimmons, it or they state
what is wholly untrue," was the emphatic
declaration made by Champion Jarues J.
Corbett to-day* shortly after sitting loot
in Carson. Although none of the contin
gent of correspondents now here both
ered themselves sufficiently to take any
stock in the advertised boast of one San
Francisco and one New York newspaper,
still it was in the nature of a relief to
hear it direct from Corbett's mouth that
he had not loaned himself to any such
scheme.
"Why, I would be an idiot to do such a
thint;," ke continued. "I would have
the rest of the newspaper world down on
my bead, and that is something that a per
son following my profession never should
invite. No, I simply signed a contract to
furnish a few signed statements during
my training, stating over my own signa
ture, you know, just how I am progress
ing with my work and how I am
feeling. Tho representatives of any and
all other newspapers can see me either be
fore or after the making of these state
ments and I will tell them the same thing.
There is going to be no 'hogging' of any
news, so far as I am concerned. I was
offered money for this signed statement
privilege, and I would have been foolish
to overlook such a good snap. 1 1 is easy
money â cold turkey, in fact. I am the
gainer, and nobody will be hurt by it."
Martin Julian, who followed the pom
pad Dured boxer into town, practically
echoed Corbett's words when asked as to
the matter of exclusive interviews with
him.
"That's quite a funny thing," laughed
the jolly little manager of the Australian.
"I received a wad of money from some
body who seemed anxious to get rid of i^,
and alone with this came a request that
we exclude all interviewers except those
representine the donor of this wallet. Of
course it would have been foolish to have
entered into such an agreement, but when
as a compromise it was proposed that we â 
iurnish only signed statements, why we
snapped at it. "Who wouldn't? It was
like finding the money.
"No, sir; Fitzsimmons and I havealways
been open and aboveboard in all our
actions, and we are not going to begin
playing dirty little tricks at this stage of
the game. We have always welcomed the
members of the press to our training
quarters and given them every facility for
ascertaining just how earnestly we are
working and that we always mean business
in our undertakings. It would be a fine
how-do-you-do if we should hold ourselves
alooJ as sacred to only one or two news
papers, wouldn't it? We are not built
that way."
Aa to the exclusive photograph yarn,
Corbett and Julian had similar remarks to
make. Corbett said he had given a San
Francisco photographer the exclusive con
cession for a good, stiS price, but not to
anyone wspaper.
"That was one of those snaps, like the
other proposition," said the genial James.
"Of course, I told the photographer that
he could have the privilege and I got my
money for it, but I did not agree to keep
in hiding all the time or surround myself
with a cordon of Texas rangers to keep off
photographic poachers. Do you see the
itoiut? All richt, isn't it? I don't
imagine that in the event some outside
camera sharp should steal in on the con
cessionaire's preserves I would jump over
the moon in order to avoid him. Now.
that's all there is to the thing. These
people with privilege!" will have to look
after their privileges, for I have other and
far more important matters to attend to
just now."
The arrival of Corbett and his retinue
and of Manager Martin Julian, unat
tended, were the events of to-day in Car
son. As if all h&d been neatly pro
grammed, they came on separate trains,
so that each had a fair and just inning.
The famous San Franciscan had the dis
tinction of being first on the ground, com
isig in on the morning train. He was not
unexpected by any means, for )t seemed
as if all Carson had turned out and braved
the drizzling rain to have a squint at the
pale-.'aced young man who proclaims to
the world that he is going to thump
"Lanky Bob into an unrecognizable
jumble of broken bones and lacerated
flesh. Bold camera fiend?, unmindful of
the brag that only one man in the world
should "snoot" the champion, were
â¢ perched upon awnings and strung along
the depot platform, all cocked and primed
for the prey.
Corbett sought to evade the densest part
of the crowd by stepping off the rear plat
form of the last car instead of aliaming
directly upon the platform, but his tall
frame and broad shoulders were too easily
distinguishable, and it was only a matter
of a few seconds when he was the center
of a great surging and enthusiastic throng.
The clicking of the cameras told, too, the
story of the fiends' triumph. The big fei
low took it all good-naturedly â in fact en
joyed the attention bestowed on him.
ilcre and there discovering a familiar face
in the crowd he would reach forward for a
hearty shake, or if the acquaintance hap
pened to have been jostled out to the edt:e
of the tramping concourse a wave of the
hand and a smile was his greeting.
The crowd essayed to escort James J.
right into the Arlington Hotel, his tem
porary stopping-place, but the Arlington,
while being roomy, will not accommodate
the whole town of Carson, and somebody,
the last of the procession, was doomed to
stand outside in the rain and be content
with an occasional glimpse at the Olympic
Club idol through the panes of the big
frontdoor. Corbett was accompanied by
his brothers. Harry and Joe, "Big Jack"
McVey and "Dumpy" Fraser. "BiHy"
Delaney remained in San Francisco so as
to bring Jeffries along.
They had no sooner shed their overcoats
and dropped their valises than "Jim"
espied a billiard-table in the rear room. |
He challenged his brother Joe to a game,
and that Â»aÂ« a signal for the swaying
crowd to shufile out of the office and "into
positions surrounding the billiarJ-table.
"Jim" said he would "do" Joe and kept
his word.
Then the cues were dropped and all
hands lolled around, making new ac
quaintances, receiving old ones, taking
Â«dvice about avoiding colds in this eh- |
ir.ate and tellir.g how they felt; and then, |
just to snow that he9till could talk, James
J. submitted to an interview at the hands
of a Cam, correspondent.
"I had hoped,' said he, "to be able to
jro right out to my training quarters as i
soon a< I arrived, but this rain has lorced
me to change my plans. I will not go out
there until to-moirow. They tell me I
have a nice place at Shaws Springs â the
best around there. I hope I will be
pleased, for a fellow's surroundings have
a great deal to do with the success oi his
training. How is mv handball court
getting along? When I see that finished
and ready for business then I will be
happy, for that means that I can go to
work. lam anxious to get to work, too,
for I get lazy when I rest too mucn. An
all-night trip iv the cars makes one want
to get out and jump arouud and shako his
arms and legs.
"Speaking of the cars, we had a great
trip up from San Francisco. I was greeted
by friends at almost every station. The
greatest oi all the receptions, however,
was at Suisun. There we found several
hundred cheering and shouting people at
the station, and I had to get out and
shake hands with as many as I could be
fore the train started. They had a brass
band with them and a cannon, so between
the cheering, the blare of brass and the
booming of the field-piece I could scarcely
hear myself think. It was a great send
off, and I tell you 1 appreciated it, for I
knew it was genuine and spontaneous. If
Fitzsimmons should by some hook or
crook lick mÂ« I would go around Suisun
on my way back from Carson. I would
not have the heart to lo;>k those good
friends in the face. At Sacramento I got
another send-off, many of the Senators and
Assemblymen being at the depot to wish
me luck, and so it was all along the line
until it got so late that all good people
were huddling in their beds and I had
sought my sleeper.
"1 hope to begin my training to-morrow.
Everything will depend upon the condi
tion of my quarters at the springs. I
don't thinK the snow on the ground will
interfere much with my wort. I rather I
like it, as it seems invigorating. It is |
great weather tor handball playing, j
Snowball playing mi^ht be appropriate,
too. I don't need a great deal ot heavy \
training, for I am in almost first-class
condition right now. I never :elt better |
and stronger in all my life. lam sincere
about this, and I feel so confident of com
ing out victorious in this battle mat I
scarcely have the patience to wait until
St. Patrick's day so anxious am I to get at
that long-legged Australian. My dream
of years seems about to be realized, and
that is to get Fitzsimmons into the same
ring with me. 1 know this sounds windy
and braggish, but 1 can't help it, because I
mean it. I never really expected to see
Fitzsimmons come to the scratch, and my
most earnest wish now is that no acci
dent- will occur nor obstacles arise which
might postpone the match or declare it
off. If we can but get into the ring to
gether yon will see me win all the money.
I feel strong enough right now to defeat
two or three men lite Fitzsimmons all in
the day."
So much for James J. Corbett.
Now, when Martin Julian arrived on
this afternoon's train it was not raining â
but snowing. It was by no means a
"frost" for Fitzsimmons 1 gallant and
snappy little manager, however, for there
was quite a crowd down at the station ;o
meet him.
"Whew! This is eoing to be tough for
training," said Martin, as he stepped off
| the car and found the snow fuil* ankle
deep on the ground.
Julian also went to the Arlington, and
so did the crowd. He dirt not meet Cor
bett there, as the man with the pompa
dour was "Just then engaged in an ani
mated game of whist down at Al Living
ston's resort. But that did not troubie
Julian any. He remarked that he did not
care if he did not see James until the day
oi ih - light. The man he did want to see,
though, was Dan Stuart, but Dan was at
the time invisible, and his lieutenant,
Wheelock, had to ?tand In his stead.
Julian whispered for about ten minutes
with WheelocK, exchanged some mysteri
ous-looking documents wiili him, and
then announced that he was ready to see
the town. He was taken into tow by a
friend, and soon fell in with Harry Cor- j
bett, "Billy" Woods, Livingston and sev- i
eral other sports, and got along nicely
with them. When interviewed this even
ing on the subject that is uppermost in
every mind in Carton just now â the
fight â Julian had this to say:
"I left Fitzsimmons in Coloradoin mag
nificent health and perfect condition. He
is ready to fight right now, for that mat
ter. He has been giving exhibition's lately
in altitudes quite as high aa Carson, and
they do not affect his lungs a particle. He
was the only one in our party who was
not affected. He gives a show to-night in
Leadville â Drobably his last before the big
fight. Now, Fttz is not going to rusu
right up here to Carson just to walk
around showing himself and have nothing
to do.
"You see we have secured no tcaining
quarters ytt. The agreement between us
is that he will <irop off at a certain iittle \
town on t;.e road and stay there until I i
have selected a training place. Then I
win wire him to come on and he will go
jto work immediately upon his arrival. I
think I will select a place <iuite close to
Carson. I want my man to train in the
air iv which he is to tight. I stopped eff
at steamboat Hot Springs on my way
here and was not favorably impresse 1 with
the place. I will look around to-morrow
and I euesi i will find a suitable location.
We are not such particular folks anyhow,
you know.
"As to the probable outcome of the
fi~hi, I can oniy repeat what I have i
often said before â Fitz is going to win in a j
walk. Just before leaving New York I i
made a bet of $1000 with a party that my
man would go to the ring an odas-on
favorite in the betting on the 17th of
March. Outside of New York City, where
Corbett has lots of friends, the preponder
ance oi the money will go in on Fitzsim
mons. The tall fellow has been in active
training ever since the articles of agree
ment were signed, and he is training new
on the road. He is delighted with the
prospect of getting into the ring with this
blowhard, Corbett. It is what he ha^
wanted for a long time â in fact what he
has pra3'ed for â and it is not going to take
Kitz long to polish him off. either. Just
mark wnat I say on that point. He is go-"
ing to show tliit fellow just how big a dub
he is, and the easiest way to do that is to ]
serve him as lie did Maher and others â j
put him out in a punch."
Although there have been anxious in- i
qtiiries all day for Dan Stuart, the director- i
general as he is now called, that impor
tant individual lia^ not been once in evi
dence. Not ev-n the fact that Corbett and
Julian had arrived, ami that both were
anxious to see him. had the effect of
I bringing him from under covÂ»r. The rea- j
I son for thi-i is that Dan has been closeted I
all day with three architects, who are en- I
deavorinz to plan the style of pavilion he I
desir< for t&e big mill. Steart now in
tends 10 have a more elaborate building
constructed than he at first intended.
Ground will probably be broken at the
racetrack on Thursday or Friday.
Corbett's presence in Carson has had
the immediate effect of causing a revival
in belting. This evening Frank Golden, a
well-known jeweler of Carson and Nevada
City, offered to wager $500 that he could
find backing for Fiizsimmons to the ex
tent of $18,000 or even more within twenty- /
four hours. Corbett hoard of the proposi
tion and offered to accept the wager.
Golden was inclined to flunk. After a
heated argument Corbett offered to make
the jeweler a present of $s if he would risk
$100 even that Fiizsimmons would win.
Tnis wager Golden accepted. Then
"Jim" became insistent and wagered $300
against $100, which Golden also took up
tfter a conference witu Martin Julian.
Corbett stepped up to the hoiel office
counter, where the pair were conversing,
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1597.
and offered to bet Julian to a stand-still.
Fiizsimmons* manager repudiated any
connection with Golden and begged to be
excused. As a clincher, Corbett placed $100
on the counter, which he offered to hafe
ard that Golden could not produce $1003
with which to back Fitzsimmons at even
money within ten days. Golden withdrew.
Eddie Cooke received a telegram from
W. A. Brady, Corbett's theatrioal part
ner, to-day in which William says he will
leave Boston for Carson on the 20th i'lst.
Brady wires that he has bet $7(500 in New
York at odds of 10 to 8 on "Pompadour
Jiui." He will bring more money out
here with him.
Colonel C. F. Burns of San Francisco ar
rived here to-day to make arrangements
for a series of special Pullman trains to
bring visitors to the fight. He says that
indications now are that, at the outside,
2500 p ople will coma from San Francisco.
He expects 5000 from the State of Cali
fornia.

Champion's I'roxrrss.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa.. Feb. 16.â John
L. Sullivan arrived in Philadelphia to
day. He will be tendered a benefit to
morrow night at the Quaker City Athletic
Club, when he will appear in a four-raund
bout with Paddy Ryan, his first opponent
for the championship. "When asKed for
hia opinion on the coming light between
Corbett and Fitzsimmons he said :
"I certainly think Corbett will win, for
he is a level-headed chap and has had lots
of experience. He has improved a lot
since he fought me in New Orleans, and
even at that time he was a wonder. Then
he could not hit very hard, but he has
since developed his bitting powers until
now he is able to hold up his end with any
of them. Then, again, Fitzsimmons is
not able to hold his end up with a man
who is so long-headed as Corbett, and the
Australian is liable to go to pieces at any
stage of the game. If you have noticed,
Corbett has always shown *reat cleverness
in making matches and I will say that
this one is no exception to his general
rule.
"Now-a-days the public will stnnd far
more from a fighter than in my day.
When I was champion the public de
manded that I should fight whenever a
candidate made his appearance ; but times
have changed, and these two fellows have
had two years' cheap advertising before
getting down to business To my mind
Corbett was willing to fight at any time,
but Fitzsimmons seemed to have had
great trouble in screwing up his courage
to a sticking point. He could easily have
eluded the authorities at Hot Springs, but
instead of that he purposely had himself
arrested, so as to have the fight stopped.
He has never made any efforts to get on a
fight with Corbett, and I don't believe he
would go on with the present match if he
had not been forced to by the public."
Sullivan will remain here until Thurs
day, when he will return to Gloncester,
Mass., to appear with a vaudeville
company.

LEADVILLE, Colo., Feb. 16. â The
Western Opera-house was packed to-night
to see Fitzsimmons and his sparring part
ner, Dan HicKey, give an exhibition.
J. H. Shoemaker, representing Martin
Julian, had decided to give an exhibition
at Glenwood to-morrow night, instead of
making the the long jump to Salt Lake
City without interruption. Thursday
night the party wilt arrive at the latter
place, where a performance will be given,
and from that point a through trip wili be
made to Carson, the party arriving Satur
day morning, and going immediately into
training quarters. Fitzsimmons said to
night: '
"I find myself, at an altitude of over
100C0 feet above the level of the sea and
in possession of a slight cold, due entirely
to the sudden changes of temperature
which I have passed through. Apart from
that I am as sound as a boll and in perfect
health.
"I would like to express myself regard- ,
i ing Mr. Siler's intention to issue the rules
governing the fight ten days before the
contest. A? a matter of fact, the Marquis
of Queensberry rules governin{~Â»contesis
are known to the profession to-day and
are understood, and it is my opinion that
any departure from these rules could be
best set before the principals one day
ahead of the contest, so that there would
be no chance to practice."

CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 16.â The Western
railroads have been asked to approve of a
rate of $84 80 for :he round trip to Nevada

JEFF RIES JO MEbT 31 AH EX.
Dan Stuart" Unknown Said to Be the
Jon Amir)** I.ntl,
Dan Stuart, late of Texas, but now of
Carson, Nov., has telegraphed to Peter
Mai.er, the champion Irish heavy-weight
pugilist, to keep himself in good trim, ri
he may be matched to meet an unknown
some time during the week of the pugi
listic carnival in Carson City. Stuart had
an idea that he could book Livigne and
W alcott as one of the attractions for the
[ great sporting event, but a message from
j Sam Fitzpatrick, who is Lavigne's man
j ager, to Stuart decided thai question be
yond all doubt. Fitzpatrick said tout he
would not consent to a meeting between
Watcott and Lavigne, and. after the re
ceipt of tbe information Stuart tele
graphed to Peter Maher and received a
very satisfactory reply.
Now, the general opinion is that Stuart
intends to match Tom Sharkey against
the Irishman, but a representative of The â 
Call learned last evening that Sharkey
will not "cut any ice" in the fistic carni- '
val of St. Patrick's day, and that the man
who will be name I later to meet Maher is
none other than "Jim" Jeffries, the crack
" ajack i.eavy-weight of Los Angeles.
Stuart has beard very favorable reports \
! of Jeffries from men who are acknowl- \
j edged to be good judges of boxers, and he
, therefore rates him as being a far better
! man than Sharkey; but with nil due re- |
I spect to Mr. Stuart and the men who have j
advised him . regarding Jeffries' qualifica- ;
tion*, the young man from the orange j
groves is yet very inexperienced, and j
would not make much of a showing ;
against the quick and hard-hitting son of
tho Emerald Isle.
Jeffries is undoubtedly a good man and j
I should make a first-class pugilist after he '
| has had experience, but he is now entirely |
too slow for a man of Maher'a caliber,
and, as a matter of fact, the result of a
contest between "Jim" and Peter would '
not give general satisfaction.
A "go" between Maher and Sharkey i
would not prove satisfactory either, as the
Irishman, by a few quick move?, would
find an opening to the sailor's jaw and |
the result need not be stated.
If Stuart is looking for a good second !
attraction he should match George Green
I against the winner of the Ryan-Tracey
fight, and then he can count upon a game
of fisticuffs that will please the immense
gathering of people who will be at the
ringside to see the best men win.

"JIM" CORBIJTT'S MASCOT.
He Mat TakÂ«n With Him to JSeratia a
Beautiful Colt*'.
There are very few sporting people in
this City who have not had the pleasure
of seeing Harry CorbeU's beautiful collie
dog, for which he has repeatedly refused
very tempting offers. But Harry is no
longer the owner of the intelligent canine.
It Is now the property of the champion
pugilist, and in iuture it will be known as
"Jim's" Mascot.
When the man wno is to meet Fitzsim
mons on the aftenioon of March 17, ar
rived in this City last week, he received a
very warm reception from the collie the
moment he put foot inside of his brother's
saloon on Ellis street. The doe jumped
upon the pugilist and was seemingly as
glad to meet him as if he was a jong-lost
master.
The champion became fascinated with
the intelligent animal, and when brother
Harry arrived he was informed that "Jim"
had quickly concluded to own the collie
at any expeuse.
"Well, I do hate to part with that doe,"
said Harry, "but as it is 'Jim' who wants
him I suppose my pet must go. He will
carry good luck and fortune vith him,
and I know that ' Jim' will never own a
more affectionate or bettor dog."
Thecollii is now journeying over the
mountains to Carson, -and as sheepherrt
ers are very numerous in Nevada the
champion pugilist will need to keep a
close watch on his charge or it will depart
for lands unknown when Corbett least ex
pects it. The dog is valued at $2000. It
is a winner of many first prizes on the
bench. â
RAILWAY TO RAMONA.
San Diego Capitalists Organize to Ex
tend a Line From Lakes de
Eastward.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Feb. 16.â George W.
Mariton, George H. liallou, J. E. Fish
burn, M. F. Heller, Simon Levi, Chester
Gunn and M. Sherman met yesterday and
decided to organize immediately the
Santa Maria Valley Railroad Company,
for the purpose of building a line from
Lakeside on the Cayamaca Railroad to
Ramona, twenty miles farther east in
Santa Maria Viilley. The company or
ganizes with $200,000 capital and will
select directors aa soon as $20,000 is sub
scribed. The amount is expected to be
raised largely by popular subscriptions, in
suras ranging from $10 upward. Commit
tees will to-morrow begin soliciting sub
scriptions.
The zentiemen named will probably be
selected as directors, with the exception
of Mr. Gunn, wlio may be retained as as
sistant manager. Captain Sherman will
probably be elected president, and Levi
Chase, who is vice-president of the San
Diego and Cuyamaca road, will be elected
vice-president oi the new corporation.
The road, if built, will penetrate the
largest and richest valley in San Diego
County, and will be on the direct line of a
road to connect with the Southern Pacific
at Dos Palmos, on the desert.
WOMEN LOSE IN NEVADA.
Equal Suffrage Bill Defeated in the
Assembly After Having Passed
the Senate.
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 10.â The bill to
amend the State constitution by striking
out the word "male," or, in other words,
the woman's suffrage bill, was beaten in
the Assembly to-day by a vote of 15 to 15,
a two-thirds majority being needed.
It was discussed at great length at a
special session held last ni~ l Jt and at this
afternoon's session by members and wo
men advocates from all over tbe State.
The bill passed the Senate recently by the
almost unanimous vote.
Assembly bill Z6 passed the House to
day by a vote of 20 to 9. It fixes the li
cense for the sale of cigarettes at $15 a
quarter and makes it a misdemeanor to
sell or give cigarettes to any person under
21 years of age.
Th- law regarding cigarettes, which has
been in force for the past, two years, fixed
the license for their sale at $150 per quar
ter. The new act repeals this law.

President Fieli Will This Morning
Formaly Welcome the Orange
City's Guests.
CLOVERDA.LE, Cal., Feb. 16.â This is
the eve before the citrus fair, and Sono
ma's orange city has on it? holiday garb.
The pavilion looks like a small section of
paradise, -requiring only a few finishing
touches and hundreds of dazzling electric
lights to complete the enchanting picture.
President John Field is the happiest man
in town, and ail because of the splendid
display.
"I see oranges here," said he, "that are
as big as pumpkins, a good many meas
uring over twenty inches in circumfer
ence."
The president, even in his exuberance,
was not stretching the truth to any un
reasonable extent.
The Italian-Swiss colony of Asti, L.
Vasconi superiutendent, has engaged
space and is filling it with an extensive
display of oranges, lemons, olives and
wines. A. Sbarboro, secretary of this
. famous institution, is making an individ
; ual exhibit of citru3 fruits. Los Ajacuges
rancho. owned by H. J. Crocker of San
Francisco, will have a miniature orange
grove at the entrance, constructed by J.
H. ilehring, who, with his wife, is bound
to make this a most effective illustration
of the capabilities of Sonoma's climate for
the growing ot citrus fruits. The Parker
Vineyard Company and Cloverdale Wine
Company will liave large wino exhibits.
The decorating of the pavilion with the
citrus fiesta colors â green, white and yel
low â is finished. The Cloverdaie band is
rehearsing nightly for the music at the
fair. Most of the exhibits will be specially
lighted and beautified with incandescent
lights. To-morrow evening President
Field will make the opening remarks, fol
lowed by the orator of the evening, Judge
A. G. Burnett ot SajUa Rosa, to conclude
with a musical entertainment.

SALEM, Or., Feb. 10.â The rollcall in
the Legislature to-tiay was a great disap
pointment to tiie friends of Senator
Mitchell. This was announced to be the
great daj* which was to carry Mitchell
back into trie ben;;te of the United States.
The House was packed by people gath
ered to witness the event, but a rollcall
showed that only thirty-six members were
present all told, ten short of the number
to constitute a quorum. As there are
only three more days before adjournment,
it is extremely improbable that Mitchell
can do anything mo?e than he has already
done. His defeat may be considered a
certainty. The probability also is that
| there will be no permanent organization
| effected and no Legislature this year.
i The speculation now is whether the Gov
ernor will consent to the calling of an ex
tra session to enact the needed remedial
legislation. The joint assembly will meet
again to-morrow at noon.

CANDIDATES COME
D. A. McDonald Wants to
Bs Harbor Commis
sioner.
Mrs. Sam Fechter Is Seeking
Her Husband on the
Front
She Says Us Played All His Monty ca j
the Wrong Horse anl Vowed to
Drown Himself.
Candidates for the position of Harbor
Commissioner are without number. 'J he
friends of Stewart Menzies assert that he
has the appointment in hi* pocket, while
others -ay that D. A. McDonald has "a
lighting chance." Mr. McDonald is cer
tainly no: letting the grass prow under
his feet. La;t Saturday he started for
Sacramento to interview the Governor,
but his Excellency and Mr. McDonald
parsed each other on the road.
On his arrival at Sacramento McDonald
learned of his mistake and at once posted
back to San Francisco. - lathe meantime
Governor Budd had left for tho capital
r.itd a<:ain the two men passed each other.
McDonald will again go to Sacramento
and in the meantime the employes along
the water front are wondering who will
be the next Harbor Commissioner.
Ou'bide of tne honor and glory, and in
cidentally the salary, t'-e new Commis
sioner will have very little patronage to
bestow for at least six months. Any
changes cow in contemplation are under
the. control of the present board and
owing to the old rule the retiring wharf
ingers and collectors will have their places
rilled by the appointees of Messrs. Colnon,
Chadbourne and Cole. In the meantime,
however, the scramble for the position
goies on.
The steam schooner Coquille River
sailed for Grays Harbor yesterday with a
general car-;o. She will there load lumber
for A. M. Simpson, and after that may go
into the regular Coquille River trade.
Rumor had it yesterday that the vessel
had beon purchased by the Hawaiian
Inter-Island Trading Company, and would
leave here in a few weeks for Honolulu.
â¢The owners of the vessel would not verify
A v -:e story, and Captain Pation saia if there
%?as any truth in the story it was news to
him. In any event, the agents expect to
see the sieamer back here again inside of a
form
The Pacific Mail Company's City of Para
' went on Hunters Point fdrydock yester
day, and will tret a thorough overhauling
before she a'7;iin sails for Panama.
. The Norwegian bark Nordlyset went to
the pew bunkers at Oakland yesterday.
Captain Crockaw of the tug Reliance had
to take her through the two drawbridges,
and had it not been lor the skillful manner
.in which be bandied both vessels tbere
would have been an accident.
The bridge-keeper failed to open the
upner'draw when signaled and the big
snip broached to in :the narrow channel
Luckily the tug lu-:d her and when the
way was clear Nordlyset was towed
without any further trouble to her dock
Had the captain of the Reliance not run
the risk of patting his own vessel on
the mud bank Nordlyset would have
'drifted aghore and probably remained
there for twenty hours." All's well
that ends well, and the Norwegian vessel
is now discharging coal into the Oakland
bunkers.
The captain of the new steamer rfeleno,
built for the Wilder' Steamship Company
of 'Honolulu, has had her first tasie of
Ban Francisco's water front. Just before
.her trial trip the vessel was thoroughly
equipped in every department. All the
ware in the saloon was of silver and had
the flag of the company and also that of
the republic engraved on each fork and
spoon. BBS
Now the chief steward asserts that he is
'Jure California is for free silver. Thieves
/ot in night before last and stole every
article of value in the pantry, and the only
â¢sp'cons sad forks left were those that hap-.
".rened to be in the captain's cabin. A new
supply has been ordered, and in the mean
time the harbor police are looking for the
. thieves. .
A woman accompanied by her fon,
whom she said was Sam Fechter Jr., made
a general tour of tho water front yester
day. According to the story sb.9 told
"NIGHT ON THE WAVES AND THE MOON IS ON HIGH."
Sergeant Mahoney of the harbor police |
her husband is mis-ing. "His name is j
bam Fechter," said she. "and we live on I
OTarrell street. Monday last he went to
the races and lost every cent we had in the
world on a horse he dreamed had won a
race. The colors of the jockeys were very
much alike, and he made a mistake. When
he came home he was despondent, and
yesterday lie left home saying he would
drown himself, i have not seen him
since."
The police have seen no trace of any
man such as the woman described, and
Captain Dunleavy is of the opinion that if
Mr-. Fechter wants to find her husband
she had better go to the r:icetraci%.
Shipping men want to know' where the
British ship Reliance is. She was off the
mouth of the Columbia River a week ago,
and took a pilot. When the northeaster ;
came up the vessel put to sea, and since j
then has not been spoken. The pilot
probably headed the ship out to sea, and
i iha chances are that it may be a week be-
I fore the Reliance is heard from again. .
The Southern Pacific Company's Mack
inaw is playing in hard luck. Some time i
ago she ran on the rocks in Puget Sound, J
and had to be docked for repairs. After j
an overhauling two surveyors pronounced
her seaworthy, and another start for !
San Francisco wa-> made. Strange to say i
she discovered another rock, and had to !
put into Port Townsend, again leaking.
On this occasion she will be thoroughly
overhauled and her coal cargo discharged
before she again attempts to turn Cape
Flattery. HP!?!
The American schooner Aida, now out ]
seventy-seven days from Shanghai for
Port Townsend, is away overdue, and her j
owners are very anxious. They have
asked the Government to send a revenue i
cutter out to search tor the missing vessel,
and the chances are that the Secretary of j
the Treasury will send out one of the I
boats now in port. :
The battleship Orecon got in from Aca
pulco yesterday alter an uneventful run.
The engines were made full use of, and in
consequence no time was lost. All the ,
officers speak in the terms of highest
praise of the warship, and say that a b.'tter i
sea boat never was launched. One of the |
powder-monkeys nearly lost his eyesight j
â  during the run up the coast. During a
| practice drill he got too clo a to the gun
and the powder blew into hi] face. He
i will be laid up for some time, end may
j lose his eyesight altogether. The Oregon i
is anchored in Ricbardsons Bay and will â 
lie there awaiting further orders.
The big pile-driving hammer used by
James McMahon & Sons on l-'ol'om-sireet
; wuarf went overboard yesterday. Wnile
j a slanting pile was being driven,
there was a slip In the rope, a mis
: stroke, and overboard went the hammer.
I A aiver was sent for, but as he reported
the 2000-pound hammer as being fifteen
feet in the mud all attempt at regaining it
was given up until this morning.
The schooner Una came in yesterday
i from Panama without clearance parti rs.
! She iB loaded with cedar log*, and because
| the full purchase money was not paid the
; captain left without permission, as the
| Colombian author tes wanted to hold
I thf* schooner indefinitely. The matter
will probably be settled in the courts.

FROM THE HEAVENS
Professor Tuck Would Free
Cuba by His Torpedo
Rocket.

He Says, Rcbbed Him

of the Antilles and its people from the
tbralldom of Spain, but incidentally blow
the armies of Butcher Weyler into the
place man knoweth not of.
Tuck is his name, and he prefixes it with
the ti.le professor. Profes or J. H. L.
Tuck is an inventor â as versatile an in
ventor as ever drew drawings and talked
i of millions with a nonchalance that makes
the Bradley Martin ball a thinÃ hardly
worth consideration. The professor rc
j side* at 34-9 Nineteenth street, and says
| he has been a resident of San Francisco
for over forty year-.
Inventor Tuck maintains he is not a
crankâ far from it. No man ever talked
more, sanely on subjects of mechanical en
gineering. He is a Reoloeist and raininsj
enpineer by profession. His inventions
include everyt:iinÃ from a death-dealing
submarine torpedo-boat to a sure preven
tive and destroyer of the codlin moth
and the red spider. The torpedo-boat he
claims 10 have invented he ?avs was
named the Peacemaker, and astonished
New York in, 1886 with its wonderful div
iinjÂ» powers.
"I went down to a depth of ninety-six
feet in New York harbor in 1886," said
Professor Tuck yesterday, "and attached
two torpedoes to the bottom of a ship.
Tne men of "Wall street immediately saw
the uÂ«efulne-s of ray invention andfroze
me out. It was a stcck company, aud
they bought un all the sock, thus doing
me out of $1 5,000.000 or $20,000,000. That
was the end of my aspiration*. They took
'he Peacemaker and thought to utilize it
to tlieir own advantage, but they could
find no one who would dare to descend in
it, and so !o-iiay the boat is lying ia:e on
one of the wharves in New York."
Just now ProieÂ«sor Tuck is devoting his
attention to freeing the Cubans from the
Casiiiian yoke. This is th? problem of his
life. He has studied, so he says, the cam
paign Gomez anil hi? patriots have been
carrying on against Weyler, and be be
lieves he has invented "something" that
will settle the problem in Cuba once and
for all, providing he can only reach tbe
ear of Senor Eitrada Palmi, the leader <â¢.'
the Cuban Junta in New York. The pat
arc- Dairying on a suerilla form of
warfare, and consequently not ab.e to
transport heavy artillerr, or even ordinary
li Id guns in th"!r ranid movements.
Professor Tack would, in place of heavy
ball and Â»bell, substitute what he calls a
"torpedo rocket." The plan of the in
vention :s similar to the ordinary sky
rocket, except that in place of the vari
colored chemicals that go to light the
lieaveu- on gala niglit3, be would substi
tute aj the contents of the rocket dyna
mite or fulminate ol mprcury.
"My rocket would be light," said Pro-
feasor Tuck; '"so lignt that each Cuban
soldier could carry at least a tiozen of
ttiem on h.s back without seriously inter
fering witli bis tie daccourtermeats. Each
rocket would be capable of traveling a
ml;e, and could be so arranged as to be
exploded eiti er by timefuse or by concus
sion. Immediately upon exploding it
wou:d destroy every vestige of animal life
I within a hundred feet of it. One hundred
! of these rockets discharged into an army,
either in motion Â«r la rest, would anni
hilate it. Had Gomez these rockets it
would have been impossib:e for WeyJer's
armies to exist at all. They wouM be de
stroyed from ambush as they approached.
"I have already brought the matter to
Senor Pilnia through the instrumentality
of a friend of mine in New York. I know
Pjlma is anxious to utilize my invention,
providins the rocKets can be made cheaply
and in quantities. This difficulty I have
overcome."
Professor Tuck says he will leave for
New York in a few days to submit his in
vention to Palma personally.

Sad Death of the Wife of Jimes
CaDavan, the Well-Known
Stevedore.
Mrs. Kate Canavan, while demented
lrom the effects of an operation, com
mitted suicide by jumping into the bay
from Hathaway's wharf early yesterday
morning.
Airs. Canavan was the wife of James
Caravan, the well-known stevedore, and
lived with her husband and children at
3456 Beale street. Fearing that she would
injure herself, her husband has had some
one watch her for several days past, but
Mrs. Canavan slipped away and ended her
life.
About 4 o'clock Harry Strong, the night
watchman Â°Â» the dock, heard a heavy
splash, and running to the e"dpe of the
deck saw M'?- Canavan's almost nude
body floating away. He hurried to get a
boat, but before he could return with it
the unfortunate woman h.td disappeared.
The greater portion of her clothing was
found on the wharf.
About 7 o'clock one of the searchers for
the body â Jack McArdle, a boatman
found it on the b-ach under Harrison
street wharf, wh*ro it had bee.i carried by
the tide.
The deceased was 43 years of age and a
native of Ireland.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., /eb. 16.â The lat
est project at the famous mining camp of
Randsburg and its newer neighbor, Jo
hannesburg, is in the line of evangelical
labors, for which there is said to be "emi
nent domain." Evangelist Nagle of the
Episcopal Church has been preaching at
various times in an improvised skating
rink at R.indsburg. He has had lart;e
numbers of rough but honest miners to
hear his sermons and has been given sub
stantial encouragement in his chosen
work.
Parson Nag'e has now decided to estab
lish churches in both Randsburg ana Jo
hannesburg, having been given a lot and
other substantial inducements in Johan
nesburg, with similar help in Randsburg.
The two towns are so near together that
he can easily work in both, and it may
be truthfully said that both places afford
a wide field for evangelical work.
A change has taken place in the town
stte management at Johanne9bug. E.19
--ton, Eidridge & Co. of San Francisco will
now have entire charge and control of the
townsite and everything connected with
it. George Easton was there yesterday
and completed all arrangements, Jeaviug
for San Francisco this forenoon. He ex
pects to return on Thursday.
The teie s raph line readied Johannes
burg last evening from Kramer, on the
Atlantic and Pacific RaiJrocd, and the
first telegraphic message ever sent from
that desert country was dispatched by Mr.
Pratt, secretary of the company. This
line will be continued into Randsburg in
a day or two.
LOS ANGELES AFFRAY.
Gambler O'Keefe Shoois Another of the
Profession and Wounds a
Bystander.
LOS ANGELES, Cai. , Feb. 16.â A gang
of "tin-horn" camblers and '"sure-tning"
men, Including Bob and Henry Anderson,
brothers, and William O' Keefe, alias Bill
Knight, alias Charley Keitb, got into a
row in the Elite saloon, on South Spring
street, about 7 o'clock this evening, and
O'Keefe got much tha worst of tne en
counter at the hands of Bob Anderson.
Angered by his defeat and bearing an
old grudge against Anderson. O'Keefe
quit the saloon, only to return in a few
minutes with a revolver i.. his hand. Bod
Anderson was leaning asains' the bar and
did not observe the approach of O'Keefe.
Harry Anderson saw tne enraged man
approaching his brother and stepped in
front of therevolver- bearer just in time to
slop with his left side a ball intended for
his brother.
The bullet struck a rib and passed around
to a noint near the spinal column.
O'Keefe tired again in the direction of
Bob Anderson, but instead of hitting his
foe he wounded a bystander in the right
groin. Thi3 unfortunate individual proved
to be an old German pickle peddler named
Dumien Gebhardt.
After this O'Keefe handed his revolver
to an acquaintance, walked briskly out of
the saloon and went to his stopping place
on TweJfth street, near Un.on avenue.
There he was found by Detective Steele
soon afterward. Steele brought the hhooter
to the station nnd locked him up. His
face and loft eye snowed signs of rough |
treatment and a finger had been crushed
in the melee.
It is said O'Keefe has acted as "capper"
fir this snloon for some time. Warren
King owned the Elite until a few weeks
apo. He had some differences with O'Keefe
recently and sold the p!aco to Anderson
and Thomas of the Eintracht ssloon on
North Spring ttreet. Ttie Elite bns !on^
borne a hard name, many complaints
reaching the police station respecting
gambling gam -s in the place.
O'Keefe. or Charley Keitb, as he is
known about town, is not unknown to the
poli c officers. Ho belongs to a gang of
confidence men. He was a-ked for his
side of the story shortly after his arrest,
but declined to make any statement for
publication, saying that he had been ad
vised to say nothing. The hospual sur
geons say that the two wounded men will
probably recover, Anderson's wound being
t!ie least serious.
PERRY S. CORE.
Until a short time ago Mr. Perry S. Corl was In
rerfect health. He ate and slept moderately, but
finely. Life was a pleasure to htm. (f a sudden
he developed a peculiar caie of dyspepsia. It was
an acute one. Many doctors were called in anJ
trieJ to relieve ttie patient. The good was only
temporary, and still 31 r. Corl suffered. Alarmed
at his conUtlou. his friends advised him to use
Joy 's Vegetable sarsapurllla.
P. s. Corl did use the medicine, and be began in
a single day to show signs of rapid recovery.
Twenty-four bourj after he began using Joy's
Vegetable Sanaparilla the gases in his stomach
began to subside, He cou d take small quantities
of frod, and he slept much better. He writes of
his own accord. He says :
The Ki>win W. Joy Company, 289 Stevenson

now it Is alt over. I can recall ho \ the gases bad
dUtended my stomach out of all proportion. 1

STATE HIGHWAYS.
While everybody in the State desires to vee the beginning of the work of road im
provement, it is questionable whether the plan proposed to achieve that result coder
the â¢apervisioa of a board of State co : . oners will be acceptable to any considers.
ble number of the people. The more the question of Â£tatÂ« highways under State
control is di;cus>e4 the more weighty appear the objections to It. Home of these are
j ter-ely staled in an interview with Supervisor Ayer of Santa Clara County which we
j publish this morning. It seemn clear that the proposed measure would result in im
posing :-'3tie burden: upon many sections of tbe State and would result in com*
paratively little good to any.
One effect of establishing a series of State nigh ways to be maintained by State taxa
tion voold be the lapoiftitMi of taxes upon all parti of the State, while the proposed
highways would benefit only t&e comparatively small section through which they ran.
Residents of cities, who now pay a large proportion of taxes to the Btate, would be
compeMfd to pay their pro rata of the expense of maintaining these highways,
although the highways would be distant from them and of no benefit to their people
or their traffic.
Not on v would the cities be unjustly taxed for the maintenance of benefits In
j which they would not share, but the more progressive counties of tbe State which
have now provided themselves with good highways wou'd be compelled to pay for
constructing roads in other counties where the people have either oeen negligent and
parsimonious in regard to road construction or else have elected to the office of Super
visor men who are either incapable of attending to their duties or were wasteful of
public money. It is not fair that counties which have done good work for themselves
ebouM be compelled by tbe State to pay for the negligence of counties which have
hitherto left their highways unimproved.
In tliii, as in all other matters where local eelf-gov?rnraent is possible, each eov
won is Lest. The people of a coanty who ore to derive benefit from the high
' ways within its borders are the people who should uay for them, and if they refuse to
do it the penally of bad roads falls where it belongs, Santa Clara County has
demonsirate'J that under the present law it is possible to construct and maintain
pood roads without State .-.:â !. Her Supervisors lave not only kept highways as good
as any in Hie Union throughout the valley sections of the county, but through the
rolling hills and rugged mountains to the east end west. The people of Santa Clara,
tnerefore, would have nothing to gain by the proposed system of State highways, but
much to 10-e. Inasmuch ns they would not receive from the State a snra sufficient to
maintain their highways in their present excellent condition, and yet would have to
! pay taxes to help maintain State highways in other localities.
| hunta Clara is not the only ronnty la the State that would b<Â» Injured by thÂ« adop
tion of the proposed system of State highways supported by State taxation. There
are others which have expended lar/e sums of money in the construction of public
roads and are now reaping the benefit of the expenditure. Ii is a sufficient burden
upon them to maintain their own highways. The interests of these counties are
entitled to consideration as much as the interests of counties where the people have
| done little or nothing for themselves, and where they have gone on year after year
content with bad roads or indifferent to good ones.
The people of Han Francisco and of other cities in the State have strong reasons
I lor opposing thÂ« proposed rnea-ure. Tbe cities pay approximately two-thirds of the
| State taxes, and would, of course, have to pay about two-thirds of the amount ex
j pended for the State highways. This would be in addition to the sum which they
would have to levy for themielves to maintain their streets. It haroly needs argu
| ment to show the unfairness of such a proposition. All the cities of California are
| young and rapidly growing. There is an Incessant demand upon them for money to
rcpave old streets and open new ones. The burden of taxation upon City residents
for street work is already as heavy as they can bear, and they ou^ht not to be called
upon to pay for rural highways as welL
Taking all things into consideration the proposed State highway system is
decidedly unadvisable. It can have no other effect than that of taxing one man for
the benefit of another, laying burdens upon cities for the welfare of counties and
upon enterprising communities for those that have been less progressive and lea
thrifty. Road improvements we must have, but the surest and best way to attain
them is by leaving the work to counties themselves and imposing upon the people the
responsibility as well as the privileges of local self-eovernment.
A SUCCESSFUL fcXHiSIT.
The home products exhibit recently held
at Ix>s Angeles may be fairly accounted to
hare, been a *ucceÂ«aful one in every re-
Hpect. Tijis is made evident by the fact
that tho criticism which follows the ex
hibit has been as favorable as were the
notices given it by the press during its
continuance.
All the Los Angeles papers in Humming
up the remits of the Mbit speak as cor
dially of the display ana of the manage
ment as they did during the time when it
was running and when their reports may
be considered to have been to a large ex
tent colored by a desire to praise it in
order to attract visitor*). The judgm-nt
pronounced since the close of the exhibit
amply confirms all the favorable things
haul about it while it was itill a civic fes
tival and a matter of municipal pride.
One feature of the later criticisms and
comments that deserves notice Is the j
warm praise given to the manager of the |
exhibit, Mr. Charles de Gartno Gray. i
â  Thia gentleman seems to have won "gold- â 
en opinions from all sorts of people." !
The directors of the exhibit, the press ana
the exhibitors all combine in tiring bin
credit for the greater portion of the suc
cess attained and in expressing a warm
end high appreciation of his services.
Mr. Gray is evidently one of those men
who are fitted both by talonts and train
ing for the conduct of Â«uch complex
affairs as & great exposition. 6ucce>gful
managers of such enterprises are few. In
the very nature of things at all exposi
tion* there are antagonism^ between the
director* and the exhibitors and also be
tween one exhibitor and another. Every
man who has a display to make desires
the largest space arid the raosl favorable
location. To harmonize the conflicting
claims which arise out of these desires !
requires something more than ordinary
tact, and he Is a very good manager In- j
deed who succeeds in doing It.
Wo took occasion daring tnecontinn- j
ance of the exhibit to congratulate Lot |
Angeles on th - splendid display made, as
reported by our correspondent in that city. |
We have now occasion to congratulate her j
again on its successful conclusion. It is
no slight thing to have held an import
ant exhibit of this kind and brought it to
an end without developing causes of com- ;
plaint which lead to mutual recrimina- ]
tions.
We are all well aware that the Los
Angeles spirit in such as to prompt every
Los Angeles man to praUe and commend
everything done by his city or in his city
no matter what his individual feeling may j
be. In this case, however, the warmth of
the general praise gives evidence of a
pen DIM sincerity. It Is clear that Mr.
de Garmo Gray furnished Los Angeles
with exactly the leadership needed to
awaken her ever responsivo public spirit
and prompt it to the right action in tbe
right way. _______________

According to a correspondent of the
Chicago Inter Ocean railroad companies
which have been holding back purchase*
of rails for three or four years are now
taking ad van of the enormous slash in

If some of these companies will now head

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1897.
THE ARBiTR'TION TREATY.
The vote taken upon the resolution of
Senator Morcan declaring the CJayion
-- wer treaty abrogated may be consid
ered a tear vote on the arbitration treaty,
since the ol ject oi Morgan's resolution
was not so much to discuss the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty as to postpone considera
tion Of the treaty of arbitration which was
being Dressed by the administration
forces. The vote was a close one, as the
Morgan resolution prevailed by a major
ity of only 82 to Si. It was sufficient for
the purpose, however, and the considera
tion of the arbitration treaty wen lover for
the time.
Unless something unforeseen occurs, it
is hardly likely after this that any
earnest attempt will be made by
the friends of the administration
to bring the arbitration treaty to
a vote at this tension. It will take two
thirds of the Senators to ratify it, and it
aeems impossible to obtain these at the
present time no matter how tLe treaty
may be amended.
When the subject was fir*t broached and
the treaty first announced to tho people, it
was received with a considerable degree of
popular favor. As time has passed, how
ever, and fuller consideration was given,
this favor has diminished, until it now
no longer probable that the original treaty
stands any chance whatever of acceptance.
Even in it- amended form its pai-.sape is
still doubtful, and the advocates of it Mem
to understand this and are no longer eager
to force the vote.
One point made by Senator Morgan has
produced a strong impression on Senators
of all parties and all shades of opinion.
This is the aeaertion that the ratification
of a standing compact of arbitration
would for the period of Its operation sus
pend the exercise of the Senate's consti
tutional functions as a part of the treaty
making power. If i he proposed arbitra
tion agreement is adopted by this coun
try the President would have sole juris
diction over all questions to be submitted
to arbitration under the convention, and
could resort to it at all times without tbe
an vice or consent of tne Senate.
This objection has weight even with
those Henators who hold that the pro
pos d treaty does not seriously affect any
of the rights of this country. It is as
valid against the treaty as amended as
against that which was first proposed.
Mr. Cleveland has given the Senate a
warning of the extent to which a Presi
dent can co In ignoring the Senate, and it
Is not likely that any future President
will be intrusted with more power than
ha* been Invested in his office by the con
stitution itnÂ»lf.
RAILROAL/ lUiLD.NG.
The popular expectation tbat this is to
be a year remarkable for the extent of its
railroad building receives confirmation
from all sources. Reports of new lines
projected haye been followed by reports
of laree orders lor steel rails and by appli
cation to the various Legislatures of the
Union for auch amendments to the laws
as are needed to make secure the capital
invented in the proposed new enterprises.
One of the most significant events of the
day confirming the reports of increased
railroad building soon to be undertaken
Is the collapse of the great steel-rail
trust. It seems that orders for rails to
such large amounts were placed on the
market thai the mills which formed the
tros were unable to resist the temptation
to break away. The well-informed corre
spondent ol the Chicago Inter Ocean says:
"Railroad companies which have been
holding back purchases of rails for three
or four years are now taking advantage of
the enormous slash in rates, and this
year's railroad bull ling ia expected to
break the record of 1892."
Additional confirmation that the year
is to be a great one for railway building is
found in the appearance at Rucramento of
representatives of the Atchison, Topeka
and Kama FÂ« Railroad, seeking to secure
certain legislation that will enable thai
road to extend its lines in this State. The
legislation < esired by the Santa Ye will
be beneficial not only to that road but to
the Kmi F rancisco ana Sau Joaquin Val
lojr road, and the fact that it has Been
applied for gives credit to the general ex
pectation that toe Valley road will sooner
or la'er be connected with Â«he Eanta Fe
system and thus form an overland com
petitive route.
It is, ol course, possible tbat tbe realiza
tion of the year will not equal popular
expectation. It sull take a loug time U,t
thÂ« country to recover Jrom the depres
sion whtch it has undergone during tbe
pest four years. It seems evident, how
ever, from the reports wnich come to us
tbat there is to be a considerable revival
of railroad building, even if it does not
talld tbe prophecy of tbe Inter OwMM i
correspondent and break tbe record of 18& J. I
The most cheering feature to California ;
in tbe situation is the fact tbat many of \
these railway enterprises, aad by far the j
most important of tnem as reported, are
tr.e proposed extensions of lines to the j
West, and particularly to this State. We
seem to be on the verge of a *ett!emenl of
the long controversy between the people
and the Southern Pacific Railroad by
breaking ud the monopoly of that com
pany and the establishment of a competi
tive transcontinental line. The outlook
is so bright tbat it may easily lead many
POOpta to be over sanguine, but if due re
gard is raid to ali the difficulties in the
way it will t.till be found that there is
abundant reason for the expectation that
the year will be a notable one for railroad
building throughout tbe Union, and that j
California wi l receive her due share of it.

Letters From the People.
A GRAND PROJECT.
The Propound Highway front Ban
JFraneiteo Through, the *>anta
Clara Valley
To the Editor of the San Francitco Callâ Sir:
In the Mennia. report of the Slate Bureau of
Highways, rtcni y is?uel. 1 find the follow
ing among the plans suggested lor the con
struction ot highways by the State:
Thirdâ A highway commencing at the City and
County of Man I rancifcco and extending tuence
noutlK-astPrly on the nest grades a d alUninetus
through the counllei of Mm Ma;eo, sarim Clara
.-an Ilmito, Monterey, Kan Lots Obispo, Ventura
and Los Angeles to the city of Los Angeles.
Tnis recommendation evidently contem
plates the con unction of a new road leading
ironi San FrancUco southward through the
Kanta Clara Valley to its terminus, as the
road that now runs from S&u Francisco t â  hart
Jose cannot be much improved or widened
without moving houses and fences and cutting
down trees, which would cost more than
building a new road.
In addition to this the present road is hardly
sufficient for the amount of travel over it.
The construction of a boulevard from Ban
Francisco to San Jose has been agitated for
several years, but It is probable that San Kriiu
clÂ«co will be called upon to defray a consider
able share of the expense of the building of
the proposed Slate roads. It is but Just that it
should desire some immediate advantages
from them. It requires no stretch of the Im
agination to understand the great benefits that
Ban Francisco would secure from such a high
way or boulevard, particularly if it should be
of sufficient width to permit of the layin* of
rails on one tide of It for an electric road with
out interfering with the travel over it.
The footnill region of the Santa Clara Valley
cannot be surpassed for climate and healthful
ness. It is well supplied wttn good water, has
excellent drainage, and has magnificent views.
It is sheltered irom the prevailing western
winds and It almost entirely free from fogs,
yet with all these natural advantages and at
traction* it i* very thinly populated, Mmply
because the cost ol tranoportation to and from
San Francisco is too expensive and the means
of travel not frequent enough. The territory
south of San Francisco is its natural outlet.
The City is destined, at no distant day, to
grow rapidly in that direction. If it should
continue to grow Â«4 nsl Id the next fifty years
as It has in the pact fifty yeaÂ», it Is more than
X robabie it.ii it will include within its limit*
tisÂ« cities of Iledwood ai.d km Mateo. Tee
construction of t.ie proposed highway or
boulevard would r.MÂ»t*riaLy aid acl hasten
tola mucb-deÂ«ired object.
If the xneexure now before the State LÂ»-zi>!t-
tnre for the construction of a tarsias of elf h
wayi should t* patted and become a law, it
will b* the s-reatest boon conferred on the
Maid by any Legltlaicre since the State was
admitted to the Union. CHAÂ£ZJE* Uakx:>B.

AROUNU THE CORRIDOR!
"It la astonishing bow thing* change in and
about many of the raining townt of the Rocky
Mountains and Sierra Nevada ranges," said
C. W. Bowles at the Grand Hotel yesterday.
! "I iappoÂ»e these changes are equally char-
I acteristic of other mining regions. A few
I yean ago, when I wu at that age when life
seemed one continual round of adventure and
romance, I wai proprietor of a weekly paper
on almost thÂ« very crest of the Rocky Monn
tains.
"it wu during the days when the silver ex
citement ran high, and when sliver carbon
ates were being struck right and left. The
camp where I was located was a; an altitude
of almost two miles above the sea. The great
rivers of the continent bad their sources
there. Tne Arkansas, the Platte and the re
motest affluent of the Colorado started from
the snows in these mountains and within but
a short distance of each other.
"The Colorado flowed far west to the Gulf of
California and mingled it* waters with the
Pacific, and the Plane and the Ar
kansas trending eastward and south
ward for tnonsands of miles and
blending with other streams at last reached
the Gulf of Mexico. It was said that at one
point tne sources of tnese rivers were bo c'.cs;
that you could take a nautilus shell and ac
cording as you dropped it to your right or
your left it would reach the Atlantic or the
Pacific.
"In these lofty heights, where the air was
pure ozone, we made a booming little mining
town. There were deep forests of pine and
other woods about there. These fringing the
lower portions of the great mountains gave
them a singular beauty.
"None of us who lived there in those romantic
times had any Idea what these woods did for
us. I have recently been there again and 1
found that the charcoal-burner and the man
in search of mine timber; bad cut off every
bit o! this forest, even down to the little trees.
The great mountains were bare and hostly.
"I had returned with some tremors of the
hear:, for those were happy days, but when I
saw the bare mountains and the camp, which
had become stone dead, I had no qualms. It
was a satisfaction that I should live there no
more.
"I notice that in many of the camps of the
Sierras the same thing has happened. These
trees should be protected from at least use
less waste. Cut from the rocky sides of the
mountains, where they are needed to hold
the snow and preserve the sources of the
water, they will not grow again la a hundred
years." â  '

"H-ruic men, my deed was nobly done!
America and liberty are raised
To one high pom of universal fame:
No deed forgotten nor a name uDp raised
That turned the prile of tyranny to shame,
As Lincoln's hand released a race of slaves
So Washington ties roved tbe rule of kings,
And heroes marched, unfearf ul, to their graves
Thai freedom might ascend on equal wings.
And yon, O son* whose heritage is stained
With voluntary blood that twice was poured
An offering to Freedom, you have gained
A land where every ma i 's his own lord:
Where kings rule r.oi, nor men. like slaves, obey.
What wonder then the pair otic heart

No home is left, no life may go unharmed
That does not bjw to Spain's remorseless will.

Upon their hopes of liberty and peace.
Americans! their lives are in your hands.
A word from you will bid the conflict cease,
For even Spain will hearken your commands.
Use evear art of argument to show
To warring Spain bow, erring la her cause,
Sh? brings upon herself unending woe,
Nor ever courts a watching world's applause.
"Demist, O bloody >pain! Forego your pride.
If mastery has aught to win the praise
Of other nations, think you they will hide

Or, falling thus, say, "Land of ancient fame.
In wars 00 land and sea! 'la but disgrace
To thus belittle such a valiant name
By warring with asma 1 and helpless race.''
And If the pride of power and of birth
Have dwindled In the growing lust of gold,
Say, "Spain, why rob, when all this fruitful earth
To honest labor will its store unfold?"
And If from argument she -.urns her ear,
Let pleading go an I huoder your command :
"O ruthless Sjaln, our ultimatum bear! .
Retail at once your devastating band,
Or ships and guns and men In freedom born
Will cross the narrow neck of sea and give
The Cuban- aid." And Spain shall fall, and scorn
Shall mar* her name, while liberty shall live.

San Franclsc", Feb. 15. 1897.
EXAMINER AND WATER RATES.
Pan Francisco Journal nf Commerce.
It is unfortunate for San Francisco that it
has a newspaper of the Examiner stamp.
When It fails to carry a point by legitimate
methods it resorts to blackmail and the prac
tice of the highwayman. It hus been ou the
payro.l of corporations for large amounts.
Spring Valley is evidently an exception, for
tho daily boodle r has declined to discuss the
affairs of the water corporation with that fair
ness which invariably carries conviction in
public mind. Therefore it is, we repeat, un
fortunate for San Francisco when investments
in pub ic securities are continually assailed by
the Examiner because, forsooth, a large pro
portion of the profits tire not turned over to it.
The Supervisors are asked to fix the water
rates so as not to yield a rate ol dividend to the
stockholders larfier than 3 or 4 per cent, and
the Examiner Impudently makes the bold
stuteini-nt that unless they conform to Its re
qu' st they are to consider themselve3 thieves
and the hirelings of the water company. But
the Superv sors are familiar with tho unscru
pulous ways of the monarch of boodlers, and
they will, therefore, not be intimidated. It
perchance they sh >uid be, the inevitable would
followâ namely, that investments in public
utilities here would henceforth be considered
unsafe and unprofitable.
The question is whether or not 4 per cent is
enouÃQ. According to the Examiner it is
ample. If this rule is established then other
securities, such as gas, street railroad and
many other securities, must come under the
operation of the same rule. Are investors,
therefore, likely to put their capital Into secu
rities of this nature which, it must be ad
mitted, are more or less risky? The savings
banks are paying rates on deposits similar to
those being agitated by the Examiner for the
water company's shareholders and tbe deposi
tors can uraw money when needed, whereas
on the other hand an investment in the stocks
of the water and other companies is subject to
fluctuations and cannot always be realized
upon. The duty of the Supervisors is plain ;
they should deal with the water company
fairly and without prejudice. The stock
holders of the corporation are composed of
many of our most worthy caitens and their
interests sbou d be considered as of greater
importance in this community' than the cry
of a self-convicted boodler, which not long ago
was on the payroll of the Southern Pacific
Company to the tune of $1000 a month.
CONVICT LABOR
WAS CONDEMNED
Manufacturers Opposed to
Power Machinery
in Prisons.
Police Judges Scored for Not
Enforcing the Pare
Food Law.
A Statement That the Ftar cf Losing
Votes Prevents Them From Do
iog Th.ir Daly.
A special meetinjr of no small im
portance was held by the directors of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion yesterday. The principal subject
discussed was a resol'Jtoa previously of
fered by Director Kerr. In substance it
was that the Legislature be requested to
pass a bill providing lor the abolishment
of all power machinery in tho State
prisons and that after December 31, 1897,
the convicts be compelled to perform their
labor by hand, unaided by machinery.
This resolution had been referred to the
legislative committee of thÂ« association,
and yesterday two reports were made by
the committee. The majority report was
that at this time the association should
not take up this matter. The minority,
s gned by Mr. Kerr, favored the adoption
of me resolution as presented.
Mr. Kerr delivered an eloquent address
in support of his position. He said that
efforts are being made to have the State
purchase more machinery, especially for
me rock-crushing project at Folsom.
There is airealy a large sum of money
tied up in prison machinery in this State,
particularly at the San Quentin prison.
Ttie prison directors are making every
effort to keep even on tne expenses, but
ibis is impossible, when all the outlay
necessary to maintain surh an institution
is taken into consideration. In order to
make a snowing tne manufacture of any
class of articles by convicts b comes a
commercial feature and competition with
free labor follows and the latter is made to
suffer. Mr. Kerr stated that when Chi
cago was in the height of her prosperity
the State-prison convicts were engaged in
the cooperage line and ran all the outside
coopers out of business. In other places
the wooden and willow ware business was
ruined by convicts. New York has
i.bandoned power machinery In its orisons
and the men are kept on hand labor only.
While the farmers are benefited by the
manufacture of jute grain bags, they
eventually lose ali in the hi<tn shipping
rates.
Mr. Kerr spokÂ» of the idle 600 idle
workingmen in this City who are endeav
oring to secure aid from the officials, and !
said ihat this is a strange time for Warden j
Aull to lobby in the Leg siature for more ;
machinery, so that still more free men
â¢bonld be made idle in order that he I
mig t find work for bis jailbird?. Again j
speaking of the jutemiil, Mr. KÂ»rr stated '
that the director's report for 1895 showed j
that the mill runs behind $I:J.uX) a year, i
He urged that the association go on record
as opposing power machinery in ihe Cali
fornia State prisons.
Director Allen agreed with Mr. Kerr so
far as the rock-crushing machinery is con
cerned, but he was opposed to interfering '
with the jute plant in the other prison.
Besides it was too late to do anything ;
with this Legislature. Upon the recom- j
mendaiion of Director Keller that the date
Of abolishing power machinery in the
prisons be changed from December 31,
1897. to December 31, IS9S." Mr. Kerr's
resolution was adopted.
The next subject discussed was intro
duced by President Sonntag, who stated
that the pure-iood ordinance is sadly dis
! regarded. The Heath Department officers
' arr-.-st offender?, but tne Police Judges
dismiss tne cases for fear that at the next
election they will lose tbe votes o - all wno
are prosecuted and convicted. He sug
gested that a conference be he.d with the
Police Judees to see if the law can be in
forced. If not, tben it wonld be weil to j
see .f chere is any Jaw by which the Police
Judges can be reached.
Director Jacobs stated that there had
been twenty-three arrests in ten days and
all had been clear violations of the law,
yet there were twenty acquittals and but
three convictions, and Judge Campbell
was the only one who had the courage to
impose heavy tines. The Judges divided
ud the cases because they were fearful of
losine votes if the whole oaten fell to one
court. Mr. Jacobs ssid that a report by
Msjor McKinley of Ohio showed that in
1895 ' he impure-food bu-ines* amounted
to $27,000 a day and $1,800,000,000 a year.
D rector Allen of the Pure-food Com
mittee of the Council of Associated Indus
tries stated that the committee had ap
pointed an attorney to drafi a legislative
bill making the handling of adulterated
food a felony instead of a misdemeanor.
The bili prepared provides for the first of
fense a fine of not less than $25 nor more
than $1000; for the second offence not less
than $50 nor more than $200, or impri-on
ment in the County Jail for six months ;
for the third and nil suhÂ«equiÂ»nt offenses
a fine not less than $500 nor more than
$100 and imprisonment in trie State prison
not less than one nor more than five
years.
A committee consisting of Directors
Sbarboro, Jacobs and McLnughtin was
appointed to call upon the Police Judges
with a view of having the pure-food ordi
nance enforced. If this conference does
not result satisfactorily the asscciati Â«n
will lay the matter before the Grand
Jury.
President Sonntag called attention to
the fact that the annual meeting and
election of directors of the associaiion will
be held on March -i. Therefore he ap
poinied as a committee to make arrange
ments for that meeting D. rectors Mead,
Keller and KÂ»rr.

STOCKS THAT
TOOK WINGS
In Their Flight They In
volve C. P. Harris, a
Stock-Broker.
Charged With Selling Stccks,
Keeping the Proceeds, and
Levying Assessments.
He Failed When the Market Took a
Rise and Owners Wanted
to R Iza
The Grand Jury yesterdny returned an
indictment aeainst C. P. Harris, late a
stock-broker, upon a charge of embezzle
ment.
The indictment was found upon in
formation furnished by Mrs. M. H. Bark
ley of 1312?^ Ellis street. Mrs. Barkley
is a woman of means and has a decided
penchant for speculating in stociss. She
did business in a great measure through
Harris. Harris failed on the 7th of May
last year, during a decided upward flurry
of the stock market. Mrs. Barkley says
he char-ed his suspension to the fact that
his patrons would not keeptheir margins.
She says she had the utmost confidence in
his integrity, and when he declared that
she owed him, according to his books,
$11,426 on unpaid assessments, interest,
commissions ana other charges incident
to trading in stocks, she believed him ana
felt herself partly responsible for his finan
cial undoing.
She talked about the matter a good dea 1 ,
expressing her sympathy for Harris, and
expressed the intention of paying him
$10,G0u. This came to the ears of some
who ciaime<l to know things about Harris
and they advised her to have Mr. Harris'
books exper'ed.
She engag d Frank Shay, attorney, to
iook into me matter and in a short iim j ,
to her amazement, she learned that Har
ris really owed her something like $2500.
It was discovered, according to Shay
and Mrs. Barkley. wno were both before
the jutors yesterday, that Harris had for
years b-en levying interest and assess
ments upon Mrs. Barkiey lor stocks tnat
he had long before sold. Mrs. Barkley, as
long aeo as May, 1592, acting for George
O. Davis, had deposited with Harris cer
iain valuabie stocks, among them Ophir,
Best & Belcher and Con. Virginia, of the
total value at that time of $9845. The
stocks belonged to Mr. Davis. Mrs. Bark
ley Lad become acquainted with Harris
throueh calling at his office to visit a
friend there. Harris a^Ked her to deposit
the stocks with !iim and he would find
occasion to do Mr. Davis many a good
turn through them. She finally did as he
wished.
Mrs. Barkley believed the stocks to be
still in liirns' possession, as he had
called upon her repeatedly for asscss
ruenis on them, and she had "trotted in"
with cash sums to the amount of $I*oo to
meet them, together witti interest on
back payments compounded at 1 per cent
a month.
The fact was, aÂ« disclosed by an inspec
tion of Harris' books, that he had sold
the stocks on the very day that she placed
tti-ni in his hands. \Vnen he failed he
claimed to have neither stocts of any
kind or money. Mrs. Barkley says that a
(treat number of his patrons suffered from
l.ke treatment, many of them losing all
they possessed. His failure â or the con
fusion of his insolvency â was brought
about, she says, by the rise in the stock
market that filled his ollice with people
directing him to sell their stock. As he
had no stocks to sell â having already sold
them âhe was compelled to close his
doors.
NOW THE BAR STEPS IN.
Another Banquet for Judge
McKenna Saturday
Night.
Mrs. McK-nna Decides Not to Attend
the Inaugural Ceremcnirs at
Wasbiogton.
Merrily as a wedding bell goes on the
preparation for the banquet to Judge Mc-
Kenna. The work began only the day
before yesterday, but already a deluge of
favorable responses to invitations have
poured into the headquarters of the com
mittee at the Palace Hotel.
It augurs well now that the court will
be one of the roost successful ever given
in San Francisco. An unusually laree
assemblage of Federal, State and munici
pal officials of note and prominent resi
dents from all over the State will be at
the banquet. The army aud navy will
also ue largely represented.
No estimate as to the number that will
be present can be made until all the re
turns are in, but the committee state that,
while they fully realize the number of
Judge McKenna's friemls to be legion, so
spontaneous a response to the invitations
already issued was hardly to be looked for.
The commit cc is being assisted in its
work by a corps ofÂ» young ladies, and all
arrangements will probably be completed
to-day.
More honors to Judge McK-nna are al*o
to be accorded by his brethren of the legal
profession. About sixty members of the
Bar Association have decided to tender
him a banquet next Saturday nik'ht.
Judge McKenna's wife will not go to
Washington for the inaugural ceremonies.
Though urged to do so by her many
friends in that city she feels that she can
not leave this City before the Ist of July.
Among the affairs which so imperatively
demand her presence here are the ar
rangements for the marriage of her eldest
daughter to Peter Donahue Martin.
The date of the marriage has not yet
been set, but it will probably be celebrated
before the McKenna iiome in this City is
broken up. Later on, thÂ« Judge hiraselt
will choose a house in Washington, and
his wife will act as chief overseer in ship
ping the household eftects there.
A MYSTEBIOUS DEATH-
W. H. Brenner Found Unconscious and
Uies in the *-ecelving Hospital.
William H. Brenner, 54 years of age, up
to a few days ago a porter in Beckniann's
saloon, Bush street and Belden dace, was
found unconscious and bleeding Monday
evening at the corner of Sutter and Leav
enworth streets. He wib removed to the
Receiving Hosi ital, anÂ»J yesterday morn
ing he succumbed to his injuries.
The old man had been drinking heavily
when last seen alive, and it is believed
that he received bis injuries by falling
from or being knocked down by a street
car. The deceased resided with his
brother at 127b Berimrd street.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1897.
The Chinese Crowded the Gty Prison Like Rats and Were Grouped in Every Conceivable
Attitude of Dejection.
MONGOLS WILL
MAKE A FIGHT
Chinese Gamblers Will Re
sist the Action of
the Police.
An Appeal Will Be Made to the
Supreme Court for Pro
tection.
Several Hundred Pagan Prisoners
Huddled Like Rats in the City
Prison Corridors.
Police Court Judge Joachimsen's pa
tience has been rattier exhausted in the
plethora of Chinese cases be:ore b!m.
There is the case of Wing Sine and
Chin Poy, jointly accused of murdering
"Little Pete," and there are the cases of 242
Chinamen arrested last Saturday night in
gambling- houses.
"It's enough to rile any Judge," said
the venerable jurist, "but I don't pro
pose to have my calendar clogged up with
these cases. I'll give them the statutory
cominuance of a couple of days and then
they will have to be heard."
In the meantime Warrant Clerk F. G.
Drury has been unable to attend to any
thing else during the past two working
days but make out 242 complaints against
the arrested Chir se, and all other ca.Â«cs
have had to be sent to the other courts
for attention.
Downstairs in the City Prison corridors,
where the bulk of the prisoners huve been
confined, there has been more trouble and
annoyance.
Each prisoner has a friend or two who
came to bail him out, and these must be
permitted to view the men so as to pick
out the right ones.
The consequence has been that with 242
prisoners in charge, Captain Robinson
and Sergeant Lindheimer have had their
hands full, caring also for a lew hundred
friende.
There is no use calling out names, for
they all sound alike, so when some pur
ticular prisoner is wanted the bondsman
has to be led in am ng the horde of
prisoners to pick out lih man.
It is no easy matter either 10 choose the
rignt man, for most of the prisoners are
being bailed out by the Chinatown gam
blers of high degree who would just as
soon leav- them in jail as not, excepting
that it would establish a bad precedent
and might hurt business in the future.
The prison rs lie about like so many ver
min, making themselves as comfortable as
possible on the cold stone flags. Some
lew have been lucky enough to secure
boards to keep off the chill from beneath,
and. odd to say, most of these boards are
relics of a former raid on the poolrooms
of the whites in downtown locations.
On Sunday a bail bond of $80 or a cash
i bond of $40 was required for the release of
the prisoners, but Judge Joachimeen re
duced this to $10 cash yesterday. As a
consequence but ninety prisoners re
mained in jail last night.
The Chinese propose appealing the cases
to the Supreme Court if necessary, hence
only four of them paid an average fine of
$10 yesterday morning.
MARY HATES BIG FEES.
The Sister of Them as Mootry Jr.
Thinks She Is Not Fairly
Treated.
Alleges That She Was Kept in the
Dark Regarding tha Setllem nt
of Accounts.
Mary Mootry,|a sister of the late Thomas
M otry Jr., has filed a petition in Judge
Coffey's conrt to have iet aside the onler
for the settling of the account and the dis
tribution of said Thomas Mootry's estate.
Miss Mootry complains that she was not
fauly >reated by Henry A. Crane, execu
tor of her brother's will, nor by M. Mul
lany. thÂ« attorney for the executor. 6he
says at the time the order was made sbo
had no attorney of tier own and relied on
Mr. Chase and bis attorney for protection.
The laay avers that she is entitled to a
third of the estate, but that she has re
ceived only a small portion of the estate;
that the executor has $1000 in cash be
longing to her, ana that she wants it
rijrlit away.
In the petition filed through her attor
neys, Deal, Tauszky & Wells, she nlle es
that Executor Crane obtained $2427 fiS
from her brother's estate for ordinary
compensation and $572 32 for extraordin
ary services, whereas in fact he was not
entitled to more than $1000 nil told. Thu
executor's attorney got $2000, although
$1000 would have been ample compensa
tion.
In pressing her reauest for the vacating
of the order settling the executor's ac
count Miss Mootry says that she had no
notice of the intention of the executor to
present his account on tne date it was
offered, and was prevented irom beinj;
pre.-ent in court by the fact that the ex
ecutor and his attorney declined to inform
her of the facts though she endeavored to
ascertain thpm. She did not know the
account had been filed until three days
after it had been allowed.
A FORGED RECEIPT.
Kaphael TM:iÂ» Secured leu Dollars aud

Raphael Bias, who gives his occupation
as a laborer, was booked at the City Prison
yesterday afternoon by Detective Ross
Whitaker and Detective Thacker of Wells,
Fargo & Co. on a charge of forgery.
Yesterday morning Bias telpehoned to J.
O. Moitza of San Pablo to send $10 by
Wells, Farjro <fc Co.
"Who is speaking?" asfced Moitza.
"This is Mr. Tuompson," replied Bias.
"All right," said Moitza, thinking it

"bend it to 1023 Kearny street," replied
Bias.
The $10 was sent to 1028 Kearny street
through Wells, Fargo <fe Co. and Bias re
ceived it and s.pned W. B. Thompson's
name to the receipt.
Later in the day Moitza came to the City

SULLIVAN'S MEN
MUST FIGHT FIRE
And the Police, He Says,
Should Keep Theater
Aisles Clear.
Firemen Cannot Do That Work
and Also Perform Regular
Duty.
Explanation of the Ordinance Which
Was Brought Before the Super
visors Monday.
Chief Sullivan of the Fire Department
Inspired the ordinance which was pre
sented for adoption to the Supervisors by
Supervisor Britt Monday aiternoon, in
reference to tne use of police to keep clear
the aisles and lobbies of theaters or other
places of amusement during performances.
Heretofore this duty has devolved upon
the Fire Department.
"I have not thought out how many po
lice it will take to look out for the thea
ters and prevent overcrowding and so on,"
said Chief Sullivan yesterday. "I think
that about ten men would be sufficient.
There are enough men in the Police De
partment to do the duty and who can be
used for the purpose without interferinc
with the general routine. Very likely
officers on the beat could be used to pre
vent overcrowding ana the tilling up of
the theater aisles.
"The point is that people should be pre
vented from sitting in the aisles. It is
easier to stop this at the opening than it
is to move people after they have located
themselves for t:>e evening. It ought to
be plain enough for any one to see t , at it
is impossible lor one of us to be in a thea
ter and know of the alarm on the outside.
We simply cannot aitend to both duties,
and under the present arrangement we
mu<t slight one duty or the other.
"The proposed change, provided for in
the ordinance, would not change the rela
tions of ihe Fire Department in case of a
fire, as a ma-.ter of course. Then we would
have charge of the building. It is impor
tant that we should do tire duty; it is also
important that the law intendet to avert
danger by the overcrowding of any theater
should bo observed and enforced. The
plan that is set forth in the ordinance
seems to meet ihe requirements of tha sit
uation. That is all there is to it."

The Debris Dam Deadlock

The Miners' Association Trying
to Reconcile Senate and
Assembly.
Frank R Wehe's Compromise Resolu
tion of Request to tie Upper
Hous?.
At a meeting of the executive commit
tee of the Miners' Association, neld last
nieht in the rooms of the Union League
Club, the bill now pending in the Senate
appropriating $250,000 for tne construc
tion of debris dam- wa9 discussed.
The Senate and the Assembly are at log.
gerheads about some of the minor pro
visions of the bill, and there nre fears of
it n< t being patsod at all. The meeting
of the miners was to endeavor to effect a
compromise and make sure o' getting the
bill through at this session.
Senator Voomeis was present to repre
sent the wishes of the Senate in the mat
ter, and Assemblyman T. L. Ford was
spokesman for the views of the lower
house. Senator \Y. F. Prisk, who has
charge of the hill in the Senate, was also
present, and Judge P. D. Soward, who
controls it in the Assembly.
An amended bill was sent up from the
Assembly, and the Senate, being dis
sati>tied with this, has passed a substÂ»
tute bill, of which the Assembly does not
approve.
The Assembly wants the Debris Com
missioner appointed lor four years, with a
salary of $300 per month, and a secretary
to assist him. They wish him empowered
to examine and report upon all the
engineering work done and proposed.
The Senate objects to the lour years'
term, thinks the salary too high and the
secretary unnecessary. The members op
pose the powers conferred upon the Com
missioner and think it would be so offen
sive to the United States Engineers that
they would not submit to it and the Na
tional aid would be withdrawn. After a
long discussion it seemed thai no agree
ment conld be effected between the oppos
ing representatives of the two houses. At
ias>t Frank R. Wehe, a member the Miners'
Association executive committee, intro
duced a compromise resolution that passed
and happily broke the deadlock. It was
as follows:
That this committee recommend that the
Assembly bill for the appropriation of $250,
-000, passed by the Assembly and now pend
liiK in the Senate.be amended in the Senate
so as to Mgree with the substitute to Senate bill
No. 109, entitled "An act to provide," etc., ex
cept that the act provide for the appointment
of a Debris Commissioner for four years in
stead ol two yean, as provided lor in the Sen
ate substitute.
After referring some minor matters to
the committee on legislation the meeting
adjourned.

FERRIER BADLY
BEATEN BY DAVID
Could Never Get Within
Hailing Distance of the
Gelding.
The Talent Received Some Aw
ful Setbacks at Emeryville
Track.
Scotch Rose F.nishei B yond the
Moneyâ Gorge Miller Wen at
Fruitful Odds.
Of the niar.y upsets that occurred at the
Emeryville track yesterday tbe defeat of
Ferrier by David was the most surprising
as well as startling. Tnere was a finish to
the Wawekus gelding's style of going that
has not been heretofore apparent. He
skimmed along through the soft and
oozy going as though he had at la~t found
his native element, and Ferrier never got
close enough to him to tell his color. The
pair met in an owners' handicap at a
mile, along with Joan and Mahogany.
David had up ninety pounds and was
piioted by young ClawFon, while Mr.
Hunn's hor6e was ridden by Tod Sloan
and carried ninety-eight pounds in the
saddle. Ferrier was the hottest kind of a
favorite in the betting, his admirers
quickly forcing the odds down from 7 to
10 to 3to 5. Seven to five was laid atra:n>t
David at the start, which price ia:er
lengthened out a shade. The race is easy
of description. David sailed to the front,
flattered Ferrier once by daking him
think tbat he was backing up, and then
drew away again and won by as far as he
wanted to, reaching the judges' stnnd ten
or twelve lengths ahead of the favorite in
1:44. Joan came in later, and shortly
after Mahogany was scratched off the
missing list.
This is not the only dump to record
over the day's sport, which it might be
appropriately from a bookmaker's point
of view. The dumps were many and it
might be safely predicted that had any
one of the many hundreds of racegoers
returning to this side from the track been
unfortunate enough to fall overboard off
one of the ferry-boats, the unfortunate,
after sinking, would never again have i
reached the surface from the weight of
losing pool tickets on iiis perÂ«on. The
prevailing shower* kept the track muddy
and greasy and one after another hot
favorites w>-re tumbled over. It remained
for Three Forks to take tne concluding
event, starting a lukewarm choice.
Fourteen "crabs" started in the open
ing six-lurlong dash with no pronounced
favorite in the betting. At the end
Heartsease, a 10 to 1 shot ridden by Pig- J
fjott. won ea3iiy by four lengths from |
Monitor. O'Fieeta with Marty Bergen un !
was a ciose tnird.
Al Stemler's filly, Scotch Ro=e, consid- i
*>red one of the cinches of the card, was a ;
3 to 5 chance to win the live and a half
lurlong purse that was next decided. She |
ran out in the lead to the stretch and then ]
nassed it up. Sweet William, at odds of j
4 to 1, then took command and won easily !
irom Naranja, a 4 to 1 shot carrying the
Baldwin colors.
Pat Dunne never does get very long odds
apa^.Â«t his horses, and Benamela was no j
exception, going to the post a 9 to 10 !
choice for the mile and a furlong selling
affair "vith a field of live starting. Perseus,
the 9to 5 second choice with Sloan in the
saddle, led him from the jump, passing i
the stand three lengths clear, with the j
favorite an eased up second to front of j
Foremost.
Tbe local favorite, George Miller, was i
more successful at his second essay this j
season. With "Skeeta" Martin up, he was i
as gpod as 8 to 1 in the betting on the fifth
event over seven furlongs, and leading
throughout, disposed of Caliente very
handily at the cud by a length in 1:32.

the betting proposition in the last race of
the day, a six-furlong Bprint, decided

turned un in Three Forks, which receded
in the betting from Btosto 11 to 5, lead

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1897.
WINEMEN OPPOSE
A LOWER TARIFF
They Will Also Guard
Against Reciprocity
Treaties.
Their Convention Warmly Dis
cussed These Matters
Yesterday.
A Committee Appointed to Act in the
Interests of Ca ifornia
Growers.
Some of the most representative wine
grower* and dealers of California met in
convention this morning, under the
auspices or tne Collego of Practical Viti
culture, for the purpose primarily of dis
cussing the pending reciprocity treaty
between the United States and France
and of determining the advisability of
taking action in opposition thereto, as a
measure calculated to injure the wine
industry of this State. The result of the
convention's deliberations was a resolu
tion empowering the chairman to appoint
a committee of live to look alter affairs in
I Washington, in conjunction with the
Eastern representatives and to take the
necessary steps to oppose reciprocity in no
far as it is likely to injure the State
i wine industry. The State Legislature will
also be icquested to loivrard resolutions to
Washington and 10 see that tho interests
of the wine-growers are properly repre
sented. An amendment was addt-d to the
foregoing, to the effect that in view of ihe
fact thai the liner and older varieties of
California wine are seriously suffering
under the present tariff regulations, this
committee should ba instructed to
earnestly advocate a judicious increase in
the present schedule of our wine tariff.
Among tne memlers present were the
following: Arpad llurasztuy, Charles A.
Wetniore, Clarence Wetruore (represent
ing the L-ivermore Valley interests), John
Swett, Mr. Croft, William Scott, A. fcbar
boro, A. P. Hayne of the State University,
P. Duvauz of Mission San Jose, William
Palrntag of Hoilister and tho San Bemto
County region, B. H. Upham of Contra
Costa County, E. P. Sagar of the Eisen
Vineyard Company, Emil Gamier of Emil
Gamier & Co., P. T. Morgan of the Cali
fornia Wine Association, Charles Bund
schu of the Gunrtlach-Bundscliu Wino
Company, J. J. Jacobi of Lathman &
Jacobi, Peter ot the Santa Cruz
wine depot, K. W. Lominer of St. Heleno,
K. Jordan and R. Jordan Jr. of Napa,
Paxton ol Sonoma.
President Arpad Hara-'zthy called the
convt-ntion to order toon after 11 o'clock
yesterday morning in the Chamber of
Commerce hail, and briefly explained the
object of the gathering as staled above.
â¢It has been rumored," he said, '"and
you have no doubt seen some blight inti
mation in the newspapers that such a
treaty was about to be established, and
that Eastern importers would derive some
benefits tuerefroru, together with a casual
inference that the wine industry of Cali
fornia would suffer by the admission -jf
French wines at much lower figures tiiun
heretofore.
"This rumor has beer, confirmed by pri
vate letters from the East, stating that ac
tion is about to be taken by large canners,
such as Armour, for tha purpose of intro- I
ducing t; eir canned goods into France.
Alter having considered the->e matters, it
is proposed to deal with the subject of
bottling in bond. It has been suggested
that we shoud have some representative
sent East, and I itiso hog to state tbe ad
visability of either raising or maintaining
the present tariff on imported wines. I
would line to hear from gentlemen pres
l ent on these subjects."
Charles Bundscher said he would like to
know whether tho convention had any
other than newspaper information to pro
ceed upon. Some of the local papers had
contended that the old tariff schedule of
40 or 50 cents should be reinstated, while
others urged that the present rate should
be sustained.
J. J. Jacobi said that he bad received a
letter from Congressman Loud, i;i which
he stated that nothing had been done be
yontl the committee's recommendation
that the old McKinley tariff should be re
established. As far as reciprocity was
concerned they had heard nothing from
Washington to lead them to believe that
any decided action had been taken.
Secretary W. Scott informed the con
j vention that he had a letter from the Wine
I and Spir.t Traders' Society of New York,
in which he was informed that reciprocity
would be supported, and that the present
schedule of 30 cents for dry wines and 50
cents for sweet wines would be main
tained.
The chairman pointed out the necessity
for immediate action, as the Congres
sional committees were now hard at work
on tbe reciprocity question.
J. J. Jacobi here moved for the ap
pointment of a committee to cuard
against reciprocity affective tbe wine in
dustry of the State. He suggested also
j that this committee of two or three
! should have power to delegate Us func
tions to others. People like Jacobi &
Browfeldt ot. New York had access to the
Ways and Means Committee; they were
continually posted, and should the neces
sity arise they could be In Washington in
ten or fifteen hours. Mr. Jacobi did not
consider it wise to expose their hand in
ibis matter in the presence of the pre*s.
Mr. Bundsch believed they all op
posed the scheme of reciprocity, if con
ditions wore offered to Western packers,
under which they could export their
meats to Europe, while the wine growers
here were sacrificed. But did the conven
tion desire to favor un increase in the
present tariff, or did it consider the pres
ent duty satisfactory ? He thought that
the committee sugeested by Mr. Jacobi
should enlarge its scope so as to include
! the whole question of reciprocity and
tariff.
Mr. Jacobi, however, would not accept
the amendment for the reason that under
j the present tariff they knew they would
not be injured to any deadly "extent,
though tome might tbink it advisable to
restore the duty to what it was a few years
aco. But Mr. Jacobi held that it was a
bad policy to go into battle with divided
forci-s and hp, therefore, wished to leave
the tariff auestion entirely in tbe back
ground. Reciprocity was such a serious
menace that tuey could not afford to bur
den themselves with any other business.
If the Ways and Means Committee gave
'them a 50cent duty, or should the com
mittee leave it at 30 cents, none of them
would, be seriously injured.
John Swett considered it advisable to
appoint a committee for one specific pur
pose, but did not think the convention
should dodge any issue. Personally he
believed the tariff was as high as it should
be and that they could uo fairly well
under it, though a higher tariff might
benefit them temporarily. A second com
mittee should be appointed to consider
this q;ios;ion.
W. Wehnicr said be had thought that
when they voted for McKinlev it was on
the assumption that tho tnriff would not
be lowered. It would certainly be â  bad
thine; to have both McKinley and a lower
tar ff. [Laughter].
C. A. Weiruore earnestly contended tbat
the convention should stand by its agree
ment with the New York Wine and Spirit
Traders' Society at the time the tariff was
last adjusted. He expressed himself in
favor oi reciprocity, though it might be
well to define the kind of reciprocity they
wanted. But he did not see any harm in
Chicago trying to extend the market for
canned goods to European countries.
To-day they could not export one gallon
of spirits to France because there they
had two tariffsâ a high one applied to the
world generally, ana a. low one applied to
those countries which treated them well.
Suppose Congress was asked to empower
the Government to add 50 per cent to
every item in the tariff and 25 per cent on
the free list to the country which did not
place the United States on the footing of
the. roost fnvored nation? Then France
â¢ might bo expected to extend to us the
privilege we do not now enjoy.
Mr. Jacoby asserted that California only
accepted the 30-cent duty as a compro
mise. The convention was not opposing
general reciprocity, but merely wine re
ciprocity, nor did he see why ihcy should
be sacrificed upon an altar of Illinois
canned goods.
At Mr. Morgan's suggestion several of
the winemakers present spoke on the
question. P. C. Rossi said that the large j
major: of winemakers desired an in
crease In the tariff. lie informed the con
vention that he was able to state authori
tatively that California wines could not
realize a high price because Bordeiaise sold
in New York at 55 and 50 cents a gallon
and a certain prejudice existed in its
favor. In the face of these condition?, a |
short crop here calculated to raise the
price of native wines 5 or 10 cents a gallon,
would immediately brine them into com
petition with Spanish and Italian wines.
Mr. Palton expressed similar sentiments
on behalf of Sonoma County. Mr. Crabbe
called attention to the manufacture of
spurious wines in Eastern vineyards, and
added that if the 50-cent duty were re- j
stored it would be necessary to have a
pure National wine law in order to derive
any great benefit from it.
Mr. Rossi said that the only reason why
artificial wines were not consumed in
greater quantities was because people
were able to discriminate between them
and the purer varieties, but that wines
could be manufactured with sugar at half j
the price of those manufactured with i
grapes here, and that manufacturers us.
sugar would certainly make more when
the duty was 50 cents than now when it
was 30. But under a duty of 50 cents the i
higher class wines would bo better pro
tected and the cheapen varieties would be
regulated by competition. In Italy the
law proposed to include the wines manu
factured with raisins as belonging to the
artificin 1 category.
Mr.Sbarboro provoked Mr. Bundschu's
indignation by affirming '.hat the wine tar- j
iff question was decided at the time of the !
last election, and that many wine-makers |
on the Democratic side of the house voted j
for McKinley for that reason. To reverse J
that decision and declare tnat they wished
matters to remain as they were would be i
ridiculous. Mr. Bundscbu held that far I
greater issues were involved and, reverting j
to the subject under discussion, advised the
trade, while holding fast to what it already
had, to ask for more.
Ha moved therefore that in view of the
fact that California wines are seriously
suffering under the present tariff regula
tions the committee be instructed to
earnestly advocate a judicious increase in
the present schedule of our wine tariff.
This was carried with the understanding
that the committee consist of five mem
bers, who will be named by the chairman
in the course of a few days.
The secretary before the convention ad
journed explained the bill recently intro
duced into Congress by Evans of Louis
ville on the subject of bottling in bond.
The bill provides that any distiller with a
certificate of twenty bushels capacity of
grain shall have the right to bottle his
whbkies in bond practically under the
samo regulations as those under which
whiskies are now bottled in Canada.
The legulations respecting brandy will
drawn up by the Commissioner of In
ternal Revenue. This law does not pro
vide for the blending of different ages,
and th* distiller can only reduce in-proof,
without adding color, nor can the product
of two distilleries be bottled.- A vain-at
tempt was made a year ago by Mr. Evans
to Ret the privilege of blending altered.
The convention, however, did not act
on the foregoinc, and adjourned sine die.
THE ABBOTT AGREEMENT
Expert Kytka Says Her Mar
riage Contract Was
Fabricated.
Hi Agrees With Experts Ames and,
Cavalho in Regard to Erasures
en the Pfpers
T. Kytka, an expert in photography nnd
handwriting, gave some strong testimony
in J udge Seaweli's court yesterday against
the claims of Mrs. Nancy Abbott to be
tbe wife of Thomas M. Quackenbush, an
aged capitalist.
Hr. Kytlca swore that in his opinion the
so-called marriage contract between Mrs.
Abbott and Mr. Quackenbush was a fabri
cated document. He said that the paper
bearing Quaokeabush's genuine signature
had formerly contained some other writ
ing which 4iad been erased and that the
so-called contract had been written over
tho first writing.
Another paper on which Mrs. Abbott
placed great reliance was designated as
the Thanksgiving acknowledgment of
marriage, which read as follows:
November 30, 1893,
Took my ThanKsgivin? dinner with tuy wife
to-day. There Is no place for me like home.
May the Lord spare us to have many dinners
together, [signed.] N. a Quackenbush,
T. M. Q.
This was by Mr. Kytka declared to be
alÂ«o in the nature of a palimpsest. He
said that he could detect some of the orig
inal words with the naked eye, and when
he applied the microscope he couid clearly
discover that the original date was April
instead of November.
According to Mr. Kytka's opinion the
work of erasure had been performed with
an ordinary rubber eraser, and he drew
attention to the "woolly" appearance of
the surface of the paper on which the dif
ferent contracts had been written. He
thought the signatured by Quackenbush
were genuine, but that when written they
were appended to orders for merchandise
and the like, as ho was able to make out
parts of words that would indicate such
to be their nature. Mrs. Abbott admitted
that the contracts were written by herself,
so tbe logical conclusion, if tbe erasures
had been made, was that she or some one
in her interest had done the worK.
Experts Ames and Cavalho of New York
examined these disputed documents some
time ago, and gave it as their opinion that
they were false and fabricated, agreeing
substantially with the theory advanced
by Mr. Kytka.
The taking of testimony was declared
closed, and argument by counsel will be
beard next Tuesday.

JUSTICE GETS A

An Agreement That Will

Hall.
Raver Says He Will Have the
Debris on the Site Quickly
Removed.
Architect Shea and tin Supervisors,
Tired of Waiting, Force a
SudJea Move.
Work on the Hall of Justice may now
proceed. The Buildings Committee of
ihe Board cf Supervisors met yesterday.
The chairman of the committee is Super
visor Sheehan, whose brother-in-law, Mr.
Buckley, was on Monday appointed sup
erintendent of construction on that baild
i ing. Before the committee yesterday
appeared "Jake" Raver and Architect
Frank Shea. Shea had caused Mr. Raver
to be called to do something to speed him
in the clearing away of the debris from
the site upon which the new building will
stand. This purpose was accomplished,
I for before Kauer left the committee-room
i he had signed a document of which the
j following is a copy :
San Francisco, Keb. 16, 1897.
In consideration ot the material received ol
the old City Halt building and the contract
made with the Mayor ol said City and County
to tear aown the said building and remove ail
the material from said lot, I hereby aninorize
the architect, Frauk Shea, to remove all the
dirt, debris, brick or other material from snld
lot, and that all expense incurred in the per
formance ot said woric will be mot and paid by
me on demand of said architect.
J. J. Raver.
Raver, It wiil be recollected, secured the
material of the old City Hall for $600
| with the agreement that he should re
move ail the debris and all the old build
ings from the site, leaving a clear site for
the new building. The old City Hall was
torn down and the debris accumulated up
on a solid concrete floor. Instead of tirst
carting away tho debris, the contractor to
whom Raver had sublet the job pulled up
the concrete in great blocks and moved
that.
Some time ago Architect Shea wanted
to view the foundations of the old buihi
inp, and secured an allowence of $100 from
the Supervisors to dig a trench all around

to light the large amount of work vet to
be done in the removal of the buildings.
The contractor for Raver, slowly plodding
along tiled ut> this trench and this some
what exciied "Architect Shea. The next
move was to bring Raver before the com
mittee and try to have the work accele
rated and also to have â  complete job
made of it. With Raver was the con
tractor.
Raver protested that he was not re
sponsible for any delay and said that he
would just as soon have a hundred m< n at
work. Ho also promised greater haste.
Architect Shea reminded the committee
tnat Mr. Raver had made similar pronv
ises before and requested that he sham*
sign a paper. Ti>en Clerk Russell of the
Board or Supervisors drew up the paper
already mentioned, to which Rai:er at
tached his signature, saying that he was
suited.
Architect Shea was suited and ao was
the committee, which was a happy condi
tion of affairs all round. The salary of
the new Snnerintendent of Construction,
which is $250 per month, will bejsm as
soon as construction is actually begun.
There will be a lively scratching of dirt

Lodges nnd Encampments 'Will Not
Join the Gnldon Gate Carnival.
There was a meeting of representatives
from the subordinate lodges, encamp
ments and Rebekah lodges of order of
Odd Fellows in Old Fellows' Hall on
Saturday night.
Grand Secretary Qeoree T. Shaw pro
sified and the several representatives pre
sented the views of the bodies they repre
sented in the matter of taking part in the
Golden Gate Carnival celebration.
It was proposed to have an O.id Fellows'
day on the 2Gth of April, the anniversary
of the founding of the ordrr, and the
proposition was laid before the carnival
committee. That body announced its
willingness to do all it could in the way of
courtesy to the order, but found upon con
sultation that the dale named could not
be designated as "Odd Fellows' day."
Tuis bavins been reported to the various
bodies it seemed to have had its effect,
for when the roll was called it was found
that fourteen sut.ordinate lodges, three
encampments and one Rebekah lodge
were opposed to tukin^ part in the carni
val, that live subordinates and Rebekah
lodges were in favor of the proposition
and that tnreo lodges were willing to go
with the majority.
That put a stop to any further action in
the matter, and the committee adjourned

._ work for a large number of deserving per- \
â â  . sons who are out of employment and are }
, eager for an opportunity to earn a livirg.
:"â¢; . Ti.ree possible solutions are suggested.
' ' One is to adopt the so-called Pingree ;
.. p an, very successfully employed in recent â¢
â¢years by Mayor I'ingree of Detroit, by i
â . *hich vacant city lots, through the privi- i
J :e accorded by their owners, are given |
A; er temporarily to the unemployed to be |
â¢ used as vegetable gardens. Another is to j
. . provide a regular municipal fund, to be !
" used in carrying on public works. An- j
â :"'. other is to adopt the Australian plan !
â¢ ' 0! rinding men work in the placer mines. |
Still another in to form agricultural colo- ;
'.' nies on tracts of cheap land in far out- j
lying districts of the State. And another
â¢â  yet will be forthcoming before some \
â¢â¢definite action is taKen to-morrow by the
: . -conference, to be held in the Mayor's i
â¢c-ffice.
:. JSi- Mayor Sutro said yesterday that he '
: . . heartily indorses the Pingree plan as one i
". of practical value to the City, where ail '
the land on the peninsula can be made to ;
.produce vegetables. He cited tne cases of
.'ltalians to whom he has rented a large '
â number of acres, and who, he is assured, j
. are making a very decent living from
â  'â¢their vegetable gardens.
'â ;; ' The use by the unemployed of vacant
.; land within a city is not, he said, a propo
â¢fs-ition peculiar to the East. He himself
.'.advocated it here about eight years ago.
:.v "What I have long contended for," de
clared Mr. Sutro, "is the establishment of I
} )- a public fund to be expended annually i
-'â¢Upon works calculated to improve and i
: bearutify the City. Let it be a ball million

â¢ ''. The estate thus placed in dispute is
; valued at $100,000, and according to the
' ferrns of the will the greater part of the
:.' property is devised to Miss Lillie H.

and claim that they would have been more
â¢ liberally dealt with if his mind had not
. been" .unduly swayed by others, and par
. ticularly by Miss Theurkauf.
In support of their position in this re
gard, the contestants have presented a
.' document giving their side of the ques
". tion. Primarily they assert that at the
time decedent signed the instrument
which purports to be his will he was not i
of. sound or disposing mind. Then follows |
.â¢ this statement:
. . In September, 1895, the decedent became i
â¢M-riously and aangerously in, suffering
(among other ailments) with an enlargement ;
. ot the spleen and liver, and he also had '
' . typhoid pneumonia, in consequence of which, !
he wa* confined to his bed until about the '
â¢â ' 10th of November, 1895.
â¢ Continuing from that date to the time of his j
death, on i lie 24th of January, 1897, said tie- !
i â  dent suffered â  continuously from the dis- !
'â¢ easel mentioned, from the effects of which he !
. Dually died. Kver afer he arose from his bed â¢
of sickness in November, 1895, /ie was con- '
. Ur.-uously abnormally morose, irritable, im- j
' l>ul live arid capricious and groundlessly ms
-1 'clous of thoiMJ around him. He suffered
â irom loss of appetite, insomnia and from
. . v Â«&ue fears of purely Imaginary evils.
Such* mental and physical conditions, the !
â¢ contestants allege, affected his mind to such i
Â«ii extent that he was not on the 27th day of j
: Jane, 1800, the date of the will, capable of <
â  making a valid will.
Then is presented to the court the
.second allegation in the contest, being in
â¢â¢. BVbstance as follows:
<|At the time of the making and signing of
tf.d will the said decadent acted under un
tsue influence and misrepresentations, In this,
'to wit :
That one Lillie 11. Theurkauf, for long time
prior to the date of the sinning of tsaia will,
had implanted in his mind a belief that she
would eventually become his wife, whereas,
on the contrary, she did never intend to
marry him, and only induced him to believe '
6ne would marry him for the sole purpose of I
unduly engrossing his thoughts and unduly I
influencing his mind generally In her behalf. ;

Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald pro
poses to find work in the mines for the
unemployed of this City.
"The solution of the problem of the
unemployed," said he yesterday, "lies in
taking advantage, of the mining field. It
would not be necessary to raise any large
fund to do this, and the Labor Bureau
and Mining Bureau, by co-operating,
i could attend to all the details of placing
; the men. The Mining Bureau has Held
surveyors at work, who could give infor-
I mation as to the best locality|for the men,
and my office would attend to the rest.
Since I opened the free employment
j bureau I have sent over 10,000 men into
the country and all have raised their own
I fares. It has at times been necessary to
J get reduced rates for them, but they were
1 never found destitute.
"I think there would be no trouble
I about sending them to work in the
| placers. I have been instrumental in
; placing several men at work, and they
nave done well. There are claim-owners
I in the mining districts who are very
j anxious to get men to work them and ask
in return only that the men sell them
1 whatever gold may be taken out at $17 an
! ounce. Chinamen have lor years been
making a good thinn out of the placers.
I had opportunities in the Mint to see the
results of their labors, even on placers
that had been worked and abandoned by
white men, and know what can be done
there.
"The mining field here is the proper
one to do such work in, as the farming
business is overdone. Tiie employment
of men in that way would be a good
thing for the State, as it would give per
manent employment at fairly good re
turns to a great many more men than
corporations. Should this idea be favor
ably received I can send a party of twenty
DECLARATION OF THIS CITY'S UNEMPLOYED.
The San Francisco unemployed, in mass-meeting assembled, yesterday after
noon adopted the following as a preamble to their constitution and by-laws :
"It is our determination to stand shoulder to shoulder in a compact and orderly
organized body, to obtain employment at a compensation sufficient to keep a
family and to avoid falling back a dead weight on the community, as it is our desire
not alone to provide temporary subsistence for the unfortunate and starving people
in the City, but principally to endeavor to put them in the way of obtaining some
thing tangible and. lasting in the shape of eroplojraWÃt* Â»o as not to be calling for
help again in a short period of time."
the will be refused admission to probate
as the will of Louis F. Reichling. deoeawd.
Miss Thenrkauf, who *as in Judge
Slack's court with her attorney, Â« x-Judze j
John F. Daris of Araador County, was
quietly attired and is a modest-appearing,
good-looking voting laay. She is a cousin
of the deceased and it appears has been
residing in New York City for nearly a
year and was residing there at the time
the will was made. Another cousin of the
d^cea^ed, named Cornolia, who is also a !
cousin of Miss Tbeurkauf and resides in >
Cincinnati, is also a iegatee under the j
will, but no mention of her is made in the j
contest fiied. The brother and sister,
who make the contest, were left a large
estate by their father a short tiiue before
the death of their brother.
When asked for a statement of the other
side of the case the young lady's attorney
declined to discuss the matter. "The
allegations in the opposition are beneath i
contempt," said Juuge Davis, '*and are
merely another instance of the inability of
relatives to respect the wishes of the dead
when in his will he leaves his property
where his heart dictates instead of to
themselves. 1 '

lor forty men out within forty -eight;
hours."'
The unemployed have no definite plans
as yet. They are willing to do anything
that will provide continuous employment,
j but they are emphatically opposed to be
ing made objects for temporary charity
from societies providing food and shelter.
They do not wish to be placed in the cate
gory of alms-seekers. They want work.
A mass-meeting, attended by over 300
unemployed men, was held yesterday in
the Turk-street Temple. The situation
was discussed and several addresses were
made by persons interested in helping the
unfortunate men.
A commodious building on Howard
street that had seemed within their reach
as a common shelter and co-operative
economical boarding quarters was, upon
special investigation by Chairman Lef
! iingwell, found unrentable for the pur
pose because of the objections of neigh
boring property-owners.
During the absence of the chairman for
I an hour while investigating this proposeu
j shelter J. Fabe acted as temporary cuai/- |
i man. Addresses were made by Delegate i
i Alsop from the wageworkers of New
Zealand, by Rev. J. E. Scott, by E. J. 8a
â¢ vilie and by J. Fabe, Jones, O'Shea and
others of the unemployed.
Alsop, citing the process of a similar
movement in Auckland, New Zealand,
suggested that the execuive committee of
the unemployed pursue the co-operative
plan and ask also that the City give the
organized unemployed tue preference as
workmen upon all public contracts. Such
a scneme would free these poor men from
the necessity of competition witn persons
in a less distressiue position and would do
away with a hopelessly unemployed class.
The sense of the meeting was expressed
I as strongly opposed to accepting tem
j porary relief from any charitable organi
| zations. The men seeking honest wor.'cdo
i not wish the movement to degenerate into
i a system of soud kitchen relief. They
want a chance to earn their food and to
earn it not only now but during some time
to come. A constitution was adopted eai
i bcdyine these sentiments.
After the meeting the executive com
| mittee decided to issue propsr credentials
! to persons that will begin to-day to collect
j from private persons contributions of old
bedding, old clothing, dishes and like
articles to be used by the men as soon as
i a temporary shelter shall be provided
| whero they may begin housekeeping on a
i cheap co-operative plan,
Peisons having things :o contribute are
i requested to notify G. B. Wright, secre
! tary for the unemployed, 117 Turk street,
j stating their name, address and what they
; wisD to give, so that it may be known
j whether or not it will be necessary to send
the wagon for the contribution. In any
event persons are warned against giving
: to men not possessed of properiy indorsed
I certificates from the secretary of the an
! employed. *
A part of Mayor Phelan's cash contribu-
I tion of $2cO was spent yesterday upon ten-
I cent-meal tickets, which were issued to al

, very hungry, penniless men.
CARSON RATES
ARE NOW FIXED
Those Who Want to See
the Big Mill Can
Figure on It.
They Can Now Tell Exactly
How Much It Will
Cost Them
A M Ardery Arrives From Carson
and Arranges for Sidetracking
In Pullmans
General Passenger Agent Goodman of
the Southern Pacific oas completed a full
list of rates (mm points in California to
Carson during tne battle between Corbett
and Fitzsimmons. He has also made
rates for Portland, Ogden, El Paso and
other places. The rates, aside from the
round-tnp rate of $16 40 between San
Francisco and Carson, as hit' erto pub
lished, are in almost all cases new.
"To Carson and return from San Fran
cisco," said Mr. Goodman, "the rate will
?tand at $16 40.
"From Sacramento the round-trip rate
will be $12 40, from Monterey and Santa
Cruz $2u 40, from Los Angeles and San
Bernardino $:0, from Mariccpa $43 65,
from E! Pauo $55. from Oj{dens3tf 40. This
last is not the basic rate, which I have no
doubt will be arranged. Tuis will be $35.
The rate from Portland will be $42.
"As for tlie railroads East which desire
to co-operate with us, we have received a
proposition irom one line which would
make tne rate from Chicago to Carson
and return $84 80. Another line offers a
rate of $76 50, which is a little more than
one far^; $75 50 would be one 10 Carson.
"However, nothing is settled yet. Other
propositions will be received, and we will
near the arguments of different kinds.
"As to tlie many Pullmans that have
bnen reported engaged, some of them
have been really engaged and some not.
The best way to engage them is to pat up
the money, or else they may find when
they want them that somebody else has
got them."
it is said that twenty Pullmans, each
capable of holding twenty-four persons,
and the whole with a capacity of 480 per
sons have been secured by different par
ties from ihe Bouihern Pacific Company.
The supply of Pullmans, it is believed,
will be too light for the demand. For
over a week the road has been collecting
the Pullmans that conld be spared from
various places in the "West and on the
coast.
"Every little puny station is telegraph
ing and wanting a Pullman," said Mr.
Goodman. "From one place the other
day we got an inquiry asking what rate
we would give for forty peopls. I have
no idea they oan get fifteen there.
"It is very important for us to know
whether Stuart is going to give this
three days' tournament at Carson in con
nection with the big right. If he can get
his talent together, and it is known in
lime, probably a goou many would re- 1

A. M. Ardery. who has been with Stunrt
at Carson for several days past, hns re
turned here and fju erday called on Man
ager Fillmore. He wantei to arrange for
all the I'ul.man trains to go straight to
Carson and be switched there on side
tracks. Considering this in the nighest de
cree necessary for the comfort of those
who were to go he wanted to know if it
could be done.
Mr. Ardery was at once assured that it
could not only be done bit would *>e. It
is the idea to run the cars over the Vir
ginia and Truckee track from Reno to
Carson, a distance of thirty-on^ miles.
The Reno and Truckee conductors and
brakemen will take charge of the trains on
their arrival in Reno, but the original en
gineers will continue with the trains.
The Virginia and Truckee track is said
to be strong and the curves all right for
any cars, however big.
PASTORS' STANDING.
Cona;reipatlonalistÂ« Disrnsn With What i
Denominational Itmlv the Minis
terial Position Shall Rest.
An executive session of tho Bay AiÂ«o
ciation was held yesterday at the First
Congregational Church, the subject under
discussion being the question of whether
the standing of Congregational pastors is
to rest with the Bay Conference or the
Bay Association.
Rev. Dr. ilallock read a paper, the ob
ject ot which was to prove that the minis
terial standing should be held in the Bay
Association, as it is a body composed of
ministers exclusively, whereat the Bay !
Conference is composed of ministers and j
two lav delegates from each church.
Dr. Nash read a paper showing that, ac
cording to Congregational uÂ»age, the pas
torn' standing should rest with the con
ference.
In the discussion most of the pastors
took the view upheld by Dr. Nash. The
papers had been so lengthy, however, that j
the conference adjourned without arriving
at any decision.
The tallowing pastors were present:
Rev. Dr. Hall, Rev. G. C. Attains Rev.

Church met in joint session with the com
mittee recently appointed on the raising
of funds to build a new place of worship,

The list of church members was care
fully gone over, and the members of both
committees were assigned various ones to
see and ascertain what they would give to
swell the fund of $20,000 that has already
been subscribed. The belief is freely ex
pressed that if $50,000 is found necessary
for the new edifice it can easily be raised.

BUTLER TRIED
ON THE COAT
An Interesting Episode
During Yesterday's
Hearing.
Further Evidence in the Preston
Case From the Same
Witnesses.
Caplain Potrie of tha 0! vebink Tells
(f His Acqua ntance With
the Prison r-
The hearing on the application for ex
tradition in the case of Richard Ashe,
commonly called Butler, accused of mur
dering one Preston, was resumed yester
day afternoon in the Circuit Court, before
Commissioner Htacock. There was a
! much smaller attendance than heretofore.
The earlier portion of the proceedings
was monotonous, owing to the amount of
repetition involved in the evidence of
witnesses who had previously testified in
the Lee W Her case. The prisoner seemed
more alert and interested than u-ual,
however, and was in constant consnlta
| tion with his counsel, Attorneys Black
and PidwelJ, Leonard Stone being absent
for the nonce. Mr. Black himself fairly
beamed upon his client, whose sunburnt
neck he at one time during the hearing
affectionately encircled with his rieht
arm. The British Consul-General, J. W.
Warburton, went rapidly over the same
ground as before, with the only material
difference that Preston's name was sub
stituted for that of Captain Lee Weller.
Marshal Barry Baldwin and his deputy,
Thomas J. Gallagher, deposed to the
I serving of the warrants, in the face of a
i running fire of objections and motions to
1 strike out from the indefatigable Mr.
| BiacK.
Constable Conroy, recalled, repeated the
; story of his brief connection with the pris
i oner in Australia. Conroy's version ot the
I historical scene on the deck of the Swan-
I hilda evoked a smile. "I asked him if he
I knew me," said the witness, "and he said
ihe dian't. Sergeant Bunner told me to
I remove the whiskers, and the prisoner
1 then said, 'I have seen your face, 1 and
afterward he admitted knowing me and
giving me a map of the Aubrey mining
district." The witness said he had Riven
the defendant bis brother-in-law's address
at the Race Club Hotel, near Aubrey, at
his request, and that the defendant wrote
it down npon a small piece of paper. The
address in the checkbook was in his sis
ter's handwriting.
The checkbook was produced and Mr.
Cormac continued his examination. Con
roy insisted that the prisoner was called
Harwood when he knew him, and that
Harwood told him of his proposed trip to
the Blue Mountains.
Mr. Black began his cross-examination,
and induced the witness to state that be
was positive it was not to late as October
28 when he iast saw the prisoner with the
checkbook. A few questions addressed to
the witness by Mr. Cormac showed that
be had never seen the checkbook m Aus
tralia.
"So," eaid Mr. Cormac, "you must have
been mistaken when you stated that you
saw the checkbook in the prisoner's pos
session bef or.- October 28?"
Conroy explained that he thonght he
had been asked if his sister wrote down j
the address beiore that date. He was 1
sure his sister never saw the prisoner I
after September 10, 1596, because she was
with the witness during that period.
The court allowed the depositions in j
the Lee Weiler cisc to be admitted and |
tho reading dispensed with, except in the
case of witnesses present, who might be
examined orally.
Detective Eagan gave evidence to the
effect that the prisoner when asked by the j
witness xn the Marshal's office, "How
about this younu man Prestos:?" replied
that he h:id met him at the railway sta
tion. "Then," continued Eagan," Tasked
him how about the oid English miner?
He knew, I saia, too much about pros
pecting for you."
"I object," cried Black, "to the admis
sion ot evidence about the oid Engiieb
miner.'
The objection was allowed.
Detective Eagan gave way to the Aus
tralian detective Roche, who swore to the
depositions taKen before the magistrates j
in New South Wales and the chief con- '
su'.ar clnoer of the United States. He as- !
sured Mr. Cormac, albeit Mr. Black ob- |
jected, that he was familiar with the pen- j
ally jof murder provided by section 9of
the New South Wales criminal law amend
ment act. He described the search for
Preston's body and its exhumation.
Though he had never seen Preston alive j
he identified the body by means of a '
photograph. Toe body was carefully
buried at a varying depth of two and
three feet. The earth aoove seemed to
have been smoothed over with a spade
and seme dry sand sprinkled over it. A
towel, tisjhUv knotted, was passed under
one shoulder and over the other, and had
presumably been used to pull it into the
hole. The yon ml la Preston's head the
witness attributed to a rifle bullet. Tue
direction of the wound was downward
from the back. No rifle was found near
the locali.v at the time the body was ex
humed. There was no indication that
death had been suicidal.
Mr. Cormac, ignoring Mr. Backs pro
test, asked the witness if the articles
found in tiie prisoner's possession were
necessary evidence at the trial of the case.
"They are very material evidence," was
the reDiy. He then identified, from de
scriptions furnished him, a coat and vest
as having been Preston's property.
"There is a piece set in the bacic of the
vest," he went on. indicating the spot,
"and the coat is much too 'small lor the
prisoner. Preston weighed 150 pounds."
Mr. Black suggested that it might be
weil lor the prisoner to try on the coat.
Ashe jumped up with apparent alacrity,
and alter divesting himself of his blue
serge coat, put on the other, which was
obviously an ill fit.
â¢'Much too small in the chest." declared
the witness emphatically. "That coat
was never made for him."
At Mr. Black's request, Roche examined
through a magnifying glass a loose piece
of tweed cloth also found among the pris
oner's effects, and expressed his opinion
that the coat and vest were of different
material.
Mr. Black asked that all the foregoing
testimony concerning the identification
of clothing be strictcen out, as it was
clearly shown that tue witness' sources of
information were hearsay. The court re
fused to grant the motion.
The witness, still replying to Mr. Black,
stated that he obtained "the prisoner's sig
nature to the list of property without hav
ing told the prisoner that he wanted it as
a etieck upon the clerk. The officers
failed to find the bullet which killed
Preston, and in his opinion the bullets
found among the prisoner's baggage were
not small enough to have inflicted the
wound.
James J. Groom of Groom & Hogan,
fashionable batters, was called lo produce
an acknowledgment sicned by the pris
oner in the name of Butler, winch the
latter gave on receipt of a brand-new hat
in exchange for the prisoner's old one.
The witnes-i informed Mr. Blacfc tbat
when signing the acknowledgment the
prisoner remarked that Btr.lei was tao
name he was known* by in San Franc slO.
Constable Conroy, recalled, said the
prisoner was a little* stouter than at pres
ent when he knew him in Australia and
weighed, he thought, about 180 pounds.
He would weigh now only about 165
pounds. When the witness knew him he
wore a Scotch twee l coat.
Captain John Nicholson Petrie of the
Ol.vebank deposed that he knew the
prisoner very well. He was an A. B. and
sailed with the witness from Rio Janeiro,
February 17. 1893. The witness knew him
as Richard Ashe. "We proceeded to New
castle, N. y. W.," continued Captain
Petrie, "where he was discharged. I saw
him afterward in Newcastle a fortnight
before November 19. when we sailed. He
seemerl then much stouter. I remarked
when I saw him here that he had fallen
away. I never knew him by any other
name Than A3be."
Replying to Mr. Black, the witness ad
mitted that it was a very common ex
perience with captains tcfind sailors ship
ping under different names. This was
often necessary when they deserted. The
prisoner, when he met him in Newcastle,
was wearing a dark suit, and "it struck
me," continued the witness, "that he had
a good appearance.' I never knew him as
Frank Karwood, nor as Butler, nor as
Weller. Richard Ashe is the one name by
which I knew him. He was & fairly good
seaman, but when we got to Newcastle he
laid up. He asked for his ilischaree and
said he wanted to better himself. He told
me he had a mate's certificate. I never
had ar.y row with him at sea. He was not
disobedient nor insubordinate. I have
nothing against his character."
Mr. Cormac, in the course of re-examina
tion, elicited the information that a Dr.
Eames, who visited Ashe in the forecastle
when he complained of rheumatism, as
sured the witness there was very little the
matter with him. "When I offered him a
lotion for his knee," said Peirie, "he said
tome: 'No you won't, captain, do any
thing of the sort. I will do for you as I
did for the captain of the Star of Russia.'
I then gave him in charge for threatening
me on board the vessel."
"You toid Mr. Blact," said Mr. Cormac,
"that it was a common occurrence for
sailors to change their names. Is it not
equally common for fugitives from justice
to do the same?"
Objection sustained.
The hearing was then continued until
Thursday afternoon at 2 o'clock, Mr.
Cormac stating that it had been agreed
between counsel toareue both caseÂ« in'one.

Review lays: "Chicago packer hides continue to
advance despite the decline In the quality. A
block of 4010 November native steer hides
: brought 9\nC and 6COO of January slaughter sold
at 9Vic. All the reports from the Eastern leather
! markets indicate a firmer tone. . Large sales are
suit*, to have been made, the details of which are
not given out. An unusual amount of leather has
I been hauled through the streets, indicating that
j the long-delayed movement to the shoe factories
1 has begun in farm St. Ihe puckers are in a very
! strong position. For several weeks there has been
1 an active demand for all selections. Biandi-d
j hides were closely sold up for some time, but
native and buu-brands lagved behind, and there
was a conslderab.e a< cumulation. Of lute heavy
native s.eers mid cows and butt-brands have, how
ever, shared liberally in the neutral movement,
and at this writing not one selection has even a
semblance of weakness. The country h.de mar
| ket inn been uncertain and wobbly th s
week. At ihe very time some firms were trying
to work buffs from 8V* C up 10 BVfcc one bouse ou

Something Going On There.
Down in Ohio the other day, not very
far from Cleveland, I took a carryall or
bus at a country station to ride inland a
few miles. The driver, who carried the
mail for Uncle Sam, was disposed to be
quite communicaiive.
"You don't live 'round here, I a'pose?"
he remarked, interrogatively.
"Noâ not now," I replied. "I'm from
Chicago.
"Pretty big place, ain't it?" he con
tinued.
"Yes, it's a laree city." I said.
"I s'pose there's something goin' on
there mo^t of the time, ain't there?" he
asked. I nodded affirmatively.
"Well, we ain't so darned slow down
here, â  he added. "Had a dance in the
Hinckley Ridge schoolhouse last night
and there'll Le a turkey rnffle Tuesday."â

guilty of murder, and'the judges, after
dooming him to death, also decreed the
death penalty for his teaclier, saying that
he should have taught his pupil to respect
human life.

flis Great D'sire for Secrecy Led the
Groom to D-ny His
Identity.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,(
90S Broadway, Feb. 16. >
At the close of the Munhail revival
meeting to-night a young couple appeared
in the vestry, and a few minutes later Dr. j
Coyle had made them husband and wife, j
There was all the secrecy possible thrown j
around the affair by those moit interested, !
and it was stated by one of the bride's
friends that there will be some surprised
people to-morrow in San Francisco when
the story of the secret marriage is told.
This afternoon Franc Richardson, who ;
is the son of a San Francisco attorney
reputed to be quite wealthy, took out a '
marriage license to wed Miss Effie Cameron i
of East Oakland. Miss Cameron is well i
Known in this city on account ofhersud-i
den disappearance a year and a half ago. i
At that time, the young lady who was !
just turned 1(3, was left in charge of the :
home in East Oakland one day, and when
her mother returned Eftie was not to be
found. The case was reported to ihe :
j oiice, and nothing was heard lor several j
days of the missing girl.
She was eventually traced to San Fran
cisco, and when found at ihe home of Mr?.
Mary Dudley, on Point LoboÂ» avenue, she
refused to rÂ»turn. She declared that
sooner than return home she would co on
the stage and earn her living, as her
mother was unkind. After a few months,
however, she returned, but not until after
she bad n short theatrical experience.
There has been no announcement pf an
engagement, ana it was a great surprise to
her numerous acquaintances who atiendei
the revival to hear of the wedding.
Tne bridal party arrived at the First
.Presbyterian Church about half-past 8
o'clock, and as Rev. Dr. Coyle was on the |
platform they had to wait. As soon as !
the meeting was over he was told of the
state of affairs, and everyDody concerned
ndjournrd to the vestry.
Mr. Richar lson had no friend with him,
but M ss Cameron was eccompanied by
her mother and by her brother E wood j
and his wife. Mr*. Elwood Cameron was
formerly Miss Lottie Gunther, who at
tempted to conun.t suicide by taking j
roiion on her mother's jjrave some years j
ago.
Once inside the vestry there was no j
time last, and so anxious was Mr. Rich
ardson to keep ibe iiffair secret that he
denied his identity to one of tbe witnesses
of the marriage, even af er Dr. Coyle had
read the names from the iicense. The !
groom's age was given at 27 and that of
the bride as 18, but she looked girlish
enough for 16.
Sue was remarkably cool during the
ceremony, but th^ groom was not nearly ;
so much at his ea=e.
After the wedding the bridal party
boarded an electric car and went to East
Oakland.
The groom is a young man, well con
necied in San FranciÂ«co, and his great
desire to keep the marriage from t.eini;
made pub.ic and the absence of any of his
relatives gave rise to the belief that the
wedding is a secret one so far as he is con
cerned.
TWO EOADS HOLD OUT.

Railroad*.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 16.â William G.
Hensnaw is expected Irom the East
shortly, whither he went to try ana ob
tain support for the consolidation of the
street railroads of this city. The plan has
. been under consideration for some time,
and recently J. West Martin, president of
the Union Savings Bank-, of which Mr.
Hen^haw is vice-president, said that the
consolidation would in all probability be
effected if Air. Henshaw can obtain the
necessary money in the East for the pur
chase of the road.
While it Is probable that there may be
more exceptions, it is known that the
Hay wards Electric road and the Oakland
â¢and Alameda lines will not join the con
solidation. A. L. Stone, secretary of the
.Hay wards road, said to-night : "We cer
tnluly are not going into any combine.

Revival of Baseball.
OAKLAND, Cai... Feb. 16.â The recent
revival in baseball in this city has re
ceived added interest by the tact that the
Panes and the Hoese'mans of this city

old-time parades which were so famous in

Â»ays the la Waywaid.
OAKLAND, Cal, Feb. 16.â George A.
Douglass to-day tiled a suit for divorce
against his wife, but it is not sensational,
as was expected by many. He simply
charges waywardness as a cause of action.
Her escapades, he says, caused talk, and
the humiliation which he felt occasioned
mental anguish resulting in cruelty.
Mrs. Douzlas, it will be remembered,
recently visited San Jose and was followed
by her husband, who found her at a
masquerade â  ball. She is passionately
fond of shooting, hunting and all out
door sports.

and C. W. Pangburn corresponding sec
retary. It is the intention of the league,

members, to hold meetings the first and
third Tuesdays of each month.
During the past lew months interest in
the single-tax system has steadily
increased. The work in this city com
menced about eight years ago. and was
very active for a time. Well known sing'e
taxers, including Henry Geortre, Louis
Post, Ralph Hoy . Judge Maguire and
others, have lectured here under the
auspices of the league, and now that it
i has been re-organized, it is the irvomion
| of the oflice.rs to continue the series of
lectures and to avail themselves of the
presence of any noted single-taxers who
may be in this vicinity.
I're-ident Gregg, who po'.lei a large
vote two years ago as the labor candidate
for Lieutenant-Governor, is very enthusi
astic in the work of the league. "Al
though our work vr.s suspended -o far as
any propaganda effort was concerned, "
said the president to-day, "the oiginr.l
i league was never disbanded, and has
always l>een doing more or less woric in a
quiet manner. Now, however, so much
inicresi has been expressed in our work
that v was decided to reorganize and start
an active catii: aign on behalf of the prin
ciples of s nirle taxation.
"Our membership is increasing faÂ«Â«t, and
there are Hundreds who will join us as
so' nas they know that we have again
taken up active worlt. We are adopting a
new plan in regard to our meetines which
will certainly help to add to their interest.
In addition to a lecture eacli evening on
some diuinct phase of the single-tax ques
tion, we are also -iving a short musical
nnd literary programme, and it is being
wei, received."
Mr. Legget 's lecture to-night was de
vote I mainly to the leading principles of
single taxation. Several members of the
clul) assisted in the succeeding pro
gramme and many names were added to
me roll of the league.

EVERY ONE MAY
HONOR BURNS
His Monument Should Come
From the Entire
People.
Promoters cf the P an Wish It
to Be an Expression From
All Nationalities.
All Knw and Loved the Poet, and
All May Join to Hanor Him,
Says Colin B>yd.
The sub-committee of the Bnrns noonu
raent committee, which baa been author
ized to formulate a plan for a permanent
organization, held two meetings within
the past week.
Colin M. Boyti, chairman, and Y. C.
Lawson, secretary of the temporary or
aniza'ion, will be recommended as per
manent officers of the general committee.
The rules of order which will entail the
appointment of sub-committees involve
considerable consideration in order tnat
the entire machinery may be made to
run smoothly. The various programmes
by which the necessary funds may be
raised will also require considerable
thought at the hands of lu is committee.
"We intend to erect such a monument
in Golden Gate Park as will be a credit to
not only the Caledonian Clud, but the en
tire people of this State and City," said
Colin M. Bjyd yesterday. "It must be
borne in mind that this monument is
going to be placed in the people's park for
all time to come, and not lor a day or a
year. The memory of 'Robbie' Burns will
never die so long as the English language
is - piiketi, hence it is nothing strange or
wonderful that the Scotch people and their
descendants in this distant land of gold
and plenty should at this time make a
movement 10 snow their appreciation of
his genius. It will not be looked upon as
a clannish measure.
"To make it purely Scotch would be an
attempt to circumscribe the genius of
him who^e poems have become so dear to
the people.
"Considering th? magnitude of this
undertaking, the committee, of which I
have the honor to be the chairman, will
give all the details intrusted to it the
most carelul consideration. We want the
assistance and confidence oi the whole
people in this undertaking, so when we
are dead and gone our successors may
point with pride 10 :he monum nt in the
park which was erected under the au
spices of the Caledonian Cluo in 1900.
"Permit me to tay that we appreciate
the offer made to the monument commit
tee to accept a benefit in the Alcazar,
but :or the present we have not deeMed
upon any one plan for raising money."
The commit.cc on membership to which
D. li. McNeill, Andrew Wilkie and Colin
M. Boyd have oeen appon.ts.l, is also con
sidering the best means to obtain the co
operation of the best citizens, irrespective
of nationality, the object being, as ex
pressed by Mr. Mcrsab, to give the under
taking a broad and universal character.
it l- expe. t? 1 thai both o these sub-com
mittees will have a line of action formu
lated for the consideration of the monu
ment committee when this body meets
to-morrow eveninc.
DIDN'T HEAR THE BELL.
Evident Carelessness Results in
a Bad Streetcar
Accident.
F. H rmann and Companion Injured,
and a Buggy Smashed by an
Ellis-Street Car.
By the collision of an Ellis-street elec
tric car and a buggy and horse near Goueh
street yesterday morning, Frank Her
mann, collector for a downtown business
house, and a companion were pretty badly
jolted up. The former, it is believed, is
injured internally.
The grade at the bottom of which the
accident occurred is rather steep, and
even in fair weather gripmen find it diffi
cult to bring their cars to a halt within a
reasonable distance. In wet weather the
feat is almost impossible.
Hermann was driving his bnegy toward
Octavia. street when car 573, William
Shine conductor, wa* comin down the
sraile. Though the carbell was rung sev
erai times, Hermann did not seem to hear,
and when the collision occurred the
bugpy was overt!. rown and the two men
thrown out bodily. The horse managed
to retain its footing and rushed off with
the wreck of the vetiicle.
The injured men were taken to an ad
joining carp.Miter-shop and cared for pend
ing the arrival of a physician, who had
been hastily summoned. It is feared Her
mann has receiver internal injuries. His
companion, vtione name cou.d not be
lenrned, was bruised about the head and
shoulders, but was able to go home unas
â iitad.
In speaking of the matter to a passenger,
Conductor Shine said ample warning was
given Hermann to out of the way.
Every effort, he claimed, was made to stop
the car, but it could not be done in time.
IVY'S '97 GREETING.
An Enjoyable fr-ntertainment l>v a Chap
ter of the 1 <Â». .T.i Star.
The '97 greeting o( Ivy Cbapte*, Order
of the Eastern Star, given to its friends
last evening in Golden Gate Hall, was an
other of those delightful entertainments
for which this chapter is noted. They
are always so productive of genuine pleas
ure that the prospect of rain, as was
manifest early last evening, did not keep
away the large number who were invited.
The hall was crowded to its capacity with
those who assembled to listen to the sev
eral numbers to be presented.
Worthy Patron E. P. Morey acted as
master of ceremonies and announced as
the first number a recitation by Master
Lloyd Rowley. This was followed by a
piano solo by Mrs. D. M. Jackson. Mrs.
Alice "Waltz Bang a soprano so'o wiih
violin obligato by Miss Mabel Holbrook.
Miss C. Wetjen, a younp miss, gave a
whistling soio, rendering "'Javellena
Rusticana" with wonderful precision and
sweetness. Her style is very similar to
that of Mrs. Shaw, and it planned the au
dience so that she was forced to give an
encore. Mrs. Harry Clark, possessed of a
pure contralto voice, sang "Sweet
CASTORIA
For Infants and Children.
T5Â» hi- /7
linlli jx^Jfr //f/ ~ m Jen
\lolets " and she was followed by Miss
Wabei Holbrook, who gave a violin solo.
The entertainment concluded with a fame,
'The Matrimonial Advertisement," by
Misses Florence Raymond, Jeannette
Patridge and Jennie Williams, ami Messrs.
George Crandall and Frank Houpt. This
as well as the other numbers was meri
toriously and loudly applauded.
Then followed the disposition of a very
jpretiy painting presented by Charles S.
Tuton, the artist, and a lea:her sofa
cushion in burnt work, donated by Thomas
Lckwooa to the charter. The de*ifjn on
the cushion was odd, but an extraordinary
piece of that character of work. There
wasabo a grab bag in charge of Mrs. Cyrus
C. Dow, which wa- productive of much
amusement. The evening closed with a
dance in the lower hail.
The committee of arrangements were:
Mrs. J. J, Evans, Miss Jeanette PatrMce.
Miss Florence Raymond, E. P. Moiey,
worthy patron, and Frank Maxon. The
comraitiei? was ably assisted by Worthy
Matron Mrs. Jennie A. Uraves. The greet
ing was declared by all a great success.
SUNDAY CLOSING FIGHT.
The liquor Men Declare '1 hat the
Christian Endeavorerg Must Not
Be Ignored.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 16.â fight
over Sunday closing has now become
thoroughly organiz?d. The Christian En
deavorers have outlined their platform
and plan of campaign, and now the Oak
land Protective Association has issued
the following circular:
Dear Sir: At & regular meeting of the Oak
laud Proactive Association held on January
19, 1897, it was decided to give lair warning
to ail wholesale mid retail liquor dealers in
this city of the approaching danger threat
ened by the temperance fanatics and Christian
KnileÂ»yorers, who are thoroughly organized
and will make a stubborn and determined
1 fight from now until the Bih of March to close
up all the saloons in this city from 10 o'clock
p. M. Saturdays until 5 o'clock a. m. Mondays.
Now, if every one engaged in tha business
In this city will become a member of our as
sociation and pay into the treasury the sum
of $6 tor one year's dues, payable to the secre
tary immediately, the Slate association lias
agreed to fight this matter in our behalf to a
successful lermUation; but all dealers will
have to stand their share of the burden.
You will not be assessed tor any money dur
ins the year 1897, as the $6 dues from each
dealer w 11 be sufficient to pay all expenses.
If you value your business you will not hesi
tate, but go right to work. " By presenting a
united front and every one of us working for
the sustenance of our rights we will win out.
If, however, one-half of the dealers think the
other half should do the fighting and let
themselves off free our cause will be lost.

always led an indoor life. I have been a great sufferer from consti-
pation, and my liver has seemed to be out of order almost all the
time, and my face looked yellow. Some time ago a neighbor of
mine suggested that I try
Riparts Tabules
and I did so. I now take them whenever occasion arises, and
feel much better. My bowels act well, and people tell me my face
has taken on a more healthy look. I usually take one Tabule every
day and another at night before getting in bed."

Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
roan is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are tea
times worse than the mo-it severe pain. There
Is no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and under
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the"writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid In the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will tako
I the trouble to send bis name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I' say free I mean absolutely
without cost, bt-cause I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
I am not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
suffering the mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at enca could
they but get such a remedy as the one that
cured me. Do not try to study out how I can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mail the information, but send for it ana

that, although they cost nothing to got, ate

Sir: One of the proverbs reads: "A friend
loveth at all times, and a b;o:h'.-r is born for
adversity." We veterans love and fought for
freedom's flag. Every day we read oi such
cruelties to the oppressed of Cuba by that i
butcher Weyler we sincerely regret that most j
of us are physically incapacitated for duty in ;
the field. However, our sympathies are (or j
the Cubans in their struggle lor liberty. God- !
speed the Cuban League in its patriotic work.
It is gratifying to read the names of such
humanitarians and patriotic citizens for the j
Cuban committee as were published in this
morning's Call.
Perhaps in the near future you may hear
from us in a more substantial way. Yours, in
sympathy, Winfield Scott Morgan.

DANGEROUS LAUNDRIES.
Chinese Method of Spraying
Clothes Spreads Dis
ease.
â¢ *
Chairman Hart Will Introduce an
Ord:n2nci Forbidding the
Practice
Tne following report from Dr. Henry H.
Hart, chairman of the Committee on Bath
houses and Laundries, will be read before
the Board of Health to-day:
la conjunction with Inspector W. H. Tobin
for several days during the pust month 1 vis
ited a number of white and Chinese laundries.
In the former I found rapid progress being
made in sanitary improv ments in every de
partment, and fully $15,000 has been ix
pended, while In the Chinese laundries about
$5000 has been (-pent, thus proving conclu
sively the great necessity lor an inspector in
this branch of the Health Department.
In the Chinese laundries Improvements are
being slowly made, bat in spÂ»le of ail saniiury
measures danger from the spread of contagious
diseases Is apparent on account of the iilthy
habits of the inmates. Sleeping under the
work tables still continues; the use of their
patrons' clothes for bed iinen, pillows, etc., is
an everyday occurrence.
The dangerous mouth spray from consump
tive ana diseased Chinese flourishes as in the
past, and In this connec ion 1 will introduce
at this meeting an ordinance, to be submitted
to the Board of Supervisors, prohibiting under
severe penalty the spraying of the clothes with
the mouth.
1 find many laundries too small for the pur
t>oÂ«es for which they ere uited. the inmates
being crowded together like so many sardine?.
Opium denÂ« exist in lully two-thirds of the
60-called respectaÃle Chinese laundries in all
parts of ihe Citr, and whites of both sexes are
irequenters of the places, by day and night.
As stated before, having spent a number of
days during the past two months in visiting
ihe laundries in company with our inspector.
1 find that an assistant i- urgent. y needed, as
it is an utter impossibility for any inspector to
do just cc to the work alone. All portions of
the Ci y have to be viittd. and frequently
three or four visits are necessary to one
laundry in order to ascertain whether the re
quired work has been completed. Attendance
in court is a frequent occurrence, as a number
of arnsts nave b.-en made, and portions of the
City have not yet been iufpacted.
Nevertheless, great credit can be given to
Inspector To bin for the Â«b,e manner in which
he has handled the work of his department
during the three months of its existence, and
1 will suggest, under tne circumstances, that
an assistant bath and laundry inspector be
appointed to assist him in his duties.
1 do not believe that there is a department
of so great importance, next to our Pure Food
Bureau, by which disease can be prevented, as
in these laundries and bathhouses, which can
generate and spread disease broadcast, and It
i* unnecessary ! or me, in this limited space
to go into explanations. Respectfully sub
mitted, . He.vky H. Hart,
Chairman Committee on Bathhouses and
Laundries. *

TEOOP AS PLAN.
The Cavalrymen Aniima to Own Their
Own Horses.
The proposition of the unaitached com
pany, Troop A, N. G. C, to >ecuro a Jar.ne
site for the purpose of having mounted
druls, to which allusion has aircady been
made in The Call, now includes twenty
five horses to be used by the troop, which
liava t.een promised to the following
named gentlemen : John I'Â«rrott, Baron
yon Schro"de r , W. S. Ttvia, Frank BurKe,
Herbert C. Coil of Woodland, John F.
Boyd. Hir.tm Corey, X Sudden and J. D.
Carr of Salinas.
It is proposed to secure a site in the
â \Vestern Addition upon which to build an
armory and stables and have yard room in
whioh'to drill. If this can be secured Cap
tain Jenks proposes to make his company
ouu oi the best drilled in the State, and
with that idea in view it is proposed to se
cure Sergeant Moffatt of Troop B, Fourth
United States Cavalry, whose term of en
listment expires next month, as drill
fcer^eant.
To do what is proposed requires funds,
and as a way of securing them it is pro
posed to secure a number of honorary
member^ who will pay $50 each per year,
and by so doing avoid jury duty. Ten of
these wouid contribute $500, and that
added to the State allowance ami the
amount the members would contribute,
would, it is thoupht, provide a sufficient
sum to keep up the organization.
NAMES OF STREETS.
The Merchants' AxocUtioo Wants
Proper Signa on All Thoroughfares.
The Merchants' Association has for
wardei to Superintendent of Streets Am
brose the following letter relating to hav
ing the names of streets r laced on street
corners:
Dear Sir: Tne board of directors of thi> nÂ»<n
cintion has had under consideration the ques
tion of fctrect siÂ«ns on street corners oi the
City. The absence of n;ai:y signs was noticed,
and tho board employed a party fir two weeks
to examine the Co; ners of the streets ihroush
out tlic City. A carefu; rei>ort has bten pre
pared of tnose corners where street signs are
missing. A copy of this icport is herewith
sent to you. Tins list shows, in the first place,
those (street corners that have lamps but no
siens, anri secondly those street corners with
no lamps and no signs on the comers.
We tind that Order 1727 of thr iioard of Su
pervisors provides that 6treet si?ns Fhall be
erected and maintained at all street corners oi
the City. The owners x>i real estaie cornering
on the crossing and intersection of tne streets
are to bear the expense of maintaining these
strefi signs upon tne corners. Tne provisions
of theordercover ail cases and sectlou 3 makes
it the duty cf the Superin tendent oi Streets to
notify the owners oi all corner lots to comply
with the provisions of the order and eniorce
the same. Tne importance of having street
signs for the guidance of ihe residents of and
visi.ors to the City is apparent and we respect
fully request thai in so far as it may be within
the province of your office this ordinance
be enforced. Awaiting your kind repiy we
remain, very truly y>urs.

GREEKS WILL
MAKE READY
The Local Colony Is Very
Eager to Oppose the
Turks.
FUNDS WILL BE RAISED
TO HELP.
Patriotic Addresses to Be De
livered at a Banquet
Sunday.
THEIR LOVE OF CONFLICT Ib
INHERITED.
So Say Demetrak and Vamvcles,
Prominent Members of th;
H llenic Society.
Ti>e members of the local Greek colony
are wrought op to a high pitch of patri
otic enthusiasm by ihe news of the mother
country's expressed determination to
defy the unspeakable Turk and to draw
the sword il necessary in defense of cretaii
liberty. A- alieady stated in these col
umn?, ti.is enthusiasm has assumed a
practical form ; lunds are being raised to
succor the wives and families of the ma^
sacred Christians, and fully 2">o able
bodied Greeks are prepared to leave for
the scene of hostilities at almost a mo
ment's notice should the mother country
be actually in need of their services.
C. Demetrak of 1022 Mission street stated
last night that a banquet would be given
on Sunday evening in the Druids' Hall,
Sutler street, at the expense of A. Kosta,
tiie chairman of the committee recently
appointed by the Hellenic Mutual Benev
oltnt Society to consider the question of
raising funds on behalf oi the Cretan
patriots. The banquet proper will le
preceded by a mass- meeting, in tbeconroe
of winch Messrs. Demetrak, M. I). \*am
vules, M. Daminnakis and F. Yrewioswill
de.iver addresses on t lie subject of the
present crisis and invite suggestions from
i lie rest of their countrymen in this City,
who are expected to attend the meeting
almost to a man.
It was also decided the other evening to
give a ball for the benefit of the sufferers
on the island of Crete, at the Turn
Verein Hall, SS-> Turk street, on the 27th
inst., particulars of which will be pub
lished iater. Every guest will appear in
the Greek national costume, and a large
gathering is confidently anticipated.
"All the Greeks in tne City," said Mr.
Demetrak, "are very enthusiastic, and the
Cretan question ab orbs our attention just
now. \\ c are preparing to assist our coun
try in every way possible, eilher with men
or with money. If Greece has to light
Turkey, there are many oi us, not only in
fcan Francisco, but all over the States,
who will go over to help her. Most of us
are naturalized Americans, and love our
adopted country, and are equally ready to
draw the sword on her behalf when called
upon. Just now, however, the United
Slates enjoys peace and can spare us to
right for the niothercountry. 1 believe we
can raise a company of 250 able-bodied
men, fully equipped, to leave at a mo
ment's notice when needed. It is a nat
ural instinct with the Greeks to aid the
distressed, as was illustrated last week,
when our society contributed a large sum
for the benefit of the sufferers by the re
cent floods at Athens. To-day's news
jrom the seat of war was received with joy
among us, and we have been holding an
impromptu celebration in honor of the
event."
M. D. Vamvales echoed the sentiments
of Mr. Demetrak, when interviewed yes
terday.
"Yes," he said, "all in in readiness when
the struggle really begins between Greece
and Turkey. There are probably about
600 Greeks in San Francisco, and 1000 on
the facific Coast. At least 100 in this City
alone are qualified to tight when called
upon. It should be borne in mind that
nearly ail of us have served our time in
the Greek army, with the exception of
thoÃe who left home before they were of
age, and some others who were born in
this country. At present we are merely
concerning ourselves with the raising of
funds to assist the cause of Crete, and we
give a ballon the 27>b inst. for the bene
fit of the widows and children of the ma-
sacred Cretans. Nevertheless we are pre
pared to form a company more than 100
strong to leave for Crete when called upon.
Many of the Greeks here are fairly
wealthy, and we shall have no difficulty
in raising pienty of money."
Vamvales is a' big, pow-rlully built man,
and physically, at least, seems admirably
qualified to undertake a warlike mission.
The love of fighting for its own sake, he
explained, was a national inheritance,
dating from Thermopylae. Salamis and a
hundred other blood-stained fields upon
which his ancstors have vindicated the
cause of freedom against the incursions of
Asiatic tyranny. "â¢Wherever there is any
fighting," said Vamvales naively, "we
must be in it. We would help the United
States with equal readiness against a for
eign foe."
TUGGERS WILL TRAVEL.
An Advertising Scheme to At
tract Attention to Califor
nia Products.
Cars to Be Chartered to Carry Ov r
the Country a Display of Cereals,
F: uits and Muscle.
The big international tug-of- war tourna
ment, which is to take place in the Me
chanics' Pavilion from the 27th of Feb
ruary to the 9th of March, is merely a pre
liminary step to a big scheme for adver
tising the State.
D. R. McNeill, the lessee of Central
Park, who will manage the tournament,
intends to select a champion team from
among the competitive ten teams, which
Jater in the year he will send on a trip all
over this country and finally land them in
Piirisatthe great World's Exposition of
1900. They will b* called the "California
(Hants," and McNeill is confident they
will be able to ompull any team that can
be brought against them ai ihÂ«t show,
which is to surpass all the expositions
heretofore given.
It is expected that these California
giants will be a wonderful advertisement
for the State. The plan is to charter an
engine and fourteen cars and take along
with the giants a superb collection of Cali
fornia products, 'ihere will be an im
mense tent of red, wuite and blue canvas,
under which these products will be dis
played, with admission free. After the
free show there will be tug-of-war con
tests, to which admission will be charged
to pay the expenses of the big traveling
advertisement.
Advance agents will precede the show a
cw months to get up tug-of-war tourna
ments to determine the best teams to put
up against the Culifornians and compete
for large prizes. The combination of
champion athletic features with the dis
play of fruits, wines and other products,
it is believed will draw a great deal of at
tention to this State.
At the various training quarters in the
City the teams are industriously training
for the coming; contest. In some places
the rope is attached to a scale to test the
increase of pulling force, and in others it
is attached to a very heavy weight, which
the men hold suspended a long time in the
air to develop endurance.
The Swedish team, which is the cham
pion at the present time, is in fine condi
tion. The men average 200 pounds each
of solid bone and muscle.

perjury.

Hellman on December 24, 1894. swore be

JOE KING AS A WITNESS.
Asked to Explain Why the H s
p lal Work Was Not Let
by Contract.
The Mayor Will Be Asked to Abro
gate Morgan & Co.'s Mission
H:gh School Contract.
Ex-Supervisor Joe King was the star
witness before the Grand Jury yesterday
afternoon. The jury wanted to know
from him how it was that the $10,000 ap
propriated for repairs at the City and
County Hospital by the last Board of Sup
ervisors was frittered away without any
thing being accomplished commensurate
with that sum of money. King was chair
man of the Hospital Committee. The
work that ate up the $10,000 was done In
small jobs, such as did not require to be
submitted to the competition of bidders
under the law. It therefore could be j:iven
to anybody selected by the committee of
the board, and it so happened fiat they
were King's friends who were selected in
most instances to do the work.
The jury wanted to know why the work
was not done regularly by contract. King
was a good witness in his own behalf.
That is to say his explanations left the
jury as much in doubt as it was before,
cieveral of the contractors were also before
the jury, but their testimony was to the
effect that they did the work that they
were required to do. The investigation,
however, is still on, and will be followed
to its furthest limit.
The committee having in charge the
special investigation of the Mission High
School contract scandal has prepared a
â eport which it will submit to Mayor
Phelan to-day. The report reviews the
evidence taken before the jury, as well as
the investigations of the committee, an 1

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1897.
WAS SHOT DOWN
IN HIS SALOON
Patrick Dolan the Victim
of a Man He Knows as
" Barney."
The Assailant Says He Was
Avenging an Attempt to
Poison Him.
Eugene K?nn-y Has Surrendered Him
self to the Police as the Man Who
I; Wanted.
With bullet holes through his body and
life's blood oozing from him; knowing
full well that his hours were numbered,
Patrick Dolan wept on the operating table
of the Receiving Hospital yesterday morn
ing and niaue his dying statement.
This bit of ante-mortem history is part
of the evidence relied upon by the police
to convict Eticene Kenney, better known
as "Barney, the Cook," of one of the most
cold-blooded murders committed! here
since David Fauss calmly entered, a
Fourth-street saloon about ninety days
auo and emptied his revolver into the
body of Billy Manning, who was quietly
enjoying a game of cards.
Fauss walked out of the place where
twenty people had seen him assassinate
his man, and he has never been seen since
by any one authorized or inclined to take
him into custody. Like Blanther and
Dunham, hÂ« is null at large, and Eugene
Kenney might still be among the un
captured bad he not felt some unac
countable compunction and delivered
himself to the deteci ives.
Patrick Dolan, the proprietor of a saloon
at 1^74 Market street, within a stone'.s
throw of the City Prison, took his regular
morning watch yesterday. There were no
people in the hou-e, excepting old Thomas
Urowe, a hanger-on, who was so besotted
and asleep that he did not bear the report
of three pistol shots. The detectives cap
tured him wben they arrived upon the
of the shooting, and upon compar
ing notes they acreed th -y each knew as
little as did the others about the affair.
Crowe, however, was captured and is
now in prison.
The first evidence obtained came from
Patrick Dolan himself, after he had been
brought from the yard bock <>f hiÂ« saloon
and hi* wounds had been examined at the
hospital. He said :
My name is l'n trick Dolan. I am proprietor
oft c saloon 1374 Market street. I was born
in Ireland, am unmarried and have residei in
this City ft teen years. A man by the name of
Barney came inio the saloon and asked for
beer. 1 went to draw it and ne just shot me.
I never had any trouble with him before. He
did not say anything to me except when I
asked him if he wanted beer. I was walking
up to the kegs when he tired at me and I ran
out the back way and said I was shot. He ran
out the front door. There were two other men
In the saloon. Tom Crowe, a jin'tor In the
City Hall, was one. I doa't know the other
man. The man who shot me his name is
Barney. 1 don't know his other name.
Believing I am about to die, I In-ruby make
this mv last dying statement and dec. are the
same to be the tru:h.
(Signed) I'atkkk Dolan, 720 Tehama,
The statement was witnessed by O. H.
Heyneman and A. A. Maguire, M.D.
"Barney" it a well-known character
around the saloons near the City Hail,
and he has been kimwii for years us
"Barney, the Cook." He made a living
by doing chores in and about these p:aces
at odd umÂ«*s.
George Young, a window-washer, work
ing across the street near Central Park,
heard the three shos tha: were tired and
saw two men dart out of the door of the
saloon and separate. One went toward
Seventh and the other toward Eighth
street.
Charles Lamb, a passer-by, likevthe
observed the fleeing men, but was not in
clined to atop either. Hundreds cf other*
on the s :eet heard the flidis, but walked
away, leaving the two fugitives to go un
ai rested.
There vas nothing, therefore, upon
which a clew could fie fabtt-ne 1 excepting
the dying statement of Patrick Doian,
that it was "Barney" who dio the shoot
in ir.
The Dolan saloon is a "beer joint," as
such places are commonly called. It has
an opening on Market and reaches back to
another on Park avenue. The bar proper
occupies the west side of tbe saloon to a
row of beerkegs. There are numberless
tables, billiard and other kinds, in the
back.
A broken "steam-beer" glass, found on
the floor of the saloon, corroborates Do
lan's dyini: statement that he was draw
ing the beverage for his patron when he
was shot.
There appeared, ho tar as the police
could ascertain at the time, to be no mo
tive for the shooting.
The builets entered on the right side,
I about tbe prom and a little higher up, one
puncturing the right lung.
Dolan has been a member of Court Inde
, penrience of f c Foresters o: America for
j many years and many of his fraternal
confreres called upon him yesterday after
noon. They wtre not permitted to see
him, his condition being such that tospeak
simply meant death.
Kenny surrendered himself at the Cali
fornia-street station to Lieutenant Esola,
shortly after 5 o'clock, acknowledging
that he had Hhot Dolan. When searched
two Smith & Wesson revolvers were found
in his Dockets, and one had three cham
bers empty.
He was sent to the Receiving Hospital,
where Dolan identified him as the man
who shot him, and was then taken to the
City Prison, where he was booked on the
charge of assault to murder.
Last night Kenny made the following
statement to Captain Lees:
The reason why I shot Dolan was on account
ol v poisoning attair In 1891. Mehan and the
two Dolan brothers tried 10 poison me. They I
had some stuff they put in my beer. This was |
some ttme in June, July and August of 1891.
1 was cooking at 10 Sacramento street, and
lat Metmn was the waiter. Dolan made the
stuff for Mehan, and he was to rut it in the
beer. I got so stupid from the stuff thnt 1 left
town. I went away in tie lull of 1891, and
went to Denver, where I cooked. From D n
ver I went to Washington. 1 was in Denver
four months. Then I went to Butte City,
Mont., cooking in a niiuere' boarding-house
for three months. Than I went to Spokane
tor a couple of weeks. Then I worked on a
tunnel on the Noitheru Pacific Rail
road, in the mountains. I worked there two
years in the drift. I have been in this City
lor the past two years last November. I have
been working on and off In the various restau
rants; worked at 50 T.iir.i street for two or
three months past. I have worked at 419
Kearny street and 410 Kearny street, cooking.
This morning I smarted out to get juuslaeuuu
lor the poisoning in 1891. ! want to give you
'.h-i straight Btory. I have not seen him for
quite a while, for almost live months. I never
spoue to him about the poisoning. Ho wanted
to beg my pardon some time ago for poisoning
me, but I would not accept it. I went to the
saloon to settle up a grudge I had against
Dolan. When I went in Dolan bowed to me
and I bowed to him. He asked roe what 1
wanted and I said I wanted a glass of bier and I
he went to draw a gluss when 1 opened fire at j
him. I lired three shots at him. I bought |
two pistolsâ one yestenia? morning and one
tr.is morning â paving $3 for each. 1 intended
one to do the same thing io Mellon With if I 1
sitw him. I spent nearly all my money for the
pistols. I bought them and trie ammunition
at an auction place on Kearny street, between
Sacramento and California.
My right name is Kugene Kenny; they
call in*. Barney in order to reflect upon me. ,
Barney is a sort ot a nickname. 1 whs born in I
Ireland, in the county of Gal way. I have I
been in America since 1888. I cume direct to I
New York and then to ban Francisco, i was ,
in New York nearly two yeais. then came out
here. lam not married and have no f*m:iy.
1 have a cold and the grip, and have been
twice to Dr. Bazet at the I'helan building, i
The doctor gave me some medicine. I sleep
very wellâ ten or twelve hours a night If 1
want to.
Alter the shooting I went up Market street
to Eighth, down Eighth to Mission, to my
homo at 13 Anthony street. Mrs. Welch keeps
the house. I have been there since last June, j
I remained there for about twenty minutes, I
then went back to Market, down Kearny to j
California, where 1 met one of Morse's men, j
and to.d him 1 shot Do tin, and he told me to I
give myself up at the California-street station,
'lhen I had something to eat on Sacramento j
street, beiow Kearny, and remained there I
about twenty minutes. Then I came up to
Kearny and California streets and read the
papers, and then went down to the California- j
street station find gave niyse f up to the ser
geant in charge. I told him 1 wanted to give i
myself up; that I was the man who shot Dolan. |
I feel as though 1 wrs justified in what I did.
The fact that 1 was beini.' poisoned is known
to many of your south-of-Market-street police
officer*. The poisoning Is what made me
uave here. My Christian name is Owen, but
1 have alwnys called myself Eugene in this
country. I belong to no church, although my
parents are Catholics. I still feel the same r -
sentment against Mehan. I know the Dolan j
boys pretty well to my sorrow. I did not
know tnem in Ireland. I'at Mehan introduced !
me to them. I met Mehan at 1O Third street
where I was cooking and he waited on the
table. We, Mehan and 1, were always good
riends and I spent my money with him. He
;s not a married mnn. We never quarreled
and were tho best ot friends.
There is something at the bottom of this,
but 1 do not want to make the statement new. â 
I don't want to implicate certain people yet, j
the story will come out later. I am 35 years!
of Age. There was a woman in it but she was j
n good woman. Dolan knew me when 1 saw |
him in the Receiving Hospital; he identified
me as tho man who shot him and I don't deny I
it. The Dolans and Mehan were poison- j
Ing me. The poison got to my brain and in
my system and affected my head. My brother
wrote me about the poisoning matter from
EUGENE KENNEY\
New York. My cousin, Pat Smith, left the
<ity nnd told my brother in Now York about
it and wrot--' to me. L>olan b?pgtvl mv pardon
in 1891 and he wanted me to May in town.
They lold me they had been poUoning me;
they acknowledged that the' were ooing it..
Dolnn wanted to give me fUOO, but I would
not. accept it. Ido not want to say now what
their object was in poisoning me, that will
come out later.
Kenny does not appear to be all right
mentally at times, particularly when
tali;inc about the attempts to po son him.
He was employed up to Monday morning
in Healey's res'aurant, 60 Third street, as
second cook. He was discharged that
niorning because he was inclined to be
rude to patrons. Beyond that he seemed
to be all right mentally. He does not ap
pear to bo in the least concerned over his
c:ime.

AN X RAY ON
ROAD LAWS
Supervisor Ayer Makes
Some Drastic Crit
icisms.
Santa C : ara County, He Declares,
Wishes No State Inter
meddling.
Throwing Two-Thirds of the Taxation
on Incorporated Cities Termed
Unjust.
About a week ago the Assembly Com
mittee on Roads and Highways held a
meeting to consider the bills providing
for a State and county system of public
roads and highways, to be built at the ex
pense of the State at large and according
to the most scientific methods of modern
road building. Several provisions in the
j original bills were objected to for various
| reasons and it was proposed to reduce the
I number of Commissioners from three to
one. A fi^ht was also made to allow Su-
I pervisora to have some voice in the build
ing of roads within their own counties
and in extending money for the same.
It was also pointed out as a fatal objec
j tion against the original bills that it
, would require twenty years to build all
! the road> projected in the State; that con-
I sequently some counties wouid be obliged
to pay the tax of 2}Â£ cents on eacu $100
for ten or fifteen years before the work of
road-building would be begun at al!, and
\ that two-thirds the burden of taxation
would fall on the incorporated cities ana
town?, which would not receive by any
means the commensurate advantage.
S. 1". Ayer, one of Santa Clara County's
best-known and most popular Super
j visor.-, is now in this City intending to
busine s affairs. Mr. Ayer has been a
! Supervisor of Santa Clara County since
j 1876, with the exception of two years.
During that time he has made the im
| provement of public highways a special
i study, arid as one who is firmly opposed
! to taking the improvement and mainte
i nance of public highways out of county
I jurisdiction his opinions are of especial
j interest. In discussing the matter yester
| day he said:
"It is contemplated by the State Bureau
of Highways that about 4000 miles of road
in the Slate-, of California, running from
Si-kiyou to San Diego, shall be declared
State roads, and the money for the main
tenance and improvement of those roads
is to be raised by a general State tax.
i Heretofore incorporated towns and cities
j which have a system of their own have
been exempt from county road taxes.
"This bill, however, provides that they
shall pay a regular State tax. For
j instance, San Francisco would pay at least
one-third the expense of building the
I roads, and the annual tax on this City
I would amount to about $140,000, and the
j incorporated cities, taken as a wnole,
i would pay about two-thirds of the tax.
"It is a question whether it wouid be a
| wise policy to take the management of
j the roads out of the jurisdiction of the
: co'inties and vest it in a State Bureau of
! Highways, to be managed by the Governor,
or have them managed and improved by
the different counties, as at present. One
thing is certain â it isawell-known fact that
the incorporated citip?, 'except a few which
have been highly improved, possess roads
not in vpry good condition.
"In IS7(> the roads oor. r Santa Clara County
were Dot in very good condition either,
when Lick mad* the proposition to build
the obseivatory on Mount Hamilton, pro
vided good roads could and would be built
to it. The Supervisors gladly atcepted his
proposition, but first they found they
would have fo go to the Legislature and
have a road law passed enabling them to
ro to the expense of building those roads.
Under the old constitution each county
cor.M have a road law of its own.
"While we were at it we concluded to im
prove pII our roads. Then we formed a
system of watering them. The result 1?
that we have over 3000 miles of well
w-uered and traveled roads, and they are
in as pood condition in winter as in sum
mer. Our main thoroughfare!!, north,
east, south and west, are, as I said, welJ
watered and traveled, and the people of
our county have paid for it. .The result-,
attained warrant tnern in feeling proud
over the expenditure. Winter or sum
mer, it makes no difference, heavy loads
can be hauled at one time as well as at
another. And every county in this State
could have avaiied itself of the same privi
lege.
"Under the new constitution, when the
road law had to be general, the State
adopted a law very similar to the Santa
Clara â¢ road law which that county had
under the old constitution. Of course we
think that we are able and competent to

manage our own roads. We do not ask
for any bureau of highways, or any com
missioner, or anything of that kind, and
if they will only not interfere with us or
mutilate our system we can maintain our
system of good roads in the future as we
have in the past.
"The levy of 2Jj cents over 4000 miles of
roads is an absurd proposition. AVhy, it
would take forty years to perfect such a
system. I believe in a system that the
present generation can get some good out
of, and I do not see how it is that the
Governor of this State can appoint three
men to run a road system better than the
counties can by electing their own men.
If appointed they would be only human
beiDgs â not necessarily have wings. I
think it could be made one of the greatest
political machines in the State of Cali
lornia, because they could have their own
men In every precinct, with over $300,000
behind them to spend.
"Moreover, the Legislature can put the
same restrictions on the Boards of Super
visors that it can put on the Bureau of
Highways, and can compel the different !
boards to maintain i pod highways in
their respective ccuntie.?. The sum of
$300,000 scattered over 40G0 miles of road i
would not amount to anything at all. As I
I understand the bill no county can have j
to exceed the sum of $15,000 in any one '
year. That would not so much as sprinkle
our 100 miles of road, which they propose
to make State road.
"If the incorporated cities feel like pay
ing a road tax they had better spend it on
themselves. They need it about as bad as
anywhere. Three men in the State Bureau
of Highways have in two years spent
about $30,000. If they had employes in
the same proportion to the 4000 miles of
road it does not seem to me as if the ap
propriation would nay their.salaries alone.
"I want it to be understood that I am in
full accord with the wheelmen. Ido not
want to discourage good roads in any way
or shape, and when wheelmen want
to have races you will notice that in most
cases they come down to Santa Clara
County to make their records. I am op
posed, however, to any system that tukes
the care of the roads away from the coun
ties'. To my belief the counties are able to
and should maintain their own system of
reads.
"There is another matter closely con
nected with the question of good roads
that should come in for the careful
thought of all those who taKe an interest
in the welfare of the State. Two years
ago a bill came before the Legislature to
build a rock crusher at Folsom. The
counties of Sacramento, San Joaquin and
Yuba were very much in ravor of it. I
was liberal enough tÂ» help the matter
along by using what influence I possessed
to have the crusher put in. It was done
at un expense of $ jO.OOO.
"Lt has now been in operation about
two years, and I understand that none of
the counties named have availed them
selves ot the pr.vilege of using the crusher
on their roads. This crusher may be a
good thing for the counties near FoJsom,
but it is of no earthly use to those far
away. The fieifjhtace of taking it around
to the different counties is too great.
When the other counties wish to have any
ock-crushing done they have to start
crushers of their own.
"In conclusion, let me state that if the
incorporated cities of this Staie want to
contribuie $200,000 to the improvement of
the various roads of the State they had
better do it tdrough their respective
boards of Supervisors and not through
any commissioner, and if San Francisco
feels like contributing $140,000 a year
toward road buiUing she ou^ht to have
>ome say as to how- thine* are done."

A Queer Suit for Damages Against Man
ager Be.asco.
Manager Belasco of the Alcazar was sued
in the Justice's Court yesterday by Arthur
Sears and his sister, Mrs. Nellie E. Cov
ington. The lady wauls $299 99 and Mr.
Bears wants $240.
The complaint alleges that the plaintiffs
are suffering from great mental pain and
anguish because they are not actors, ac
knowledged as such by the world.
The complaint sets forth that Belasco
conducts a school of acting; that he agreed
to make his pupils first-class actors within
six months, so that even old managers
could not tell that they were aruateiirs.
Sears alleces that when the second install
ment of $f.O fell due he was iar from being
an actor of such caliber that professionals
would not know him from an amateur,
for which reason he greatly suffered and
was chagrined in the presence of his
friends. He concludes by alleging that
BeJasco's instructions have done him no
good.
Speaking of the matter last night Mr,
Belascosaid: "I know these people very
well, and they have some talent, but the
young man never knew his lines, and did
not pay his tuition in full. He is a house
painter and a member of the guards. He
used to say the soldiers were in his way so
ranch that he could not study; that they
held their socials at his home. The suit
is laughable and the claim ridiculous.
Everybody knows that actors cannot be
made in a few months, and that no
teacher can guarantee such things as
these complainants claim. Their suit 3
are huge jokes."

Doctors are often handicapped by tha
mere fact that when treating the diseases of
women, they suggest and insist on "exam-
inations" and '" local treatment." A great
many of them do not know that this is abso-
lutely unnecessary. Many a woman has
been thrown into a dangerous state of ner-
vous excitement by the mere suggestion of
such treatment. Many women lie to the
doctor. That sounds hard, but it is un-
doubtedly true. The}' know that if they
admit certain symptoms that the doctor
will inevitably insist on an 'â examination.'
They do not "give him all the facts in the
case, and so he works in the dark. Quite
often the doctor is too busy and too hurried
to make the necessary effort to obtain the
facts. He frequently treats symptoms for
what they appear to be on the surface, when
the real cause and the real sickness is deeper
and more dangerous. A derangement of
the distinctly feminine organs will derange
the whole body. The woman herself may
not know exactly what is the matter with
her, but whenever she is sick, there are two
things she should look out for first. One is
what is called "female weakness;" the
other is constipation, for these two things
frequently go together. Dr. Pierces Fa-
vorite Prescription is designed for the cure
of diseases and disorders of women, and it
