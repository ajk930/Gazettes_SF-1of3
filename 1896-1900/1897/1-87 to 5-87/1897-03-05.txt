VOLUME LXXXI.-NO. 95.
WASHINGTON, D. OL, March 4.â William McKinley of Ohio,
at twenty-seven minutes past 1 o'clock to-day, succeeded
Grover Cleveland as President of the United States, when
he was sworn to preserve, protect and defend the constitu
tion. Before an assemblage of fellow-citizens as representative of
Amerjcan manhood and womanhood as greeted any previous chief
magistrate, and as great in numbers as the accommodations would
permit, the fourth son of the State of Ohio to occupy the high office
became the head of a nation of 70,000,000 people.
The day broke bright, clear and crisp. The memory of the last two
inauguration days was sufficient to cause worry to anybody, which
Boon passed. There have been inaugural days that have come down
from generations past as wonderfully beautiful with regard to weather
condition*. Such days have been in the minority, for March is not the
pleasantest month in the year, even in balmy Washineton.
This mornine a few clouds were in the sky, but they were clouds of a
sort that precurse nothing disagreeable. The newsboys were the nrat to
â¢ waken the town into activity, and they were soon augmented by the
badge fakers, selling gold-bug badges, and the gilt-capped men who sold
official programmes. Between 6 and 7 o'clock, however, the streets and
avenues in the central part of the city became alive with human activity.
Enterprising excursionists who arrived late yesterday or in the early
â¢ours of the morning, and who feared for thoir chances of viewing the
â¢â¢iite House, wandered through the grounds surrounding the historic
diansiou belore the sun was well above the horizon.
By 9 o'clock the sun came out full and slcong and served to temper
the slight chill of the atmosphere. Pennsylvania avenue was, of course,
the center resort of the early sightseers. They walked along the broad
pavements congratulating themselves and acquaintances on the perfect
day that had been given for the occasion. It was just cool enough to make
a light overcoat comfortable. It was after 8 o'ciocit before the first blare
Â©f trumpets reminded the people that the miltary parade would shortly
McKINLEY INAUGURATED PRESIDENT.
The San Francisco Call
assemble. By 9 o'clock the avenue, as the broad highway is best known,
was pretty well crowded.
People had begun to take positions along the curbs and to bank np at
particular points of vantage. In the vicinity o! the White House and the
Ebbkt House the crowds soon grew to large numbers. Bands playing
lively aira followed the bodies of troops, the latter to take part in the
parade, as they marched to the proper positions in the line. The regular
troops, whic i were to form the escort of the President and President-elect
from the White House to the Capitol, formed the principal attraction for
the sightseer* strung alone the avenue irom the White House toward the
Canitol building. They marched along with a swinging step that struck
the admiration of tiie spectators, and frequent applause marked the
passage of each body to its assigned position.
At 10 o'clock streetcars crossing the line of march were stopped by
the police, and wire ropes that blocked passage along tne thoroughfare
over which the procession passed were stretched across the side streets so
that vehicles and other spectators were prevented from going beyond the
curbs.
The White House grounds were closed early in the morning to all ex
cept those entitled by ticket or otherwise to admission there. People who
had green slips of cardboard thtit gave entrance to the reviewing stand
began coming early, satisfied to sit for many hours in anticipation of the
military show which would end the inaugural ceremonies proper. Mrs.
Cleveland had a number of callers during the morning, including the
ladies composing the Cabinet circle and a few intimate friends.
The members of the Cabinet assembled early in the Cabinet-room and
sat for the last time around the long table at which their conferences had
been held. Pr^^ent Cleveland meanwhile was in the private part of the
house busily /^pecting and acting on batches of Congressional bills that
were being < Jivered at intervals by messengers from tne Capitol. Mr.
Cleveland felt decidedly better of his rheumatic attack, but did noc take
any chances, and reste i the troublesome right foot on a chair as he pro
ceeded with his last official work.
At the Ebbitt House the President-oUct wÂ»9 preparing tor too dÂ»y,
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, MARCH 5, 1897.
At 8 o'clock he sat down to breakfast with a better appetite than he has
had at any time since his recent illness. Mrs. McKinley took breakfast
in her apartments. At 10 o'clock Senator Sherman and Senator Mitchell
of Wisconsin, the committee irom the Senate of the United States ap
pointed to escort the President-elect from his hotel to the White House,
were ushered into Major McKinley 's room. At ten minutea pa3t 10 Sena
or Sherman said: "I think it is time to start if you are ready, Mr. Presi
dent."
Senator Sherman and Major McKinJey set out. They were followed
by Senator Mitchell, Abner McKinley, Secretary Porter aud Captain H.
O. Heistand. The President-elect entered his carriage amid cheers.
Senator Sherman sat beside h** and Senator Mitchell and Mr. Dougherty
opposite him. Thus they were driven to the White House. A cheer
from the crowd gathered around the east entrance to the White House
ctrounds gave voice to those in waiting in the big mansion that tbe Pres
ident-elect was approaching.
Troop A of Cleveland, the personal escort of Major McKinley, led the
way up the broad asphalted driveway, their arms and accoutrements
sparkling in the sun. They presented a handsome appearance. Every
man except the bugler, whose animal was purposely in contrast with
those of his comrades, rode a mettlesome black horse. A call from tbe
bugler sent tee troop in colnmns of fours to the right of the portico covering
the carriage entrance, and another call brought men and animals into a
long line facing the entrance to the mansion. Senator Sherman's car
riage, drawn by two horses, was guided skillfully up to the steps leading
to the main door. Major McKinley, looking fresh, vigorous and well
dressed, jumped out briskly, followed by Senator Sherman and Senator
Mitchell.
Major McKinley walked across the portico and through the entranc e
to his future home with an easy, dignified swine The tall form of his
Secretary of Slate towered above him at his side, while Senator Mitchell
brought up the rear. The White House employes, formed in line across
the public lobby, bowed as Major McKinley passed them. The big doors
separating the public from the private part of the house were thiowa
wide open, and through these Major McKinley walked, taking off his bat
as he crossed the threshold. It was then 10:20 o'clock.
Vice-President-elect Hob.irt left the Arlington at 10:30 o'clock: With
Senator Elkins of West Virp.nia he entered a carriage at the private en
trance. There was a large crowd to see the Vice-President make his first
start on a journey of four years of public life at the National capital. The
windows of the hot-1 were crowded with ladies. Drawn up on the plaza
in front of the ho:el was the Essex troop of Newark, N. J., to escort Mr.
Hobart to the Capitol. When Mr. Hobart appeared at the entrance ha
was greeted with prolonged cheers. He graceluly acknowledged the
salute by raising hip hat. The troop catne to salute and at the command
of "right about" the procession turned the corner, and by a round-about
way went to the Capitol.
When Major McKinley and the two Senators entered the oval-shaped
blueroom nobody was there to receive them. President Cleveland was
busily engaged upstairs putting his signature to bills and joint resolu
tions. Meanwhile, members of the Cabinet walked in to greet the incom
ing executive, ami there was a pleasant exchange of courtesies. But the
wait was much longer than anybody expected. It was exactly half an
hour after the President-elect entered the blueroom before Mr. Cleveland
came downstairs to greet him. They spent a minute or two only in con
ventionalities, and then word wa3 given to General Howe of the armyi
aid to the grand marshal, that they were ready to start for the Capitol.
It was a dignified procession that walked from the blueroom to the
carriage waiting under tho portico. The approach of the Presidential
party to the Capitol building was made through a vast concourse of
people, and the appearance of the retiring and the incoming Chief Execu
tive was announced by vociferous cheers that were heard distinctly
within the walls of the Senato c ambers. The elevators of the Senate
wing, which had been shut down in order to better handle the crowds,
were pressed into service for Mrs. McKinley, who arrived ahead of her
husband. She repaired to an adjacent committee-room for a short rest
before taking her seat in the gallery, which, owing to the enormous crowd
that bad been forced into the chamber, was suffocatingly hot.
The Presidential party walked up the main steps of the entrance to taÂ«
PRICE FIVE CENTS.2
Senate through tbe bronze doors. The
ascent was evidently burdensome to Mr.
Cleveland. When lie reached the top of
the stairs he wus puffing considerably and
only recovered from ihe exertion when he
had taken a short rest in the President's
room. Mr. McKinley walked briskly, but
measured Ins tread to correspond with
that of his distinguished companion. He
was accompanied to the room of the Vice-
President by Senator Sherman of the
committee on arrangements and tiÂ»e com
ing Premier of the administration.
Vice-President-elect Hobart and Sena
tor E. kins received Mr. McKinley. The
first question Mr. McKinley asked as he
stepped into the room was as to whether
Mrs. McKinley had safely reached the
Capitol and been taken care o'. Assured
that this hud been done the President
elect sat down for a short rest, during
which he chatted with Senators Sherman
and E.kins and General Porter. General
Miles, commanding the army, and aid
and Admiral Browne of the navy and aid,
and Russell B. Harrison of tbe staff of
General Porter accompanied the President
to the Senate corridor.
It was eighteen minutes after noon
when President-elect McKinley, with
Senator Sherman, walked to the Presi
dent's room and joined the retiring Presi
dent. Headed by the assistant sergeant
at-arms, Senators Sherman and Mitchell
oreceded and escorted Mr. Cleveland and
Mr. McKinley to the main entrance to the
Senate.
From the moment the White House
was left until these two distinguished
citizens took their seats on the floor of the
Senate, after being announced by the as
â¢ sistant doorkeeper, they were accom
panied by three picked men from the
Secret Service Department. These men
remained by the doorway and followed
the President and President-elect to the
platform and remained near by through
out the proceedings. Major-General Mile?,
the commanding officer of the army ; Ad
miral, Browne, the ranking officer of the
navy, v.ith their aidsâ Captain Davis,
U. S. A., and Lieutenant Sbarpe, U. S. N.,
all in full uniform, awaited in the lobby
the appearance of tho outgoing and in
coming canimanders-in-chief.
Major McKinley and Mr. Cleveland led
the way. President Cleveland showed a
trace of tbe physical suffering and hard
work of the closing days of Congress. He
walked with a perceptible limp. In or.c
hand he carried a lightly rolled umbrella,
but he did uot use it as a support. He
was dressed in a suit of black with frock
coat and unbuttoned overcoat of dark ma
terial. Like Major McKinley be had on a
silk hat, but the President-elect's hands
were encased ia gloves while those of Mr.
Cleveland were not.
Every bodj' in the lobby uncovered as
the two distinguished men passed thpm.
Following them tame Senators Sherman
and Mitchell and the members of the Cab
inetânot all of them for there was one
notable exception. Secretary Olney, who
should have led the line of his official col
leagues, was not therj and his absence
was a 4, once noticed and commented on.
It was such an unusual occurrence tbat
those who were there, busy as they were
. in inspecting every detail of one of the
most interesting events of the day, found
time to wonder why it was. With Secre
tary Carlisle, who would have Leen Mr.
Olney's companion, was Attorney-'jeneral
Harmon, while Secretaries Lamont, Her
bert, Wilson, Francis and Morton followed
two by two in the order of their official
precedence,
Mr. Cleveland was President still, so by
virtue of his oflie* he took cossession on
the right-hand s:de of the rear seat.
Major McKmiey sat by his side and Sena
tor Sherman occupied the other seat.
Very few people saw the departure from
the portico.
Cheering began from the time the Presi
dent-elect's carriage, drawn by its four
sorrels, passed through the White
House e:tte and began its passage east
ward. The escort to the Capttoi consisted
of a brieale of United States forcesâartil
lery, infantry, cavalrj-, engineers, marines
and sailors and a brigade of the National
Guard of the District of Columbia. It was
led by a platoon of mounted police and
followed immediately by the regular army
band from Governor's island.
General Horace Porter, the grand mar
shal, with a numerous array of special
and regular aids, most of them in uni
form, preceded the escort, which was com
manded by Major-General Merritt, U. S.
A. No President-elect has ever had bo
great a turnout of regular troops in his
honor. Behind them came the carriages
containing the President and President
elect, the Cleveland Cabinet, Major-Gen
eral Mies and Admiral Browne, and the
rear vaÂ« brought up by the two regiments
of District of Columbia National Guards.
Major McKinley was kept busy, remov
ing his hat constantly in response to the
cheering that preceded, followed and kopt
abreast of him. Mr. Cleveland seemed to
be in the best of spirits.
At 12:45 p. m, the first occupants marched
out of the Capitol doors to the inaugural
stand, and five minutes later the first of
the Presidential party started down the
stecs from t c bronze doors, Mrs. McKin
ley being in the lead and escorted by C. J.
Bell, chairman of tho inaugural commit
tee, and Mr. J. Addison Porter, follow
ing them came Mr. and Mrs. Barber and
Abr.er McKinley with bis venerabie
mother on his arm and the other mem
bers of the party which accompanied the
Fresident-elect from Canton. The ladies
of the Supreme Court, headed by Mrs.
Fuller, and a number of the wives of Sen
ators were also in the party. For Mrs.
McKinley a large cushioned chair Was
provided. She walked slowly, but bore
herself bravely, and as siie came down the
loiig aisle of tne platform the crowd
cheered wildly.
At 1:10 o'clock a ringing shout an
nounctd the approach of the Presidential
party. It was headed by Marshal Wright
of the Supreme Court and Marshal Wilson
of the District of Columbia. Following
them came the members of the Supreme
Ccurt. headed by Chief Juu'.ice Fuller,
with Clerk McKenney, carrying the Bible.
Then the committee on arrangements,
and next President Cleveland and Pre.-i
--dent-elect McKinley. Following these tho
other occupants of the Senate chamber,
headed by Vice-President Stevenson and
tfce Senators, reached the platform and
were seated.
The first feature of the ceremonial was
the administration of the oath of office.
Tue Bible was an immense affair, weigh
ing fully twenty pounds. It was a mag
nificent specimen of the typographical and
bookbinders' arts, bound in flexible covers
of black seal. In oue of the lids was in
serted a silver plate inscribed, "William
McKinley, President of the United States,
Inaugurated March 4, 1897."
The tumult was so great that tbe cere
mony was mere pantomime, the words of
the Chief Justice and President being
wholly inaudible to those within a few
feet of them.
When he arose to read his inaugural ad
dress there was a great cheer, but when it
subsided the crush and tumult of the rest
less moving crowd was so great that it wa-<
still impossible to hear a word. In the
midst of tne confusion President Mc-
Kinley read his address standing with
bared bead. â¢
Tbe strained relations between the
United States and Spain, growing out of
tne rebellion in Cuba, made Mr. McKin
ley's utterances on the subject of onr
foreign relations of especial significance, j
Naiurally the most interested member of j
the corps was the Spanish Minister, Dupuy
ac Lome.
When Major McKinley arose to Â«peak
he faced an audience that filled the broad
esplanade from B street on the south to B
street on the north, and stretched east- j
ward like a human torrent until it broke j
against the white walls of the beautiful
Congressional .Library building in the
rear.
McKinley read his speech from manu
script. His hat rested by his side, while j
his head was thrown back, as is usual
with him when speaking earnestly, and !
his line face, smoothly shaven and intel- j
ligent, stood out with silhouette distinct- j
ness against the background formed by j
tne massive Capitoi building. He was
dressed in dark colois und wore tbe badge j
presented to him yesterday by Post- !
master-General Wilson at the request of j
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the college
fraternity of which the President is a j
member.
Toward tbe close of the reading of the
address the commotion in the crowd
stilled and McKinley's clear, ringing
voice which has lost none of its resonant
quality since lie was last in Washington, j
penetrated to a great distance from where
i.c stood. His patriotic declaration that ;
the institutions of the country must be
preserved and the law of the land evÂ«ry- i
where recognized and obeyed evoked
great cheeriHg. The moot enthusiastic :
reception was given to the assertion lhat
in our foreign policy the recognition of
the utmost rights of American citizens
would ba insisted upon. Equal almost
was the pleasure exrressed at the au- j
uouncemeut that he would convene Con- i
gress in special session on Monday, the j
15 Ui of March, only teit days distant.
President McKinieylaud ex-President
Cievel&nd then leit tbe stand and were
conducted to the room of the Senate Com
mittee on Naval Affairs, where a luncheon
was spread lor them ai.'d their immediate
attendants. This unexpected change in
the programme was made so that there
would be no delay in the programme at
the reviewing stand opposite the White
House. Accompanying the distinguished
guests were the general in command of |
the army, the ranking admiral of the navy !
and their aids, General Porter and Rus- i
sell B. Harrison, bis aid, and the com
mittee of arrangement?, consisting of Sen
ators Sherman, Elkins and Mitchell of
Wisconsin. President McKinley ate spar
ingly, his luncheon consisting of a corn
beef sandwich, a roll, a bit of salad and a j
cup of coffee. The lunch took up half an i
hour, after which the party entered car- !
riages and the procession started on its
way up Pennsylvania avenue. The new
President came from the committee-room
urni-in-arm with the ex-President, Mr.
McKinley and Senator Shc-rnian each
smoking a cigar. The Piesident and Mr.
Cleveland took the seats assigned them
and the procession began to move up the
avenue.
The grand stand erected on the avenue
front of the White House had been filling
up all the morning with people fortunate
enough to hold the green tickets of admis
sion. This covered platform was of more
elaborate construction than anything ever
attempted before by the inauguration
committee. Its" design was classical.
W T hite was the shade throughout from
foundation to roof. A great vestibule,
forming a balcony in the front and center,
served to shelter the President and Vice-
President while the troops passed in re
view, although the fineness of the weather
made it unnecessary. Nearly every one
of the 1200 seals for invited guests was oc
cupied when President McKinley made
his appearance. A great mass of human
ity was assembled and thousands stood
packed a half dozen deep along the side

walk, while behind them, on a gigantic
stand, stretching for the entire distance
between Madison place to Jackson place,
tbe length of Lafayette square, thousands
more people reviewed the show from
comfortable seats.
Many of tnose who had witnessed the
exercises at the Capitol hurried from the
great white building on the hill to the
White House reviewing-stand to secure
good seats. Among those who were no
ticeable there were Mr. Gary, the new
Postmaster-General, with his wife and
daughter; General Russeil A. Alger; Jus
tices Harlan and White of the United
States Supreme Court, Major-General
Mile?, Adn:iral Browne, Senator Mitcliell
of Wisconsin, ex-Secretary Herbert and
Miss Herbert, Mrs. Daniel Lamont, Yang
Yu, the Chinese Minister, with the pretty
little Mrs. Yang Yu; Hcshi Tori, the
Japanese Minister, in full uniform, and
h;8 little son, who waved a triangular
flag, inscribed with Japanese characters,
which he interpreted "Hurrah for Mc-
Kinley and Kobart"; the Mexican Minis
ter and Mme. Romero; the French Em
bassador and Mrs. Paternotre, Senor An
drade, the Venezuelan Minister; the Min
ister from Hayti, the Misses Pauncefote,
daughters of the British Embassador;
Chnrles G. Dawes of Evanston, Hi., who
will be Comptroller of the Currency, and
Congressman Grosvenor of Ohio.
Slowly and painfully, almost carried in
the arras of Mr. Bell, chairman of the
inaugural committee, and John Addison
Porter, the invalid wife of the new Presi
dent made her way to the vestibule. Her
husband had entered the White House
cate just at the minute, and the echoes of
the great che-r he had received had not
died away when tLe assemblage took it up
again. It was a hearty shout that greeted
this public appearance of tne lady of the
White House. Mrs. McKinley was seated
in one of thehalf-dojsen upholstered chairs
in the glass inclosure, while Mother Mc-
Kiniey occupied another.
It was 3:2U o'clock' when McKinley as
cended the steps leading to the reviewing
stand. As he appeared at the rear central
door tne relatives, friends and guests on
the platform gave him round after round
of hand-clapping. Bowing to the crowd
with beaming countenance, he walked to
the sheltered niche selected for him. He
was cneered. as- was al9O Vice-President
Hobart as he steoped forward followed by
Mrs. Hobart. The appearance of the
President was the siinal for the baited
procession to resume its progress. A can
non boomed off in the distance and the
grand review began.
The Governors of the States as they
marched past with their brilliantly ca
parisoned staffs were loudly cheered, es
pecially Governor Bushnell, from McKin
ley's own State.
One little incident passed almost un
noticed. Ex-Vice- President Stevenson,
who had retired from office a few hours
previously, cams upon the reviewing
stand while the parade was in progress
and uroceeded to a seat unobserved, lie
watched the marching battalions for a
while and then as quietly and unosten
tatiously made bis exit through one of the
corridors.
General Horace Porter, the grand mar
shal of the parade, followed close behind
the army band of Governors Island that
led the parade. Behind him rode four
young men wearing silk hats and frock
coats, with broad sashes of white across
their breasts. They, too, received pro
found salutations from the reviewing
stand, and the people there brofce into
applause when they were recognized. The
young men were U. S. Gran;, Webb C.
Hayes, Harry A. Garrieid and Russell Har
rison, sons of ;our Republican Presidents
of the Untied States, and they acted as
special aids to General Porter. Behind
them came the grand marshal's numer
ous and brilliant staff, all riding twelve
abreast.
The marching of the regulars, cavalry,
artillery, infantry and marines drew
chet-rs along the line. Then came what
was to many the most interesting feature
of the parade â the battalion of Bailors
from the North Atlantic squadron. They
were led by Captain Sands, U. S. N., and
as he saluted the President another great
cheer went up.
The first Governor that rode by the re
viewing stand was Asa S. Bushnell of
Ohio. He was applauded lustily all along
the line of march. The Pennsylvania
troops came next and were limitei to a
single company â the Washington In
fantry.
Governor Griggs of New Jersey and his
staff followed the Pennsylvania contin
gent. The Second Regiment of the Na
tional Guam of New Jersey, cornrnandeJ
by Co.onel C. Â£. Mu>sey, niarclied with
great precision.
Connecticut and Massachusetts followed
next-witli small companies of National
Guards. Maryland had more troops in
line than any other State, and more civic
organizations, with the possible exception
of Pennsylvania. Governor Ljwntlos ana
his staff made a brilliant appearance.
Governor Black of New YorK rode in a
carnage. He was accompanied by a very
rich y uniformed mounted st.iff.
Virginia was represented by two com
panies of its National Guard. The North
Carolina troops were probably the best
drilled and most handsomely uniformed
â¢ in the parade.
The Governor of Vermont was sur
rounded by a gliteriiig complement of
staff officers and followed by four com
panies of the National Guard of that
State commanded by Colonel George H.
Bond.
Governor Tanner of Illinois mounted on
a fine gray horae rode at the head of the
Illinois troops. He was accompanied by
his staff officers.
T c Michigan troops had the recently
elecUd Governor, Hiram S. Pingree, at
their head, and he was the recipient of
much friendly notice. Governor Drake
of lowa came next.
The third division was commanded by
General O. 0. Howard, the one-armed vet
eran of Chattanooga, who. the moment he
was recognized, was given a voiley of ap
plause. His command was largely com
posed of the G. A. R. posts of the District
of Columbia. The colored troops made a
fine appearanco.
The iivic division was commanded by
B. H. Warner of Washington. He and
his staff were e?c <>rted and preceded by
the Americus Club of Pittsburg, one of
the largest political marching ciubs of the
country.
. Ex-Congressman Butterworth of Ohio,
who was Marshal Warner's chief of staff,
was cordially greeted when he rode by the
stand.
D. D. Woodmansee, president of the
National League ot Republican Clubs,
rode at the head of that organization in
the civic organ zations. The leading club
was the Cincinnati Marching Club. The
latter part of the parade was very spirited.
The cmbs marched in close order and the
number of bands was very large. Phila
delphia made a stronger showine In the
parade than any other city in respect to
numbers. Baltimore came next.
The Second Brigade of the civic parade
was led by Murat Halstead, the veteran
journalist. The most impressive feature
of the civic parade was furnished by the
Indians from the Government school at
Carlisle.
The Frelinghuy-en Lancers of Newark,
N. J., one of the oldest marching clubs in
the country, made a fine appearance, as
did the other New Jersey clubs. A Re
publican club of Atlanta, Gn,, had a great
banner mounted on a wagon, which pro
claimed mc fact that it was the first Mc-
Kinley banner swung to the southern
breezes. A company of Confederate vet
erans irom the valley of the Shenandoab,
clad in gray, met with a generous recep
tion.
Tne New York political organizations,
led by the Quinn Club, at the head of
which Congressman Quinn himself
marched, were well drilled, and appeared
to advantage. The parade closed at 5:55
o'clock, the last organization to pass the
reviewing - stand bein* the Charles T.
Kurtz Club of Columbus.
President McKinley left the stand as
soon as the rear guard passed and walked
to the White House between two lines of
guards. It took the parade two hours and
thirty minutes to pass the .reviewing
stand, and when the last organization had
gone by the President, the Vice-President
and their friends retired to the White
House.
IN THEIR NEW HOME.
President McKinley and Family
Enter the White House and Are
Welcomed by Mrs. Cleveland.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 4.â lt
was twenty minutes past 2 o'clock when
Mrs. McKinley and her party drove up to
the front portico of the White House. In
the carriage with Mrs. McK:nley were her
sister, Mr?. Barber, Secretary Porter and
CaplAin Bell. Mrs. McKinley was assisted
in alighting by Captain Charles King, the
array novelist, who is her especial escort,
in full uniform, and by Chairman Bell,
who aided her faltering footsteps across
tlie threshold of her future home, and
Mrs. Cleveland hastened from the portico
and her cordially.
The new President's mother, assisted by
her son, Abner, and his wife and her
daughter, Helen, were next welcomed by
Mrs. Cleveland, and among ths others of
the McKinley party introduced to her
were General \V. M. O3borrie, cousin of
the President; Miss Gr:ice McKinlev, Mr.
and Mrs. George E. Morse of San Fran
cisco, Miss Mary Barber, Miss Sarah Dun
can, Miss Marie Donovan, all nieces of the
President, and Captain and Mrs. Mc-
Millin and Captain and Mrs. Heistand,
Mrs. Mary Saxton, Mrs. McKinley's aunt,
â who will live in the White House; Joseph
P. Smith and Myron T. Herrick. Within
three minutes Mrs. Cleveland bad said a
pleasant word to each of these and had
bidden Mrs. McKinley an affectionate
farewell.
Then, with tears in her eyes, she en
tered Secretary Lamom's carriage and
was driven rapidly to his house, where the
retiring Cabinet ladies were awaiting her
at luncheon. She was compelled to hasten
her departure, however, and with a hur
ried handshake and a kiss to those who
have been her nearest friends she was off
again to the stafon with Secretary Thur
ber, and at 3:17 o'clock, the very moment
Mr. Cleveland was leaving the White
House, his wife, in a special car, left
Washington for her future home Prince
ton.
President McKinley's wife and mother
were assisted to the elevator and taken up
to the private apartments, where Mrs.
McKinley was made comfortable, while
the President's mother returned at a
qnarter of 3 o'clock to the family party
below and led the way to a collation
which was served informally in the small
dining-rodm, all the guests, who num
bered forty-six, standing while partaking
of the refreshments.
At 3 o'clock the entire party went out to
the reviewing stand on the front lawn
and a few minutes later the head of the
procession arrived and the President, with
his predecessor, entered the White House.
Mr. Cleveland shook hands with Mr.
McKinley and entered a carriage which
was waiting for him. There were no for
malities about his leave-taking and had it
not been for the presence of General Wil
sOn, Chief of Engineers, no one but the
President would have said good-by to
him. General Wilson assisted him and
he waved his hand to the policemen
and other attendants as he was carried
away to the lighthouse-tender Maple,
which will rake him to CurritucK bound.
President McKinley stopped but a mo
ment to inquire after the welfare of his
wife and then, accompanied by Senator
Sherman, he walked briskly to the re
viewing stand and the parade again took
up the line of march.
THE INAUGURAL BALL.
Never Did tha Grand Old Pension
Building Shelter a More Dis
tinguished Gathering:.
WASHINGTON, 1). C, March 4.â The
grand old Pension building never looked
gayer or more beautiful under the decora
tions than to-night, when ihe first gentle
man and lady in the land gratified the lm
pationce of the crowd upon its polished
dancing-floor by appearing in the balcony
and bowing their acknowledgments. The
inaugural ball was in progress.
The appearance of the President and
Mra. McKinloy and Vice-President and
Mrs. Hobart was the event of the evening.
It was 9:10 o'clock when President and
Mrs. Cleveland, accompanied by Private
Secretary Porter and Charles J. Bell, the
chairman of the inaugural committee,
arrived. They were met at the west en
trance ty a committee consisting of Gen
erals Wilson and Ruagles, Commodores
Chadwick and Joseph H. Mc'Jammon. A
6hort turn to the right brought them to
the stairs leading to the receptiou-room
on the second floor.
A number of distinguished people were
presented to the President and his wife.
Among those were Mr?. Potter Palmer of
Chicago, Mrs. S. V. R. Cruger (Julien Go-
den) of New York, Mra. Russell Harrison,
the French Ambassador, the Korean Min
ister and wife, ex-Secretary Olney, Secre
taries Sherman, Alger and Gage. A little
later Mr. find Mrs. Mark Hanna, General
Osborneatid wile and Mr. and Mrs. Abnei
McKinley arrived.
Vice-Piesident Hobart's arrival followed
promptly that of the President. He was
accompanied by Mrs. Hobart. Later a
brief reception in the apartments assigned
to them was given, and himself and Mrs.
Hobart joined the Presidential party and
assisted in receivine the invited guests.
The crowd downstairs had meanwhile
grown impatient for a sight of the Presi
dential party, and in response to their
overtures the President and Vice-Presi
dent. accompanied by their wives, walked
each to the balcony overlooking the floor.
They were repeatedly cheered by the
Indies and gentlemen who, to the number
of 5000, crowded the open space beneath.
The distinguished quartet bowed its ac
knowledgments, the band played an in
spiring air and the ball was fairly opened.
The gown worn by Mrs McKinley was
very handsome. The material was what
is known as cloth of Silesia, and those of
the ladies with her were modes of the
modiste art.
The Presidential party passed to the
din.nvi-hall from tbe gallery. First came
the escort derail of the reception commit
tee waiting four abreast. They were fol
lowed by Lieutenant Emory of the navy
and Edward McCaulev, superintendent of
the floor managers. Th<*n came a numbex
of army and navy officers, headed by
Brigadier-General Wilson.
Then came General Miles, chairman of
the reception committee, escorting Presi
dent and Mrs. McKinley, Vire-President
and Mrs. Hobart were escorted by Gard
ner G. Hubbard, president of the National
Geographic Society. As they proceeded
across the hall their passage was marked
by continued cheering, which lasted as
long as the President was in sight.
At 11:30 o'clock Mr. ami Mrs. McKinley
left the building lor the White House.
VICE-PRESIDENT HOBART.
In Fitting Manner Ho Succeeds
Stevenson as Presiding Offi
cer of tr\e Senate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 4 âAt
9 a. m., the time to which the Seuate
recess was taken, the Eun was shining in
a cloudles? sky, giving assurance of splen
did weather for the inauguration.
Admittance to the north wing of the
Capitol was only obtained through the
presentation at one of the outer doors of a
card entitling the bearer to entrance; and
those cards were restricted to newspaper
men and to others whose business re
quired their presence in the Senate wing,
and 7ery few couifl avail themselves of
that privilege. *
The Senate chamber had been com
pletely metamorphosed during the three
hours' recess. Placed closely together and
rilling all the angles of the room on one
side of tho front desks were scores of arm
chairs designed for the dignitaries who
were to participate in the ceremonies of
the day. Spectators were excluded from
the galleries while the finishing touches
were being eiven to the arrangements of
the floor.
The recess of the Senate was extended,
if not by consent at least by the non-ap
pearance of Senators, from 8 o'clock to
8:30. At that time Senator Carter (Sil. ) of
Montana took the chair as presiding
officer and cailed the Senate to order, and
then the Senate took another recess to 'J
o'clock. When this action was tafcen the
only persons in the chamber besides Stew
art and Carter were the journal clerk, the
chief clerk, the olQcial stenographer and
assistant doorkeepers and a dozen young
pages.
When tne Senate really did reconvene
the on!y necessary business before it
remaining uudone was the conference
report on the deficiency bill, which had
not yet been presented.
At 9:40 o'clock Hale presented the con
ference report on the geherni deficiency
bill. It gave the reports by number on
which agreement had been reached and of
those on which the committee was unable
to agree. The report was agreed to, but
the usual request for a further conference
waa not made.
The galiery doors were not opened until
10 o'clock, when the crowds that had been
waiting with tickets of admission flowed
in, and soon every seat wan occupied, ex
cept in the sections reserved lor the diplo
matic corps and the families of Senators.
About this time Mr. Carter vacated the
Chair andVice-President Sfevenson occu
pied it. After a little while, however, Mr.
Stevenson yielded to Mr. Hoar (R. ) of
Massachusetts.
A resolution was offered by Mr. Morrill
(R.) ofVerruont and was unanimously ac
cepted, tendering the thauks of the Sen
ate for tha "dicniriod, impartial and cour
teous manner in which the Vice- President
bad presided over the Senate." Senator
Fau kner offered a similar resolution
thanking Mr. Frye for acting Speaker pro
tern.
At 10:30 o'clock a messaee was received
from the House stating that thai body
would not agree to the Senate amend
nieutÃ to the labor commission bill. Hoar
offered an amendment which was agreed
to for the appointment of a committee of
two members to join a like committee
from the House to wait upon the Presi
dent and inform him that both houses
having concluded the business of the
present session were ready to adjourn un
less be should have some further com
munication to make. Senators Hoar and
Brice were appointed to act for the Sen
ate.
The Vice-President then called upon the
Vice-President-elect to take the oath of
office. Mr. Garret A. Hobart stood up
and with uplifted bead took the oath as
administered by Vice-President Steven
son and subscribed to it. Thereupon Mr.
Hobart took the chair and Mr. Stevenson
delivered his farewell speech as follows:
Senators: The hour has arrived which
marks the close of the Fifty-fourth Congress
and terminates my official relation to this
body. Before laying down the gavel for the
last time I may be pardoned for detaining
you for a moment in the attempt to give ex
pression to my gratitude lor the uniform
courtesy extended me, for the many kind
nesses shown mo during the time it has been
my good fortune to preside over your delib
erations. Jly appreciation of the resolution
of the Senate, persona! to myself, can find no
adequate expression in words. Intentionally
at no time have I given offense, and I carry
from tnis presence no shadow of feeling of un
kindness toward any Senatorâ no memory of a
grievance.
Chief among the favors political fortune
nas bestowed upon me, I count that of having:
been the associate, and of having kuown
something of the friendship of the men with
whom 1 have so long held official relations in
this chamber. To have been the presiding
officer of the august body is an honor of which
even the most illustrious citizen might be
proud. lam persuaded that no occupant of
this chair, during the 108 years of our consti
tutional history, ever entered upon the dis
charge of the duties pertaining to this office
moro deep!}' impressed with a sense of Vhe re
sponsibilities imposed or with a higher appre
ciation of the character and dignity of the
great legislative assembly.
During the term just closing questions of
deep imDort to political parties and to the
C untry have here found earnest and at times
pH-sioiiatefliscussion. This chamber has, in
deed, been the arenu of great debate. Tne rec
ord o. four years of parliamentary strugg'ea,
of masterful debates, of important legislation
is closed and passed now to the domain of his
tory. I think I can t-uly say, in the worJ><~>Sjr
a distinguished predecessor: >l ln the discharge
of my official duties I have known no cause,
no party, no friend."
It has been my earnest endeavor justly to in
terpret ana faithfully to execute the rules of
the Senate. At times the temptation may be
strong to compass partisan ends by a disregard
or a perversion of the rules, yet I think it safe
to ssy the result, however salutary, will bÂ«
dearly purchased by a departure from the
methods prescribed by the Senate for its own
guidance. A single instance as indicated
nughi prove the forerunner of untold evils.
'Twill be recorded for a precedent.
And many an error b/ the same example

It must not be forgotten that the rules gf-T-"
ernins this bo iy are founded deep in humau
experience, thut they are the result of centu
ries of tireless effort in legislative hal â  to con
serve, to render stable and secure the rights
and liberties wh eh have been achieved by
conflict.
By its rules the Senate wisely fixes the HmiM
to its own power. Of those who c.amor against
the Senate Â»tnd its method of procedure, it
may De truly-said: -'They know not what
they do." In this chamber ulone are preserved
without restraint two essentials of wise legis
lation and of good Governmentâ ihe right of
amendment and of debate. Great eviis often
result from hasty legislation ; rarely irom the
delays which follow lull discussion and delib
eration. In my humble judgment the historic
Senate, preserving the unrestricted right of
amendment and of debate, maintaining intact
the time-honored parliamentary methods and
amenities which uniailingly securo action
after deliberation, possesses in our scheme of
government a value which cannot be meas
ured in words.
The Senate is a perpetual body. In the terro
words. of an eminent senator, now present,
'â¢The men who iramea the constitution had
studied thoroughly all former attempts at re
publican government. History waill'irew^
with the wrecks of unsuccessful deniocrm . A y
Sometimes the usurpation of the executive
power, sometimes the fickleness and unbridled
license of the people had brought popular
governments to destruction. To guard again .%t
these dangers they placed their chief nope in
tne Senate. The Senate, which was organized
in 1779 at the inauguration of the Govern
ment, abides and will continue to abide one
and the SP.me body until tne Republic itÂ«>e.f
shall be overthrown or time shall be no more."
Twenty-seven Senators who occupied aeata
in this cnamber durinjr :ny term of ofiiee are
no longer members of this body. Five of that
numberâ Stanford, Colquitt. Vance, Stock
bridge aud Wiisonâ shattered with the cou
tentions of the great hall, fall of years aii<i
honors, have passed from earthly scenes. The
fall oi the gavel will conclude the only and
honorable terms of service of other Senators,
who will be borne- in kind remembrance by
their associates who remain.
1 would do violence to my feelings if I failed
to express my thanks to the officers of this
body for the fidelity with which they have
discharged their important duties and for tin?
timely assistance and unfailing courtesy oi
whicu I have been the recipient.
For the able and distinguished gentleman
who succeeds aie as your presiding ollicer I
earnestly invoke tb.3 same cooperation and
courtesy you have so generously accorded me.
Senators: My parting words have been,
spoken, and I now discharge my last official
dutyâ tbat of declaring the t-enate adjourned,
without day.
When Mr. Stevenson concluded his
speech he took the seat which his suc
cessor had occupied, while Vice-President
Hobart took the gavel and announced
prayer by the Chaplain. The audience
arose and remained in an attitude of rev
erence, while the blind Chaplain of the
Senate, Rev. Mr. Miiburn, opened the
Fifty-fifth Congress with prayer.
Then Vice- President iiubart made hi 9
opening speech as follows:

well-being and prosperity of the people, and
at the same time conserve the time-honored

have contributed to make this tribunal the

In entering upon the duties of the office to
which I have been chosen I feel a paculiar

It will be my object to aid you so far es I

To obstruct the regular course of wise and

Continmd on Fourth JFage.THE GRAND INAUGURAL PARADE PASSING THE REVIEWING STAND IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE
[Drawn by a " Call" artitt from a description by telegraph,]
t
WASHINGTON, March 4.â The inaugural address made by President McKinley was listened to
with close attention by those near enough to understand his words, but the crowd around the platform
was so large that many "were unable to hear him. He said:
Fellow-Citizens: In obedience to the will of the people, and in their presence by the authority vested in me by this oath,
I assume the arduous and responsible dutie3 of President of the United States, reiving on the support of my countrymen and
invoking the euidanc-* of Almighty God. Our faith teaches that there is no safer reliance than upon the Go lof our fathers, who
has singularly favored the American people in every National trial, and who will not forsake us so long as we obey his com
mandments and walk hunibiy in his footsteps. The responsibilities of the high tru-t to which I have been called, always of
grave importance, are augmented by the prevailing business conditions, entailing idleness upon willing labor and loss to useful
enterprise. This causes suffering from industrial disturbances, from which speedy relief must be had.
Our financial system needs some revision. Our money is good now, but its value must not further be threatened. It should
all be put on an enduring basis, not subject to easy attacks nor its stability to doubt or dispute. Our currency should continue
under the suoervision of the Government. The several forms of our paper-money offer, in my judgment, a constant embarrass
ment to the Government and a safe balance in the treasury. Therefore I believe it necessary to devise a system which, without
diminishing the circulating medium or offering a premium for its contraction, will present a remedy for those arrangements,
which, temporary in their nature, mieht well in the years of our prosperity have been displaced by wiser provisions. With ade
quate revenue secured, but not until then, we can enter upon such changes in our fiscal laws as will, while insuring safety and
volume to our money.no longer impose upon the Government the necessity of maintaining so large a gold reserve, with its
attendant and inevitable temptations to speculation.
Most of our financial laws are the outgrowth of experience and trial, and should not be amended without investigation and
demonstration of the wisdom of the proposed changes. We must be ''sure we are right" and "make haste slowly." If, therefore,
Congress in its wisdom shall deem it expedient to create a commission to take under early consideration the revision of our coin
age, banking and currency law--, and give them that exhaustive, careful and dispassionate examination that their importance de
mands, I shall cordially concur in such action.
If such power is vested in the President, it is my purpose to appoint a commission of prominent, well-informed citizens of
different parties, who will command public confidence both on account of their ability and special fitness for the work. Busi
ness experience and public training may thus be combined, an 1 the patriotic zeal of the friends of the country be so directed that
suca a report will be made as to receive the support of all parties and our finances cease to be the subject of mere partisan conten
tion. The experiment is, at all events, worth a trial, and, in my opinion, it can but prove beneficial to the entire country.
The question of international bimetallism will have early and earnest attention. It will be mv constant endeavor to secur^
it by co-operation with the other great commercial powers of the world. Until- that condition is arrived at, when the parity of
our gold and silver money springs from and in supported by the relative value of the two metals, the value of the silver already
coined and of that which may hereafter be coined, mu3t be kept constantly at par with gold by every resource at our command.
The credit of the Government, the integrity of iis currency and the inviolability of its obligations must be preserved. This was
the commanding verdict of the people, and it will not be unheeded.
Economy is demanded in every branch of the Government at all times, but especially in periods like the present of de
pression in business and distress among the people. The severest economy must be observed in all public expenditures, and ex
travagance sioppe i wherever it is found, and prevented wherever in the future it may be developed. If the revenues are to re
main as now the only relief that can come must be from decreased expenditures. But the present must not become the perma
nent condition of the Government. It lias been our uniform practice to retire, not increase, our outstanding obligations, and
this policy must again be resumed and vigorously enforced.
Our revenues should always be large enough to meet with ease and promptness not only our current needs and the principal
and interest of the public debt, but to make proper and liberal provision for that most deserving body of public creel itors, the
soldiers and sailor and the widows and orphans who are the pensioners of the United States. The Government shou'd not be
permitted to run behind or increase its debts in times like the present. Suitably to provide against this is the mandate of duty â
the certain and easy remedy for most of our financial difficulties.
A deficiency is inevitable so long as the expenditures of the Government exceea its receipts. It can only be met by loans
or an increased revenue. While a large annual surplus of revenue may invite waste and extravagance, inadequate revenue creates
distrust and undermines public and private credit. Neither should be encouraged. Between more loans and more revenue there
ought to be but one opinion â we should have mure revenue, and that without delay, hindrance or postponement. A surplus in
the treasury created try loans is not a permanent or safe reliance. It will suffice while it lasts, but it cannot last long while the
outlays of the Government are greater than its receipts, as has been the case during t^e past two years. Nor must it be forgotten,
however much such loans may temporarily relieve the situation, tne Governniem is still indebted for the amount of the surplus
thus accrued, which It must ultimately pay, while its ability to pay is not strengthened, but weakened, by a continued deficit.
Loans are imperative in great emergencies to preserve the Government or its credit, but a failure to supply needed revenue in
time of pe?,ce for the maintenance of either has no justification.
Tiie Lest way for the Government to maintain its credit is to pay as it goes â not by resorting to loans, but by keeping out ol
debt â through an adequate income secured by a system of taxation, external or internal, or both. It is the settled policy of the
Government, pursued from the beginning and practiced by all parties and administrations, to raise the bulk of our revenue from
taxes upon foreign productions entering the United States for sale and consumption, and avoiding, for the most part, every form
of direct taxation, except in time of war.
The country is clearly opposed to any needless additions to the subjects of internal taxation, and is committed by its latest
popular utiÂ«rance to the yyatem of tariff taxation. There can be no misunderstanding, either, about the principle upon which
this tariff taxation shail be levied. Nothing has ever been made plainer at a general election than that the controlling prin
ciple in the raising of revenue from duties on imports is zealous care for American interests and American labor.
Tho people have declared that such legislation should be had as will give ample protection and encouragement to the in
dustries and the development of our country. It is therefore earnestly hoped and expected that Congress will, at the earliest
practicable moment, enact revenue legislation that will be fair, reasonable, conservative and just, and which, while supplying
sufficient revenue for pub:ic purposes, will still be signally beneficial and helpful to every section and every enterprise of the
people. To this policy we are all, of whatever party, firmly bound by the voice of the peopleâ a power vastly more potential than
the expression of any political platform.
The paramount duty of Congress is to stop deficiencies by the restoration of that protective legislation which has always
been the firmest prop of the treasury. The passage of such a law or laws would strengthen the credit of the Government,
both at home and abroad, and go far toward stopping the drain upon the gold reserve held for the redemption of our currency,
which has been heavy and well nigh constant for several years.
In the revision of the tariff especial attention should be given to the re-enactment and extension of the reciprocity prin
ciple of the law ol 1890, under which so great a stimulus was given to our foreign trade in new and advantageous markets for our
surplus agricultural and manufactured produc s. The brief trial given this legislation amply justifies a further experiment and
additional discretionary cower in the making of commercial treaties, the end in view always to bo the opening up of new markets
for the products of our country by granting concessions to the products of other lands that we need and cannot produce our
selves and which do not involve any loss of labor to our own people, but tend to increase their employment.
TheÂ»iepression of the past four years has fallen with especial severity upon the great body of toilers of the country, and upon
none more than the holders of email farms. Agriculture has languished and labor suffered. The revival of manufacturing will

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 5, 1897.
be a relief to both. No portion of our population is more devoted to tbe institutions of free government nor more loyal in their
support, while none Dears more cheerfullyor fuily its proper share id the maintenance of the Government or is better entitled to
its wise and liberal care and protection. Legislation helpful to producers is beneficial to all. The depressed condition of industry
on the farm and in the mine and factory has lessened the ability of the people to meet the demands upon them, and they right
fully expect that not only a system of revenue shall be established that will secure the largest income with the least burden, but
that every means will be taken to decrease rather than increase our public expenditures.
Business conditions are not the most promising. It wili take time to restore the prosperity of former years. If we caanot
promptly attain it, we can resolutely turn our faces in that direction and aid its return by fiiendly legislation.
However troublesome the situation may appear, Congress will not, I am sure, be found lacking in disposition or ability to
relieve it as far as legislation can do so. The restoration of confidenc3 and the revival of business which men of all parties so
much desire depend more largely upon the prompt, energetic action of Congress than upon any other single agency affecting the
situation. It is inspiring, too, to remember that no great emergency in the 108 years of our eventful National life has ever arisen
that has not been met with wisdom and coura-e by the American people, with fidelity to their best interests and highest destiny
and to the honor of the American name.
These years of glorious history have exalted mankind and advanced the cause of freedom throughout the world and immeas
urably strengthened the precious free institutions which we enjoy. The people love and will sustain these institutions. The
great essential to our happiness and prosperity is that we adhere to the principles upon which the Government was established
and insist upon their faithful observance. Equality of rights must prevail and our laws be always and everywhere respected and
obeyed.
We may have failed in the discharge of our full duty as citizens of the great Republic, bat it is consoling and encouraging to
realize that lreo speech, a free press, free thought, free schools, the free and unmolested rights of religious liberty and worship
and free and fair elections are dearer and more universally enjoyed to-day than ever before. These guarantees must be sacredly
preserved and wisely strengthened. The constituted authorities must be cheerfully and vigorously upheld. Lynchings must not
be toleerated in a great and civilized country like the United States. Courts â not mobsâ must execute the penalties of the law.
The preservation of public order, the rights of discussion, the integrity of courts ana the orderly administration of justice must
continue forever the rock of safety upon which our Government securely rests.
One of the lessons tauglit by the election, which all can rejoice in, is that the citizens of the United States are both law
respecting and law-abi'Jing people, not easily swerved from the path of patriotism and honor. This is in entire accord with
the genius oi our institutions, and but emphasizes the advantages of inculcating even a greater love for law and order in the
future.
Immunity should be granted to no one who violates the laws, whether individuals, corporations or communities, and the
constitution imposes on the President the duty of both its own legislation and of the statutes enacted in pursuance of its pro
visions.* I shall endeavor carefully to carry them into effect.
The declaration of the party now restored to power has been in the past that of "opposition to all combinations of capital,
organized in trusts or otherwise, to control arbitrarily the condition of trade among our citizens," and it has supported such
legislation "as will prevent the execution of all such schemes to oppress the people by undue charges on their supplies or by un
just rates for the transportation of their products to market."
This purpose will be steadily pursue.', both by the inforcement of the laws now in existence and the recommendation and
support of sucu new statutes as may be necessary to carry it into effect. Our naturalization and immigration laws should ba
further improved to th* constant promotion of a safer, a better and a higher citizenship, A grave peril to this republic would
be a citizenship too ignorant to understand or too vicious to appreciate the great value and beneficence of our institutions and
laws, and against all who come here to make war upon them our gates must be promptly and tightly closed.
Nor must we be unmindful of the needed improvement among our o-s-n citizens, but with the zeal of our forefathers encour
age the s Dread oi knowledge and free education. Illiteracy must be banished from the land if we shall attain that high de3tiny
as the foremost of tbe enlightened nations of tha world, which under providence we ought to achieve.
Iteforms in the civil service must go on, but changes should be real and genuine, not perfunctory nor prompted by a zeal in
behalf of any uarty, simply bacause it happens to be in power. As a member of Congress I voted and spoke in favor of the pres
ent law and I shall attempt its enforcement in the spirit in which it was enacted. The purpose in view was to secure the most
efficient service of tbe best men who would accept appointment under the Government, retaining faithful ?Â»nd devoted public
servants in office, but shielding none, under the authority of any rule or custom, who are inefficient, incompetsnt or unworthy.
The best interests of the country demand this and the people heartily approve the law wherever and whenever it has been thai
administered.
Congress should give prompt attention to the restoration of our American merchant marine, once the pride of the seas in all
the great ocean highways of commerce. To my mind few more important subjects so imperatively demand its 'intelligent con
sideration. The United States has progressed with marvelous rapidity in every field of enterprise and endeavor until we have
become foremost in nearly all the great lines, of inland trade, commerce and industry. Yet while this is triie ; our American
merchant marine has steadily declined until it is now lower, both in percentage of tonnage and number of vessels employed, than
it was prior to the Civil War. Commendable progress has been made of late years in the upbuilding of the American navy, but
we must supplement these efforts by providing as a proper consort for it a merchant marine amply sufficient for our carrying
trade to foreign countries. The question is one that appeals both to our business necessities ana the patriotic aspirations of a
great people.
It has been the policy of the United States since the foundation of the Governnnnt to cultivate relations of peace and
amity with all the nations of the world, and this accords with my conception of our duty now. We harve cherished the policy of
non-interference with the affairs of foreign Governments, wisely inaugurated by Washington, keeping ourselves fre9 from en
tanglement, either as allies or foes, content to leave undisturbed with them the settlement of their own domestic concerns.
It will be our aim to pursue a firm and dignified foreign policy which shall be just, impartial, ever watchful to our National
honor, and always insisting upon the enforcement of the lawful rights of American citizens everywhere. We want no wars of
conquest; we must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression. A war should never be entered upon until every agency of
peace has failed : peace is preferable to war in almost every contingency ; arbitration is the true method of settlement of Interna
tional as well as local or individual difference. It was recognized as the best means of adjustment of differences between em
ployers and employes by the Forty-ninth Congress in 18S6, and its application was extended to our diplomatic relations by tht
unanimous concurrence of the Senate aud House of the Fifty-first Congress in 1890.
The later resolution was accepted as the basis of negotiations with us by the British House of Commons in 1893, and
upon our invitation a treaty of arbitration between the United States and Great Britain was signed at Washington and trans
mitted to the Senate for its ratification in January last. Since this treaty is clearly the result of our own initiative; since it
has been recognized as the leading feature of our foreign policy throughout our entire National history â the adjustment of diffi
culties by judicial methods rather than force of arms â and since it proves to] the world the glorious example of reason and peace,
not passion and war, controlling the relations between two of the greatest nations of the world* an example certain to be fol
lowed by others, I respectfully urge the early action of the Senate thereon, not merely as a matter of policy but as a duty to
mankind. The moral influence of the ramifications ot such a treaty can hardiy be overestimated i:i the cause of advancing
civilization. It may well engage the best thought of the statesmen and people of every country, and 1 cannot but consider
it as fortunate that it was reserved to the United States to take the leadership in such a great work.
It is tbe piactice to avoid as far as possible tbe convening of Congress in extraordinary session. It is an example which,
under ordinary circumstances and in the absence of a public necessity is not to be commended. But a failure to convene the
34
representatives of the people in Congress wben it involves neglect of a public, duty places the responsibility of such neeiect upon
the Executive himself. The condition ot the public treasury, as has been indicated, demands the immediate consideration of
Congress. It alone has the power to provide revenues for the country.
Not to convene under sucti circumstances 1 can view in no other sense than the neglect of a plain duty. Ido not sympathize
with the sentiment that Congress in session is dangerous to our general business interest. Its members are the agents of the peo
ple, and their presence at the seat of Government in the execution of the sovereign will should not operate as an injury but a ben
efit. There could be no better time to put the Government upon a sound financial and economic basis than now. The people
have only recently voted that this should be done, and nothing is more binding UDon the agents of their will than the
obligation of immediate action. It has always seemed to me that the postponement of the meeting of Congress until
more than a year after it has been chosen deprives Congress too often of the inspiration of the popular will and tue
country of the corresponding benofits. It is evident, therefore, to postpone action in the presence of so great a necessity would be
unwise on the part of the Executive, became unjust to the interests of the people. Our action will now be freer from partisan
views than if the tariff question was postponed until the regular session of Coneress. We are nearly two years from a Congres
sional election and politics cannot nearly so distract us as if the election was immediately pending. We can approach the problem
calmly and patriotically without fearing its effects upon an early election. Our fellow-citizens who may disa^rae with us upon
the character of this legislation prefer to have the question settled now, even against the preconceived viewsâ and perhaps set
tled so reasonably, I trust and believe it will, as to insure gr'^at permanenceâ than to have further uncertainty menacing the vast
and varied interests of the United States. Again, whatever action Congress may take will be. given a fair opportunity for trial
before the people are called to pass judgment, and this I consider a great essential to the rightful settlement of the question. In
view of tbete considerations I shall deem it my duty as President to convene Congress in extra session on Monday, the 15th day of
March, 1697.
In conclusion I congratulate the country udoh the fraternal spirit of the people and on the manifestations of good will every
where so apparent. The recent elections not only most fortunately demonstrated the obliteration of sectional or geographical
lines, but to some extent also the prejudices which for years have detracted our councils and marred our true greatness as a
Nation. The triumph of the peonle whosa verdict is carried into effect to-day is not tbe triumph of one section, nor wholly of
one party, but of all the sections and all the people. North and South no longer divide on the old lines, but upon principles and
policies, and in this fact surely every lover of the country can find cause for true felicitation. Let us rejoice in and cultivate
this spirit. It is ennobling and will be both a gain and blessing to our beloved country. It will be my constant aim to do noth
ing and permit nothinÃ to be done that will arrest or disturb this growing sentiment of unity and co-operation, this revival of
esteem and affiliation which now animates so many thouands in both the old antagonistic sections, and which I ehall cheer
fully do everything possible to promote and increase.
Let me aeain repeat the words of the oath administered by the Chief Justice, which, in their respective spheres, so far
as practicable, I would have all my Countrymen observe: "I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States,
and will, to the best of my ability, preseive, protect and defend the constitution of the United States."
This is tbe obligation I have reverentially taken befora the Lord most high. To keep it will be my single purpose, my
constant prayer, and I shall confidently rely upon the forbearance and assistanca of all the psopla in the discharge of my solemn
responsibilities.

INAUGURATED
PRESIDENT
Continued from Second Page.
not hope to acquit myse'f to your satisfaction
or with any degree of personal credit.
It shall be my highest aim to justify the
confidence ihe people have reposed in me by
discharging my duties in such a manner as to
lighten your labors, secure your appreciation
of my honest effort to administer your rules
with an eye single to the public good and pro
mote the pleasant and efficient transaction of
the public business. I trust that our official
and personal relations may be alike agree
able; that the friendships wo may form here
may be genuine and lasting, and that the
work of the Senate may redound to the peace
and honor of the country and the prosperity
and happiness of all the people.
Toen President Cleveland's proclama
tion convening the Senate in session for
the 4th of March was read, and the Vice-
President called UDon the newly elected
Senators to come forward and be sworn.
Morrill (R.) of Vermont had the dis
tinction conferred upon him, on account
of his age and long service, ot being sworn
first and alone at the clerk's deskâ the
oath being administered by Vice- President
Hobart.
All the newly elected Senators who were
present, as well as the old ones, were then
sworn in in batches of four at a time and
subscribed to the oath of office.
Each Senator, as he came forward to
take the oath, was escorted by his col
league, so that ShermaD performed, per
haps, his last official act in the Senate
chamber by escorting Foraker, Brice's
successor.
The only exception to the rule wa3 in
the case of Kyle of South Dakota, who was
escorted, not by his colleague, Pettigrew,
but by the Populist Senator from Nebraska,
Allen.
The ceremony came to a close at 1:05
p. m , when the order of exit and the pro
cession to the inaugural platform was put
into execution.-
It was 1:15 o'clock when the floor of the
Senate chamber was once more deserted,
and then the spectators in the galleries
were permitted to join in the procession.
By 11 o'clock the diplomatic gallery be
gan to fill up. The wife of the Chinese
Minister, Mme. Yang Yu, occupied the
front seat to the extreme left, and behind
her sat Mr. Sze, one of the attaches. Botn
wore their native costumes, the lady being
attired in bright silk, with large red
flowers in her toque.
She appeared to take a lively interest in
the scene, occasionally leaning over the
balustrade and peering down upon the
assemblage. Many of the other occupants
of the diplomatic galleries were ladies and
families of the Ministers and attaches.
Ex-Queen Liliuokalani came into the
diplomatic gallery at 11:30 o'clock, fol
lowed by her secretary, Mr. Palmer, but
they took seats tnree rows back of Mme.
Yang Yu.
At 11:45 the assistant doorkeeper an
nounced "The Embassadors from foreign
countries."
The Vice-President, Senators and spec
tators arose and remained standing while
the Embassadors walked down [the main
aisle, made profound bows to the Vice-
President and took the seats reserved for
them, adjoining those reserved for the
President and Vice-President-elect.
That was immediately followed by the
announcement, "The Ministers of foreign
countries," and the same ceremony was
observed as tne Ministers entered and
took seats behind the chairs reserved for
the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of
the United States. The Embassadors and
Ministers were resplendent in their uni
forms, sashes and decorations.
The next to enter were the Chief Justice
and Associate Justices of the Supreme
Court of the United States in their black
silJt robes. They occupied chairs within
the arena in front and to the right of the
Vice-President's desk. They were at
tended by the clerk of the court, who held
a splendidly bound and gilt copy of the
Bible, in quarto size, on which the oath of
office was to be administered to the new
President.
Exactly on the stroke of 12 o'clock the
Speaker and members of the House of
Representatives were announced and the
same ceremony was observed toward that
body.
The whole assemblage arose as Speaker
Eeed and the members in his train were
taking their seats, in the right hand sec
tion of the hall. Speaker Reed took his
Seat beside and to the left of the Vice-
President.
By this time the floor and galleries of
the Senate chamber were completely
tilled, and hundreds who could not get
seats crowded up against the walls and
blocked the doorways.
At 12:15 Hoar reporled that the com
mittee to wait on the President had per
formed that duty aud had been requested
by the President to extend his congratu
lations to Congress and to Fay that he had
no further communication to maice.
As soon as that report was made the
Vice-President-elec: was announced, and
all stood up while Mr. ilobari walked
down the aisle to the Vice-President's
desk and took a chair there reserved for
him to the ri^ht of the Vice-PreÂ«ident. At
12:23 the President and President-elect
were announced, and the vast assemblage
stood while Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Mc-
Kinley walked slowly down the main
aisle and took the seats reserved for them.
Finally all were seated in the following
order:
President Cleveland and President-elect
McKinley, in the two chairs in front of
the Vice-President, facing the left.
To their right, tne four Embassadors
from Great Britain, France, Germany and
Italy â Sir Julian Pauncefote, M. Pater
notre, Baron yon Thielman and Baron
Fava.
The semi-circular row of chairs facing
the Vice-President was occupied, the left
hand section by the members of the Presi
dent Cleveland Cabinet and his private
secretary; General Milas and Rear-Ad
miral Brown, in full uniform; the right
band section by the Chief Justice and
Justices of the Supreme Court of the
United States; the Marshal of the Dis
trict, Mr. Wilson, and General Porter,
marshal of the parade, with his aids.
On the right side of the hall beyond the
Supreme Court Judges were the Ministers
from foreign countries with their secre
taries and attaches, all in full uniform of
their diplomatic or military countries,
and most of them wearing crosses, medals
and ether decorations.
The Chinese and Korean embassies were
particularly conspicuous by their Oriental
attire â the Korean Minister weaiing a
green silk costume with a high conical
black hat, while seated next to him was
Mustapha Bey, the Turkish Minister, in
rich uniform and with a red fez on his
head.
PREVIOUS INAUGURALS.
It Is a Century Since tha Day of
Inducting Prosldents Into Office
Was Fixed Upon.
Inauguration day was fixed upon a
century ago. After the ratiiication of the
constitution of the United States by eleven
States the Congress of the old Confedera
tion by a vote on Eehtember 13, 1778,
"Resolved, that the first Wednesday in
January next be the day for appointing
electors in the several States, which before
the said day shall have ratified the said
constitution; that the first Wednesday in ]
February next be the day for the electors j
to assemble in their respective States and
vote for a President; and that the first
Wednesday in March next be the time,
and the present seat of Congress the place,
for commencine proceedings under the
said constitution."
The "first Wednesday" being the 4h of
March it thus became the day upon which
the quadrennial day of the Presidency
commences. The date eeidom falls upon
a Sunday, only three times during a cen
tury. The second inaugural of Monroe,
the inaugural ol Zachary Taylor and that
of Hayes Jell upon Sunday. Hayes took
the oath of office on the preceding day at
the White House.
The date, March 4, will fall upon Sun
day in 1917. 1945, 1973, 2001, 2029, 2057,2085,
2125 and 2153. Tne choice of the date was
unfortunate to the enjoyment of the im
posing ceremony by the immense crowds
which witness it, as the weather at
Washington is then usually very in
clement. Washington was inaugurated
on April 30, 1789. The ceremony of ad
ministering the oath and the delivery of
the inaugural address generally takes
place on the eastern portico of the Capi
tol, often interrupted by showers oi rain
or snow.
President Arthur was sworn Into office
at his residence In New York City, but
subsequently repeated the ceremony in
the President's room at the Capitol.
Tyler was sworn in at Brown's Hotel in
Washington.
Notwithstanding the imposing and im
portant character oi the ceremony the
journals of Congress, which usually con
tain copious mention of inaugurals, made
no mention of those of Thomas Jefferson,
of the second one of James Madison, of
that of James Monroe, nor of that of An
drew Jackson's second induction into
office.
The oath taken by an incoming Presi
dent is very brief and simple: "I do
solemnly swear that I will faithfully exe
cute the office of President of the United
Slates, and trill to the best of my ability
preserve and protect and defend the con
stitution of the United States."
GERMAN-AMERICANS.

McKinley.
The German-American Republican Club
celebrated the inauguration of President
William McKinley last nlzht by a ban
quet at Norruann Hall, 410 Bush street.
The meeting was largely attended by
the members and was called to order by
the president. Robert Wieneke, who also
acted as toastmaster of the evening.
A resolution was passed that the follow

of prosperity, William McKtnley:

WEYLER REACHES HAVANA.
His Return Probably Due to the Change
in Administration at Wash
ington.
HAVANA, CrBA, March 4.â Captain-
General Weyler arrived here at 3 o'clock
this afternoon on the transport Legasepi,
from Caibarien, province of Santa Clara.
He was accompanied by the members of
his staff.
The arrival of the party wan not ex
pected so soon and when the tignals on
Morro Castle announced that the Legasep'
was to the eastward, bound in, the news
spread rapidly and caused somewhat of a
sensation among the Spaniards, who could
not imagine why tha Captain-General
should have hurried to reach Havana.
General Weyler Janded at the Muelte de
Calabria, which is only a short dislance
from the palace. Here he was received
by the Marquis de Ahumada, who has
been acting in his stead during his ab
sence, and other authorities.
Tuere was no great crowd present and
the scene was vastly different from that
which characterized his return from the
pacification of the province of Pinar
del Rio. Instead of riding through
crowds of cheering admirers he walked
from the waterside to the palace, where
he soon retired to hi-* apartments without
having received any popular welcome.
This was due perhaps to his unexpected
arrival which did not allow of any official
preparations being made to welcome him.
No reason is eiven for General Weyler's
return to Havana*
It is well known that his campaign in
Matauzas and Santa Clara has been an
ignominious failure, and while he was
claiming to have compelled the insur
gents to retreat eastward to Puerto Prin
cipe, they had, in fact, dodged past his
columns and pursued their way westward.
It is thought that the change in admin
istration in Washington may have much,
if not all, to do with his return, as he has
been led to believe ihat President McKin
ley will not sanction the illegal arrest and
detention of American citiz?n!>, which in
many cases passed without protest from
the Cleveland Government.

A House Committee Finds the
President Absent From His
Residence.
At 11:55 A. M Speaker Reed Declared
the House Ac"j)urned Sine
Die.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 4.â When
the House was called to order at 8:30 a. m.
but two members, Dalzell (R.) of Penn
sylvania and Dcckery (D.) of Missouri,
were present, although a few others strag
gled in shortly after.
The enrollment of the sundry civil bill
was announced. The time intervening lor
an hour or two was passed in practical re
cess, waiting for the S?nate to report its
action on the deficiency bill.
At 10:30 a message was received from
the Senate announcing ita action on the
deficiency and labor bills.
Phillips (R.) of Pennsylvania, author of
the latter measure, moved that the HoU3e
agree with the Senate amendment, winch
was done.
Dingley (R.) of Maine offered the cus
tomary resolution, which was agreed to,
to appoint a committee of three to wait
upon the President and inform him that
Congress had completed its labors, and
it was ready to adjourn sine die, unless
he had something further to communi
cate to it.
The Speaker appointed as such commit
tee Dalzell (R.) of Pennsylvania, Grosve
nor (R.) of Ohio and Sayers (D.) of Texas,
the author of the resolution asking to be
excused from service.
The history of the negotiations between
the House and the S.nate on the defi
ciency bill was recalled to the House by
Cannon (R. ) of Illinois for the purpose of
showing why the House conferees would
not consent to the insertion in the bill of
the appropriation to pay the Bowman and
other claims added by the Senate. He
said it was the belief of the conferees, and
he hoped it would be the policy of the
House, that ihe-^e bills should be confined
to appropriations for meeting the current
expenses of the Government and to pay
legal claims. [Applause.]
The amount involved in the items of dif
ference was about $3,0u0,000. The con
ference report was agreed to.
The chair announced the appointment
of Northway (R.) of Ohio as a member of
the joint committee to investigate the
charities of the District of Columbia in
place of Blue (R.) of Kansas.
Cannon moved that the House further
insist upon its disagreement to the re
maining items in difference. Bingham
(R ) of Pennsylvania demanded a separate
voie upon each amendment, the effect of
which was to keep the bill before the
House to the exclusion of other matters.
At 11:30 Dalzeil (R.) of Pennsylvania,
from the committee appointed to visit the
President and notify him that Congress
was ready to adjourn Bine die, reported
that the committee had been unable to
discharge the duty devolving upon it, for
the reason that when the members
reached the White House the President
had already departed for the Capitol.
Bingham withdrew his motions for a sepa
rate vote, and at 11:40 Cannon's moiion to
further disagree and con pent to a confer
ence was agreed to, amid -ome laughter
over t lie gross improbability of anything
being accomplished.
At 11:45 o'clock Payne, Speaker pro
tern.. called Dockery (D.) of Missouri to
the chair, and his appearance there was
greeted with applause by the Republican
members. The Hoor was Tilled with Rep
resentatives, and lor the first time this
week there was intense voluntary quiet
as McMillan (D.) of Tennessee arose 10 in^
troduce a resolution of thanks to Speaker
Reed for the courtesy, fidelity ami im
partiality with which he lrad presided
over the deliberations of the House. The
resolution read :
liwolved, That the thanks of the House of
Representatives are presented to the Hon.
Thomas B. Reed, Sneaker, for the able, Im
partial and dignified manner in which ho pre
siJed over the deliberations, of tne House and
performed the arduous and important duiies
of tne chair during the present term of Cou
grcss.
On motion of Livings-ton (D.) of Georgia
the "resolution was recorded by a rising
vote, the entire body of Representatives
rising with much enthusiasm. The re
salt of the vote was announced amid ap
plause on all sides.
Speaker Reed was summoned from hia
room, and as he entered the chamber the
members rose 10 their feet, appi&uding as
they did so. Reed remained on the steps
a moment while Dockery announced the
action of the House to him. The Speak
er's usually impassive face betrayed some
thing of the emotion which he felt. His
TOice, however, was firm when he spoke.
Reed said: "Gentlemen of ihe House
of Representatives: Two years ago you
were summoned to your share of legisla
tive work which could not be otherwise
than disagreeable, disappointing and
unsatisfactory, lor it involved a dismal
struggle to adopt a narrowing income
to the growing wants of a grent Nation;
growing to be still greater. You were,
most of you, untried in your new voca
tion. How others have performed their
share of the task is not for me to say.
But it is proper to say that your shar*-' of
the mity haÂ« been performed with so much
readiness and good s-ense that even
among the asperities of a heated campaign
there was no room for an attack upon the
House of Representatives.
"1 am sincerely grateful for the kind
expression of your confidence and es
teem, but I am more grateful for tne daily
kindness and goodwill of every member of
tfie House.
"To all of you, then, gentlemen of bolh
parties, 1 off-sr the sincere expression of
the highest persona! regard."
It was just 11:55 when Reea concluded
ana declared "1 he present House of Rep
resentatives is now adjourned without
day."
The members of the House immediately
formed into line and proceeded to the
Senate chamber to take part in the in
augural Ceremonies.
SWEAR 70 CROOKEDNESS.
Miss Lucille Scott Gives Lively Evidence
in the Idaho Bribery
Case.
BOISE, Idaho, March 4.â Things are
getting quite interesting in the Idaho Sen
atorial bribery cases. Miss Lucille Scott
testified before the committee of investi
gation that Representative Perkins told
her he wanted to go home with $3000 or
$4000 and that it mattered little to him
who was elected United States Senator;
all he cared for was to mate the money
out of it.
Miss Scott also testified that she had
overheard a conversation in a railroad
eoacli between Representative George A.
Williams and a lumber - dealer of La
Grande County, whose name she had for
gotten, in which Williams said that there
was crookedness in the election of Heit
feld and gave the names of a number of
legislators, including Joines, Perkins and
McCarthy, who liad received money for
their votes, and that one legislator had
been paid $1700. The witness said she
was working in the interest of Dubois, and
that Perkins had said he could help her
and that his vote was worth $300 anyway.
H. 8. Wooley, she testified,' told her he
bad $12,000 which he could give her if sue
would secure twelve voles for any man to
defeat Dubois, and she mentioned to him
the names of nine legialators whom she
thought she could handle. Vie Bier
bower, ex-Lieulenant-Governor, and other
Republicans, she said, told her that Heit
feld had control of $40,000 sent out to beat
Dubois.
Mrs. Joines, wife of the man who made
the affidavit, testified that her husband
had given her $250 which he received for
voting lor HeiifeU.
Representative Mitchell test fied that C.
B. Wheeler offered him $1000 to vote for
Dubois, and 1 harles Bunting told him he
could get $1000 for his vote.
Representative Flanagan said Joines
tola mm several times that he could get a
large sum for voting for Dubois.

I* Much Encouraged Over the Froipecta
of n Monetary Conference.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 4.â United
States Sena:or vVolcott, who went abroad
on January 2 to organize, if possible, a bi
metallic conierence, arrived here to-day
on the White Siar liner Majestic from
Liverpool. He is in splendid health, and
hi< wifft who accompanied him was much
benefited by the sea trip.
Senator Wolcott left New York on the
first train for Washington. It was his in
tention to be present at the inauguration
ceremony at the Capitol to-day, but the
slow passage of the Maj stic, she being
twenty-four hours late in reaching this
port, prevented ttiis. The Senator said he
was much encouraged by the outlook
abroad, but he refused to go into details
regarJing what he had or had not accom
plished. He said he was very much
pleased to hear that Mr. Cleveland had
signed the monetary conference bill last
night.
After explaining that it would be im
possible for him to discuss in detail the
progress he had maile. Senator Wolcott
said: 'My visit has been a busy and thor
oughly interesting one. My lime has
been wholly spent in London, Paris and
.Berlin, excepting one day in Amsterdam.
I am much encouraged oy what I accom
plished abroad and urn most hopeful for
the future. An international agreement
for the reittonetization of silver is entirely
feasible, and its accomplishment, in my
opinion, rests largely with the United
States, and is dependent upon the course
we pursue.
"I must ask you to excuse me from
talking mure specifically at (his tim^e of
my objec:s,\becau3e what we hope to ac
complish might be seriously hindered by
premature newspaper discussion."

UPON A BIG BOOM
Greatest Activity Follows
the Harbor Commis
sion's Decision.
Bidders for the Construction of
the Breakwater Are Very
Numerous.
The Southern Pacific a Candidate for
the Jobâ Work for an Army
of Men.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 4 âSan
Pedro has entered upon the greatest
boom ever known in ttie history of the
town. The harbor decision did it. The
bidders for constructing the breakwater
are very numerous. All the great con
tracting firms in the United States â and
their name is legion â will bid for the con
struction of the breakwater. It is to the
advantage ol Los Angeles ttiat some com
pany not too remote from the coast be
given the job, and it is probable that the
contract will be let to some firm that is
near the seat of operation. There are
some contractors in Lts Angeles and
many in San Francisco who are preparing
to make bi<J* for building this great im
provement.
' It is understood that the Southern Pa
cific Company will put in a bid. Being
already on the ground this company is
well circumstanced for the work. The
Terminal Railroad Company, being on
the water front, also has many advan
taees.
But before any of the bids nre let all of
the bidders will be compelled to make
borings in the bottom of the ocean to
ascertain the bearing powers of the sub
marine stratum. This will call into play
at once a large number of men and soon
the waters of the bay will be dotted with
ell ?pec:eÂ» oi crait with borers and other
machinery. The work at the scene ol" the
breakwater will commence at once and
will be continuous, as the contracts will
be let as soon as possible after the speci
fied time allowed by law.

Feat Tribute of Lot Angeles to the Few
President.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 4.â The
new President of the United States was
voted here to-day a tribute to himself and
the clay of his inauguration that will en
dure as long as "the eternal hills."
A tally-ho loaded with representatives
of the Merchants' and Manufacturers'
Association, Mayor, Councilmen, Park
Commissioners and officials, engineer and
press representatives made a trip through
Elysinn Park to-day. The object of the
trin was to decide upon the proposed
entrance to the park and the location of
the proposed boulevard, which the citi
zens will construct now so as to give em
ployment to the idle.
The merchans and manufacturers in
i-'isSl. 1 , t n ,rri^i sufficient funds to give 15.000
days' labor at $1 per day, and the en
gineers are unanimously of the opinion
iliat the entrance should be on Bue'na
Vista street, near the present Dark en
trance. It is the intention of the en
gineers, therefore, to put in stakes at this
point at once and put 100 men at work
â¢ next Monday. Th â¢ erade will be a 5 per
cent grade at the entrance and will be car
ried northwest to a junction with the pres
ent road running to the ci y reservoir.
The highest point of all in Ehrsian Park,
which overlooks the whole slope to the
rcean as wÂ«-l! as the greater part of the
city and country around, was mounted by
the party and was christened "McKinley
Mountain" by John F. Francis. A mes
sage notifying the newly elected Presi
dent of this fact was transmitted to him
later in the day. i
CAPTAIN JAMES SENNETT DEAD.
One of California's Best Known and Most
Popular Stevedores Succumbs to
a Brief /I/ness.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 4.â Captain
Jrmes Sennett died at hia residence, two
miles from the town of Santa Clara, at I
o'ciock this afternoon, from heart failure.
Captain Sennett was taken a week ago
with a severe cold. This morning, how
ever, he appeared much better, but
shortly before noon he became suddenly
ill and Â«ank rapHly.
Captain S^nnett was born in Cornwall
in IB3S, and at the age of 12 years went -to
sea as an apprentice. When 21 years old
he was placed in charge of the brig
British Ensign of London, and for many

years continued as master of British ships
and was commodore in the service of the
Hudson Bay Company. In 1877 he retired
from the sea and located in San Francisco,
engaging in the business of stevedore.
He was married in the following year and
purchased a fine orchard home near Santa
Clara, which has been extensively im
proved and beautified. Until his last ill
ness he made daily trips between there
and San Francisco on business days. He
was a member of the Masonic order. A.
widow Survives him.
Captain Sennett was one of the best
known and most popular stevedores in
California. In 18(30 he was mauter of the
brip British P^nsltrn, and later came here
as master of the British ship Barrowdale.
After leaving the latter ship he went into
business for himselt and established the
stevedoring firm of Sennett & Co. He did
well from the start, and eventually had
control of nearly all the British vessels
thnt came to this port.
At one time the firm was known as
Sennott, Miller & Co., but after twelve
months' service in the same ship tbe tiim
ui^oived and Captain Miller went as
master of the Annie Johnson. Since that
time Captain Sennett has been alone in
the business. He was out to see the
parade on Washington's birthday and
caught a cold, which developed into
pneumonia. His death will be a loss to
shipping in general, and last night nearly
pvery British ship in port was flying her
flag at ualfmast out of respect to his
memory.

operative Association of Santa Clara
Valley, which, until recently, conducted

Charles Schucbman, son of Iho pro
prietor of the place, and Floyd Kidd were
seated in an adjoining room when the
robbers entered and, hearing the com
mand "Hands up!" Schuchninn armed
himself and went out on tho porch to
await them. He had not waiied long
when the men backed out of the barroom,
when they were greeted by Schuchrnan
with "Hands up or I'll fire!" The men
were evidently taken by surprise and
started on a run. Schuchman pulled the
trigger, but the cartridge missed lire, and
by the time he was ready to shoot again
the men were out in the darkness, from
where one of them returned the tire, the
bullet going through the barroom window
and just grazing the head of one of the
men from the Mountain House.
The robber* then went to the farm of
H. S. McMichael, where they stole a
horse and left one of their own, which
had about given ont from hard riding.
The horse tney took was put up there for
the night by L. Mitchell, a Colusa mer
chant, who was returning from Lake
County.
Sheriff Jones and posse are out after the
robbers, and as people in all directions
have been notified it is not likely they
will escape. Both are young men. The
larger one rode a sorrel mare, not shod
and without a saddle. He wore a light
slouch hat with a black band, canvas coal
and blue overalls, and was about 5 feet 10
inches tall. The smaller man was about 5
feet 8 inches. He wore a light hat, dark
coat and vest, light sweater and blue
overalls, and rode a small dark brown
mare. When last heard of they were
headed for Lake County.

Governor Lord Will Make an Appoint-
mutt, It I* Said.
SALEM, Or., March 4.â Up to date
Governor Lord has not appointed a Sena
tor, although it Is believed he will.
Whether the Senator he appoints will be
able to take his seat is an open question,
The House met to-day and adjourned un
til to-morrow. This is done to cast a
doubt upon the action of the Governor in
case he appoints. They will claim this
vacancy did not occur "during the recess
of the Legislature." It is assumed that
the Governor will appoint a gold-standard
man, ana it is the purpose of the anti-
Mitchell combination to prevent the seat
ing of a gold-standard member to the
Semite at all hazards. Governor Lord
claims that tb^re was no Legislature, and
he can therefore appoint a Senator. The
question will turn on whether the present
temporary organization is legal or other
wise, if the Governor appoints it will
not be Mitchell, but will be a protection
ist, as he will be needed in the special ses
sion to be called by President McKinley.

STOCKTON, Cal., March 4.â Stockton
furnished its quota of jollification to-day
over the inauguration of President Mc-
Kinley. Shortly after 9 o'clock the big fac
tory town turned loose all its whistles and
strangers here wondered, as they did not
know there were so many steam whistles
in all the San Joaquin Valley. All of the
mills and faciories turned their whistles
on full blast and for half an hour one
could not hear himself talk.
All day long the inauguration of Me-
Kinley was the chief topic on the streets,
and a number of prominent saloonists say
that they have been kept busy ail day
with those who have been celebrating
what they consider to be the advent of
good times.
The Republican County Central Com
mittee had been arranging to fittingly
celebrate the event and their demonstra
tion to-night showed that they had left, no
stone unturned. Shortly beioro 7 o'clocK
anvils were fired in front of Grangers'
Hall at the corner of Weber avenue and
California street and rockets were sent up
until long after the hour for the crowd to
assemble to listen .to the speakers 'who
itere to congratulate the Republicans on
the change of administration. The big
hall was well packed and Police Judge C.
P. Rendon was the iirst speaker. He was
followed by ex-Congressman James A.
Louttit, Charles Light and Colonel H. G.
Shaw, the last named of whom made the
campaign for McKinley in the mining
districts near here.

small room, where a number of men, ap
parently farmhands and laborers, were
smoking and chatting. As the youne
man, wearing a neat business suit, entered
the place ana called for a room > c was
eyed rather closely aud curiously by the
guests at the place, as it was unusual for
a person of his appearance to take a room
there, especially at that hour of the day.
To I. Adolph. the proprietor, he said
that bis name was Henry Burns. Further
than remarking that bÂ« came up by boat
this moraine from San Francisco nothing
was said between himself and A joljh.
He was in the room about thirty or forty
minutes when groans were heard in front,
and the proprietor of the place, hurrying
to the apartment whence he had shown
his strange guest, found him unconscious.
Dr. Hardness was summoned, but when
the doctor reached the younc man the
latter was dead. He did not regain con
sciousness, but died soon after, evidently
haying swallowed poison.

' THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
gXRDAY .MARCH 5, 1897
During the week ending Sat-
urday last THE CALL published
4429 inches
of advertisements, which is
1 Q inches more
than was published by any other
San Francisco newspaper during
the same time.
The new era is here.
McKinley is President.
We have seen the last of Cleveland.
The inaugural address pleases the peo
ple.
We can work now with cheer and confi
dence.
Coming prosperity is now near enough
for us to feel the glow of it
Prosperity will not come in a day, but
every day will bring some of it.
Let us get the Federal building started
and keep up with tne procession.
The way is open for the boulevard, and
now let us open the boulevard for the
people.
Congress can be counted on to support
the administration in upbuilding the
country.
Cleveland in retirement will count the
millions be has made and wonder why the
people call it a "deficit administration."
If there are any free-traders left in this
country they are so far left they are not
visible from where the procession moves
now.
. It will take an extra session of Congress
to right the wrongs of the Clevelanu ad
ministration and it is to be summoned
promptly.
The new tariff bill can be counted on to
promote the fruit industry and the sugar
industry. There will be millions in it for
California.
Let it be remembered to-day in the
home of every workingman that McKin
ley stands for an honest dollar and the
chance to earn it.
Good times cnnnct be crented by a fiat
of the President, but nevenhe e^s a Presi
dent who works for them can do much to
speed their coming.
Ti:ere will be obstacles of course in the
way of prosperity, but where there is a
will there is a way to remove them, and
McKiniey has the will.
Poor old Democracy, turned out of
doors, sits disconsolate at the foTk of the
road and hesitates whether to start for the
poorhouse or the lunatic asylum.
Many good things are expected of this
administration, but the best of all is a
policy that will open opportunities for
labor and provide wort for the unem
ployed.
We shall forget Cleveland when the evil
be has wrought shall have passed away,
but we wUI remember Mm long enough to
be careful not to elect another like him
in this generation.
McKinley will not complain of having
Congress on his hands. On the contrary,
he will gladly call Congress together to
strengthen his bands in working for the
welfare of the people.
It will be the mission of this ndminis
; ration to open the factories to American
labor and ouild up a home market that
â¢Ul render the harvests of the fields
puh'table to the farmer.
Yesterday there passed into retirement
Cleveland, Olney. Carlisle, Wilson, Hill,
Voorhees, PaJmer, Blackburn, Bnce and
Vilas. Nothing is left of Democracy at
Washington but nameless fragments.
McKinley has chosen his Cabinet welJ.
It represents business, statesmanship and
patriotism. The selection of suqli advisers
by the President gives assurance of a goad
administration ana confirms the people
in their expectations of a Government
they can be proud of.
Not much longer will goods used in
America be imported from Europe while
American mills are closed and American
workinjjinen are begging for employment.
We have got to the end of that sort of
legislation. It has been carried into re
tirement in the gripsack of Grover.
To restore the protective tariff, to re
establish reciprocity treaties, to build up
our industry, to expand our commerce
and to juve unfailing protection to Amer
icans abroad are the tasks McKinlev and
the Republican party have undertaken,
and the people can rely upon it that they
will be successfully accomplished.
The only cloud upon the horizon is the
Senate. That body has power to delay
the passage of a protective tariff, and some
Senators will certainly make an effort to
do so if not deterred fay the expression of
public indignation. Warning should be
civen to these obstructionists at pnee.
The country will have no patience with
any man or set of men who undertake to
prevent a restoration of business and a
return to prosperity.
THE INAUGURAL ADDRESS.
In his inaugural addrets President McKinley spoke to the country what Tenny
! son called "large, divine and comfortable words." It vras a speech of good cheer. It
carries confidence to the people. There is nothing in it to arouse antagonism or
distrust among any class of citizens. On the contrary every sentiment and every sen
tence appeals to the patriotism of the people, inclines to harmonize discordant
opinions, and gives promise of a return to prosperity and the establishment of an era
oJ good feeling which will put an end to economic disturbances and political agita
tions on industrial topics.
The President gave no space in his address to a vacue exordium. He proceeded
at once to consider the condition of the country and to outline the policy which he
would adopt in providing remedies for existing evih. "The country," he said, "is
suffering from industrial disturbances from which speedy relief mu't be had. " He
spoke of "the prevailing business conditions entailing idleness upo;i willing labor
and loss to useful enterprises.' From this beginning he went on to speak of the im
portance of legislation to promote general prosperity and to suggest the lines on
which it should be undertaken.
The President counsels the creation of a commission to revise our coinage, cur^
rency and banking laws; promises that international bimetallism will have early and
earnest attention; advises economy in the conduct of the Government and an
increase of revenue by tariff taxation, avoiding as far as possible every form of dirtct
taxation, to the end that industry may be protected as well as a revenue supplied to
the Government; urges that in the work of tariff revision attention should be given
to the re-enactment and extension of reciprocity principles; declares for the enforce
ment of the law and the preservation cf the rights of citizens; pledges the adminis
tration to enforce all laws against combinations of capital organized to control
arbitrarily the condition of trade; suggests improvements in our naturalization and
immigration laws; assures support to civil service reform of a kind that shall be "real
and genuine, not perfunctory or prompted by zeal in behalf of any party, simply
because it happens to be in power"; calls attention to the need of restoring our
American merchant marine; favors the adoption of the nroposed arbitration treaty
with England, and announces that an extra session of Congress will be called to meet
March 15.
The points of tne address which will attract most attention are those referring to
the creation of a commission for the settlement of the currency and banking problems,
the enforcement of the law against trusts, the policy announced with respect to civil
service reform, the support given to the arbitration treaty, and the importance of an
extra session of Congress. The declarations in favor of an immediate revision of the
tariff will occasion little comment because they were expected, and discussion on
that subject is ended. It is everywhere admitted that we must have a revenue
adequate to the needs of the Government, and since the disastrous experiment with
the Democratic tariff there is no longer any opposition to a return to the protective
system.
It will De noted that the President put 9 the tariff issue first, and declares that r.ot
until an adequate revenue is assured can we undertake to make any changes in our
financial system. This is in accord with public opinion, and will strengthen popular
confidence in the policy to be pursued by the administration.
The appeal of the President to Congress to nupport him in the work which he has
undertaken cannot be overlooked. He truly says: "The restoration of confidence
and the revival of business, which men of all parties so much desire, depends more
largely upon the promDt, energetic and intelligent action of Congress than upon any
other single agency that affects the situation.' 1 This fact is known, and the people
rely upon Congress to act promptly in meeting the emergency.
WOEK TOE THE UNEMPLOYED.
The movement now started to provide
work for the unemployed in this City is
most timely in every respect and deserves
the most liberal support from all citizens.
; It promises good results not only to the
I workingmen to whom it will give employ-
I ment, but to the community generally,
! and is in the tmest sense a public enter
prise rather than a charity.
The proposed boulevard, for which the
| Spring Valley Water Company and ex-
Mayor Sutro have given a broad right of
way, will provide San Francisco with a
driveway not inferior to the most noted in '
I the world. Its construction will be a
benefit by giving employment to many
! who need it, and its completion will be an
advantage to the City which it is hardly
\ possible to overrate. Its usefulness will
I increase as the years pass and it will
i eventually become one of the noied at
â  tractions of the City.
The movement in this City is timely
| moreover because it accords with the
â  aspirations of the Ipeopie and will be a
j part and parcel of that great National
! policy which the new administration is to
; carry out. The platform on which Mc-
Kinley was elected was that enunciated
by himself in the terse statement that he
j advocated for the American people "an
j honest doilar and the chance to earn it."
| The new administration will pursue a
j policy radically different, from the old. |
' Its chief aim will be to provide opportu
| nities for labor and wort for the workers.
j Its mission will be the same as that which
> has been undertaken in this City to pro
' vide work and good wages for the unem
ployed.
The beginning of an administration de
! voted to such a policy constitutes an epoch
: in our history so different in its nature
I from that through which we have just
! passed that it rightly deserves the title
| given to it by the people, "a new era."
i It will be a period in which loghlation will
i be directed to the end of opening Ameri
j can factories, developing American re
| source?, expanding American commerce,
I providing profits for American capital
| and assuring work and wages for Ameri
! can skill, energy and industry.
No policy, either civic or National, can
be better than ttiat which aims to provide
work for the American people. The lack
of employment implies something more
> than enforced idleness. It carries destitu
| tion into the homes, ruin to debtors, and
distress to all. A policy of abundant
work means the upbuilding of the home
as well as of the. Republic. It means
prosperity and comfort by the fireside as
well as grandeur and wealth at the Na
tional capital. It is most appropriate,
therefore, that this season which inaugur
ates the beginning of an administration
i pledged to promoie American industry
should be marked by a municipal move
! ment directsd to the same end. Every
i citizen who can afford to do so should
i give sucu assistance as he can to the
! undertaking. L^t us provide work for the
â  workers. Let us see to it that in San
! Francisco no industrious man has his
home destitute because he cannot find the
labor which he is willing to perform.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
In the appropriation bill as agreed to by
the Senate in the closing hours of its
session on Thursday morning ttie appro
priation of $150,000 for a new survey of the
Nicaragua canal remains. This implies
that the new administration is expected
to revise the work of the Cleveland ad
ministration on this subject and to begin
the great enterprise anew.
From the representations made to the
Senate a short time ago by the Minister
from the Greater R-public of Central
America, it is evident that the continuance
of the project in regard to the canal will
be in the hands of the State Department
rather than of Congress. The opposition
shown by the Greater Republic transfers
the project to the field of diplomacy, and
until some treaty can be arranged, nothing
can be done by this Government unless
the United States should resolve to do it
by force.
Fortunately for the country the new
Secreiary of State is John Sherman. He
is known to be favorable to the enterprise,
and can be relied upon to exert his ener
gies to obtain from the Central American
Republic terms which will admit the con
struction of the canal by the money of
the United States and under the control of
the lJuited States. Certainly this Govern
ment will never consent that the canal
should be opened except under our control.
As Great Britain asserts the right to close
the Suez canal to any foreign power,
which in case of wur might choose to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 5, 1897.
attack her possessions in East India, so
would we assert our right in case of war
to control the Nicaragua canal against
any power that desired to use it to send
warships to attack the Pacific Coast.
While the situation remains as it is it is
not easy to predict the next step which
will be taken in tne project. The very
fact, however, that the Senate left in the
appropriation bill a sum of money to pro
vide for a new survey makes it certain
that the Senators have confidence in the
ability of Secretary Sherman to arrange
terms for a speedy beginning of the con
struction of the work. The outlook there
fore may be considered encouraging, and
it is within the limits of probability that
the McKinley administration, which is so
thoroughly in harmony with all Ameri
can ideas, may provide a way for the be
ginning of the enterprise, and go far to
ward carrying it to completion.
THE CAUSE Of CUBA.
The measures taken by the Cuban relief
committee of this City to call a mass
rneeting assure the success of that assem
bly. The cause itself is popular, not only
by reason of American sympathy with the
Cuban patriots, but by its essential jus
tice, and by the further fact that the
rights of American citizens in Cuba seem
to be inseparably bound up with the pa
triotic cause by the despotic course pur
sued by the Spanish authorities in deal
ing with Americans who are suspected of
sympathizing with the patriots.
In addition to this the mass-meeting
will bo rendered interesting to the people
because it will be addressed by some of
the most eloquent orators ana eminent
citizens of the community. It will there
fore have abundant claims on public at
tention, and will assuredly be a thorough
manifestation of the sentiraent3 of the
people of San Francisco. The date for
the mass-meeting has been fixed for the
l.Jth, providing Metropolitan Hall can be
obtained for that day. At any rate the
meeting will be he'd as early as possible,
in order that San Francisco may promptly
add her weight to that of her sister cities
in tne Union in promoting the cause of
the Cuban patriots and asserting the
rights of American citizens who have suf
fered irom Spanish despotism and tyr
anny.
It is altogether right that this should be
so. When all other cities of the Union
Dare spoken it would be a discredit to San
Francisco if her voice should be silent,
and there can be no question that every
genuine American in the City will be glad
of tLe opportunity to attend a meeting
called lor that purpose, and give utterance
to his approval of this declaration of
American sympathy for the Cuban pa
triots and American determination to
protect all citizens of the United States in
loreien lands.
It is hardly necessary to say more at
this time than 1o call attention to the
propo*ed meeting. In due time the date
finally fixed will be announced and the
name 3ot the speakers who are to deliver
the addresses will be given. When this is
aone it goes without saying the people
will arrange their affairs so that they can
be present at the meeting without fail.
Reports from Cuba have made it certain
that American citizens have suffered
grievous wrong from the Spanish officials
in the island, and every American well
understands bow important it is that
these wrongs should be redressed. More
over the people know that they hava now
in the office of President of the United
States a man who is thorough accord with
public sentiment, who sympathizes with
every impulse of the people and who is
resolute to uphold the dignity of the Re
public. To what the people speak he will
attend. The mass-meeting therefore will
be something more than a display of ora
j tory. It will be an encouragement to
; President McKinley to go forward and en
force a foreign policy which shall be for
eign in name only and truly American in
every respect.
"UNEMPLOYED' GOLD-DIGGERS.
The plan of providing a store of unlimited
work for the unemployed by tending them to
the mining regions to dig gold is being ac
tively by some people connected
with the Labor Bureau and with the mining
industry, and will likely be a matter of public
discussion very soon.
This solution of the standing problem of the
uuem ployed in California seems easy, cheap,
faultless and yet beset with difficulties that
make i: seem almost impracticable. The plan
ought to be carried out at once, and likely
never will De.
In its simplest form the schema is like this.
l*p in Trinity County a number of miles from
the railroad there is a bead in Poor Man's
Creek on sterile Government laud, iiost of
the gravel nlong and under the stream was
worked over by placer-miners long ago and
the placer-mining claims have been aban
doned. Muca of the gravel is tailings con
taining a little gold and there are thousands
of cubic yards of unworked deposits which
contain traces of gold. The water is right
there and ouo man or a little party of men
could average from 75 cents to $1 25 per day
by hard work with rocker or sluice. Nobody
cares to bother with this gravel. Five miles
below a gang of Chinese is industriously earn
ing these wages. They are not unemployed.
One of these days a lot of them will pack their
rice and a little lumber over to Poor Man's
Bend and go cheerfully to work getting more
gold Â»,o go back to China with.
Down at Howard and" New Montgomery
streets John Willing Jones slept last night on
the barracks floor, and ate his share of the
day's charity at 3:30 P. M. He pawned his kit
of tools some time ago, and he is knee-deep in
a wide morass of city poverty, with thousands
of others, which is more hopeless and cursed
than being as deep in a narrow mud-hole,
with linn ground and sunshine about. He
would start promptly to walk to Fresno if he
knew that he could earn a dollar a day when
he got there.
Jones has seen pictures of miners with their
pans and rockers by streams in the hills, and ,
that's about all he knows about mining. But
if you tell him that you know a place, a good
way off, where, he can earn a dollar a day
digging gold, if he can get a shovel attd pick
and a few boards; that he can dig a hole to
sleep in, or build a little shelter of logs and
brush; that he can live if he can get a littlg
bacon, flour, coffee and aiishl-ine; that in two
â or three weeks he can get together enough
gold d\ist to provide him a belter outfit, and
that if he is sober, industrious and resolute he
may soon enjoy independent manhood amid
nature's pure air and sunshine, he will junVD
at the opportunity with more gladness and
hope than he would at six months' work on a
boulevard. You see, the lure of "gold dig
ging" is in it, and the hape in it gleams in
spiringly.
There are through the gold belt of California
many thousauds of acres ot such ground, and
though they are very thinly ..spangled
with the golden grains they hold many mil
lions in treasure. They constitute the resi
due after the placer operations of the years
since 1848. The placer miners have taken
out hundreds of millions, and the richness is
gone from all the surface deposits, but the old
placer miners didn't get all the gold from the
gravel they hustled over the riilles, and vast
quantities of that same old gravel will just
pay for the re-working. Greater quantities that
have always been ignored because too poor to
work by hand labor line the water courses.
Most of this ground is in tlie hands of pri
vate owners, and pieces of ground are fre
quently worked after negotiations with the
owner. Hydraulic companies own bigstretches
of it here nnd there. Much of it is on railroad
lands, with the privilege of working easily
procurable. Here and there are soots, little
and big, on Government land, which nobody
wants. One may wash gravel on public land
as freely as he may gather greens. It is not to
be disputed that a man or a small party of
men may go to one of thousands of places in
this State end thus make a living.
The difficulties appear when actual opera
tions on a large scale are- contemplated. The
bureau in charge must liud definite prices of
ground and Know just the value of the gravel
that here or there three or thirty men can earn
so much. It is the idea that the Mining Bu
reau should locate the ground and plan opera
tions. This aud the matter of getting the un
employed there and started each involves or
ganized machinery and expert effort. The
human nature in the unemployed would pro
vide for the difliculties.
Tu;b would be substituting gold patches for
potato patches. The pian is extensively and
success! ully followed by the colonial govern
ments of New Zeslaud and Australia. With
the gold-beariug commons of the mountains
and foothills charted and assayed by a\ailable
patches, and a way o; getting industrious men
there with picks and beans, there would be a
reservoir of productive labor waiting to be
tapped to any extent. It sounds easy in theory
and the gold is there. The trouble is to get
the thing kÂ» work. James Orr.

It is iv contemplation for the Queen to hold
a Chapter of the Garter at Windsor Castle on
June 20 or 28. the funct.on to be fallowed by
a banquet to the knights of the order in St.

On these occasions all knluhts have aright to
take part in the proceedings, but only those

Probably no greater doctor's fee is on record
than that paid by the Empress Catherine to

HE BROKE THE
WORLD'S RECORD
The Formidable Thousand-
Mile Race of Henry J.
Mayham.
Was Journeying Over Prairies
and Plains to Sea His
Dying Son.
Mr. Mayham Will Soon Go From Here
to His GrlJ Properties in
$ vada
Henry J- Mayham, the millionaire
mine-owner of Denver, who made the rec
ord-breaking run recently on a special
train from Chicago over the Burlington
road to Denver, is at the Palace. Mr.
Mayham was at Fort Wayne whence got
the news that bis son was dying. He
immediately wired for a special train from
Chicago.
An engine which had just come in over
the road was got in time and the general
superintendent proffered his own car.
Snow had been falling and the outlook
was unpropitious for making the fast time
desired. Mr. Mayham wanted a cuar
antee that he would reach Denver, a dis
tance of 1025 miles, in twenty-four hours.
He could not exact this promise, but ha
was assured tnat it would be the quickest
trin by far that ever was made.
And it was. From the time that the
wheels began to turn out of the union
depot till it reached the base of the Rocky
Mountains the pace was something fright
ful to contemplate. The entire distance
was compassed in 1133 minutes, or a little
less than nineteen hours. Of this eighty
six minutes were occupied at different sta
tions in taking on water and supplies and
changing and oiling engines. The actual
running time was 1047 minutes, and the
rate of speed was within a fraction cf
fifty-nine miles an hour on the average,
or almost a mile a minute.
in its trip to the base of the Rockies tha
train climbed a height of one mile. Mr.
Mayham says the rule was in all respects
a wild one. The engine and car in many
places swayed to and fro as if flying
through suace.
Where sharp turns were made the sway
ing was enough to make one's hair turn.
Across a part of Illinois and over nearly
all of lowa the surface is undulating, so
that it was a terribla pace to keep up.
Take it all in all, for the great distance
and the time in which the feat was done,
it was the greatest speed ever attained.
Mr. Mayham is interested extensively
in mining at Gold Creek, Nevada; fifty
miles north of Elko. He will visit tha
mines before returning East.
HE WILL RECOVER.

DURRANT URBANE
AND COMPLACENT
Has Hopes the End Is
Still in the Distant
Future.
His Attorneys Are Busy Plan*
ning New Tactics for
His Defense.
The Police Refuse to Allow the
Destruction cf the Emmanuel
Church B;lfry.
Durrant still has hope and his attorneys
profess a kindred emotion. There were
councils of war between the prisoner and
tome of his legal representatives yester
day, but nothing definite was accom
plished.
According to law his attorneys have
tnirty days in which to file a petition for
a rehearing of the case. Denprey has al
ready intimated that this plan will be
resorted to, but lawyers in general say
that in view of the fact that an over
whelming majority of the Supreme Conrt
Justices signed the decision handed down
Tuesday afternoon the probabilities of a
rehearing being granted ara rather re
mote.
All of the attorneys interested in the
defense have become suddenly reticent as
to their future tactics in behalf of the
prisoner. Deuprey himself talks in glit
tering generalities, and beyond making a
general declaration that bis client's
chances are not by any means exhausted
reluses to discuss details.
Granting that a rehearing is refused the
law provides that the date of the execu
tion must be set within ninety days at
the most from the passing of sentence.
Accordine to this programme the pris
oner has yet 120 days to live at the
longest, should his attorneys fail to dis
cover some new means to drag him out of
thp meshes that ate closing about him.
Eugene IN. Dpuprey of counsel for Dur
rani called yesterday afternoon at the
jail to discuss the Jatest phase of the case
with his condemned client. Dnrrant left
his cell and, escorted by one of the jailer*,
walked to the office io meet the attorney.
Although apparently undisturbed at the
crusning blow received at the hands of tbe
supreme tribunal of the State, nn expres
sion of uneasiness crept over tbe young
prisoner's face when he approached the
man of law.
Mr. Deuprey shook his client warmly by
the hand and they were soon discussing
the situation. The meeting was not a
lengthy one, but at the end Durrant
smiled as though he could see something
favorable to himself".
Wednesday Durrant stolidly refused to
be seen by representatives of tne press ana
his cell-mate, a man named Sierp, cour
teous and affable in manner, informed
callers that his companion wished to see
no one.
Yesterday, however, Durrant received
many callers, but would discusa his ca-e
with no one. "I still have hope. There
is yet time for a stubborn le^al battle for
my rights," is all he would say in connec
tion with himself; but on otner topics of
interest he was willing to converse.
Mr. and Mrs. Durrant, the convicted
murderer's parents, visited their son yes
terday afternoon. The meeting was an
affectionate one, but was unaccompanied
by unusual incident.
Mrs. Durrant cheered her- son, and ex
pressed the hope that some event would
yet show the world that her boy was in
nocent.
The case against Durrant for the mur
der of Minnie Williams, although never
tried, is still pending, and according to
District Attorney Barnes will not be dis
missed as long as the prisoner remains
unpunished for the murder of Blanche
Lamont.
The trustees of the Emmanuel Baptist
Ciiarch are anxious to demolish the belfry
in that structure on account of the asso
ciations connected with it.
They declared their intention of tearing
it down at the time of Durrani's convic
tion, but were warned by the District At
torney and Captain Lees that they would
be restrained by law if they attempted
this work. The project was renewed again
yesterday, when the news that the Su
preme Conrt had sustained Judge Murphy
became known, only to be again admon
ished by the District Attorney to refrain
from carrying out their wishes until the
case was finally disposed of.
"That belfry is my corpus delicti," said
Barnes yesterday, "and I don't intend to
lose it until Durrant is disposed of. It's
too valuable a piece of evidence to lose at
this stage of the proceedings."
LIBERAL WITH CHECKS.
XV. F. Kajioni a Keceut Arrival From
Chicago, Arrested on a Felony
Charge.
W. F. Kasson, a recent arrival from
Chicago living at 542 McAllister street,
was booked at the City .Prison by Detec
tive Harry Reynolds and Policeman J. J.
Rivers last evening on the charge of ut
tering a fictitious check.
Kasson Bays be is in the publishing busi
ness and is 32 years of age. He has been
parsing and attempting to pas* bogus
cheeky on storekeepers in the Western
Addition.
February 26 he ordered 75 cents' worth
of coal from Patrick Quinn, coal-dealer,
238 Fulton street, and gave him a check
for $10 on the First-National Bank signed
by the California Commerce Company.
W. F. Martin, manager, receiving $9 25
change. The check was found to be worth
less. The same day he got a bogus check
for $10 cashed by Kuifs Bros., grocers, Van
Ness avenue and Grove ptreet, but a man
who indorsed it refunded the money.
About three weeks ago he bought 40 cents'
worth of groceries from H. Hancten,
Franklin and McAllister streets, giving a
$10 bogus check. Hancten gave him $5
and said he would fcitnd him the balance
some other time. When Hancten found
the check was worthless he made Kasson
refund the money.
Among those ha attempted to pass
worthless checks upon were: V. M. Sulli
van, grocer, 500 Franklin street; David
Adler. butcher. 240 Fulton street; J. Wil-
Jiams&Son, fruit-dealers, 643 McAllister
street; J. Lilienthal, 444 Van Nessavenue;

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 5, 1897.
After Repairing at Port Stanley the British Ship Eaton Hall Resumed Her Passage for San Francisco.
"When Passing Out She Was Caught in a Snowstorm and Nearly Went on the Rocks.
Captain Lowrison Is Not Only a Photographer Eut an Artist of No Mean Merit, and the
Above Is Taken From a Sketch Made by Him.
WAS CAUGHT IN
BLINDING SNOW
The Eaton Hali Had a
Number of Narrow
Escapss.
Leaving Pert Stanley She Nearly
Went Ashore in a
Gale.
Captain Dan McLean Was Bound for
Salvador, but Ezeta Was Taken
Sick
One of the oldest timers in port is tbe
British ship Eaton Hall, and tne most
popular of the old-timers is Captain
Lowrison, her commander. In 1887 he was
here in the Kamehameha IV, and the fol
lowing year Â«aw him in command of the
Eaton Hall. In '89, '90 and '92 he aenin
visited this port, and then for a season
he deserted San Francisco. It did not
bring him any good luck, iiowever, as last
year he had to put into Port Stanley in
distress. The Eaton Hall had been in a
storm, and many of her sails bad been car
ried away. The port bulwarks were stove
in, and everything movable on neck was
adrift. After making repairs at Port Stan
ley, Captain Lowrison set sail again for
San Francisco; but just as he came up to
the cape and the rock that guard the en
trance a snowstorm came down, which
made navigation very difficult.
The vessel was worKed out to sea, how
ever, and reached San Francisco in safety.
"It was the narrowest escape I eyer had,"
Baid Captain Lownson yesterday. "The
snow was blinding and we were between
Scylla and Cliarybdis. On one side was
a treacherous ledge of rock and on the
other the point that guards the entrance
to Port Stanley. We got out all right,
however, and reached San Francisco iv
safety."
The Eaton Hall is only partly unloaded,
and is now lying in Mission Bay awaiting
a chance to finish discharging and for a
charter.
Tho Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
meda, that sails to-day for Australasia,
will take away a very heavy cargo of
canned goods, hops and broomcorn. The
ten performing horses and ten trick ponies
thai hiive been on exhibition at the Chutes
will also go down on the stearuer. They
grill be exhibited at Honolulu, and from
there will go on to Auckland, New.Zea
land, on the Marlposa. The mail is a day
late, but nevertheless the vessel will get
away at 2 p. m. sharp to-day.
The iiai-k Cyrus Wakefield got in from
New York yesterday in the remarkable
time of 91 days. This is a record that
has not been beaten in years and ship
masters assert that it will be many a long
day before it is equaled. Captain Henry,
however, is noied for quick passages. He
takes chances that other masters would
not venture on and always succeeds. On
thb Cassandra Adams and Jabez Howes he
made better time than any other skipper
that had been in them, and some of the
old-timers now in the boneyard he took
up and made clippers oefore they retired
into private hie and oblivion. The Wake
geld had the usual run of bad weather
rounding the Horn, but un the coast she
was very fortunate and Captain Henry
managed to secure a tow just when he
wanted it most.
Captain Calhoun of the bark Ceylon
decorated his Vessel yesterday in honor of
the inauguration of McKinley. He is 72
years old and has been a Republican since
lie had a vote. He predicts good times
and asserts that the Ceylon will earn
twice as much this year as she did last.
Captains Dan and Alec McLean are to
gether again. Dan quit the Nicolene in
Central America and in now taking care
of the XJna, over which the Custom-house
held an embargo for some time. Captain
Dan was to have gone to Salvador, with
Ezeta, but the latter feli sick. A schooner
on the Atlantic side was nil ready and Mc-
Lean was to pilot the filibusters to their
destination. When the originator of the
scheme was taken sick the expedition fell
through and McLean came to San Fran
cisco for a rest. When he will start back
again Dan refuses to state. In the mean
time he and Alec are preparing for a
grand coup.
The barkentine Arago made the run in
thirty-two days ftom Kob j , and the ship
Eclipse in twenty-eifcht days. Both ves
sels were in last month's southeaster, but
instead of dome any damage it help them
on their way.
The late A. Page Brown's plans for the
new ferry depot . w<> re under discussion
again yesterday. Harold Wheeler, attor
ney for the estate, put in n bill to the Har
bor Commissioners' for $4fJOS, but it was
not acted upon. President Colnon said
that owing to the number of errors found
in the plans, it would be well to make an
investigation before going Â»oy iunher.
The matter w.is referred to Chief Engineer
Holmes and Architect Swain.
The Tvork of repairing Powell-street
wharf was let to Heaiy, Tibbitts <fe Co. for
$1373. Darby Lr-ydon <fc Co.'s bid was
$1375, wnile Cotton Bros. & Co. wanted
jl(i7B to do the job.
Captain "Patsey" Anderson has got
tired of ranching and will go back to the
sea again. He is as thin as a rail and his
hands are all calloused from using the ax
and shovel and guiding the plow. He is
more than glad to net a smell of salt water
again and will co out on the Alaska run
ac master of the Dora next week.
VETERANS EELIEVED.
Not Required to Pay for Swearing to
Their I'i'iih on Claims.
Several hundred old veterans and sur
viving widows of veterans were made
happy yesterday by learning the fact ttiat
the iaw imposing a fee of 75 cents for each
affidavit on their pension paper nad been
repealed.
By some inadvertence the fee bill was so
amended that it left the veterans and
other pensioners on the same plane with
other persons requiring ti.e services of the
County Clerk in attesting their signatures.
When County Clerk Curry had this mat
ter called to bis. attention he had a special
bill drafted and went to Sacramento for
the purpose of urging its passage. Deputy
County Clerks Harry Piper and J. B. Me-
Closky also went to Sacramenio in the
interest of this measure, paying their own
expenses. Governor Build promptly
signed the bill exempting pensioners from
the payment of such fees and the law was
observed to their relief yesterday.
CAPT. GOODELL'S TRIAL.
Ths Commander of the River
Steamer Dauntless Faces
Charges
Testimony of Employes of the V:ssel
Was Almost Altogether ia
H s Faver.
The Investigation into the charges
against Captain Goodell of tne Union
Transportation Company's steamer Daunt
less was begun before Inspectors of Hulls
and Boilers Bolles nnd Phillips yesterday.
Captain Goodell is accused by C. B.
Manges, a discharged waiter of the vessel,
of having left the pilot-bouse in tbe hands
of an unlicensed man and of spending his
time drinking with passengers and talking
with Mrs. Carrie Joseph, the stewardess.
Nicholas Roster, another ex-employe of
the Dauntless, who was called by Manges,
testified that he had often seen the cap
tain leave the pilot-home and go into the
pantry, where he would drink beer and
smoke.
MuteS. N. Johnson stated that he had
soen Captain Goodell leave the pilot-house
on several occasions, but it was always to
go to lunch or to attend toother necessary
matters. He slated in reply to a question
from Captain Goodell that he knew it was
necessary for the captain to answer the
calls of patrons of the vessel.
Chief Engineer Henry's testimony was
similar to thgt of the mate.
Frank Marshall, who was left in charge
of ihe pilot-house when the captain was
out, testifiel that the captain never left
the pilot-house except at wide points on
the river where there was little danger
and then only to get his lunch or attend
to other necessary matters. He was never
gone more tnan a few moments.
He said that he himself was a compe
tent pilot, having been on the river six
teen years, and that he had not taken out
his papers because he could not read and
w:ite English.
Ben Berringer, the bow watchman,
stated that the captain never left the pilot
house except when absolutely necessary
or when it was permissible that he should.
Manges' testimony was simply a reitera
tion of the charges filed.
The hearing was continued to give Cap
tain Goddell an opportunity to produce
witnesses.
Suits for Divorce.
Suits for divorce have been filed as follows:
Theriaia Kaiser against John Kaiser, for

AFTER CITY HALL
CONTRACTORS
Metal and Marble Unions
Complain of Poor
Work.
The Building Trades Council
Has Ccndemned the Com
missioners.
The Attention of the Grand Jury Will
Soon Be Called to These
Matters.
At the meeting of the Building Trades
Council last evening at 9iS% Market
street the reports showed that tue council
is steadily increasing in membership.
The delegates of the Marble Cutters' and
Finishers' Union were seated. Delegate
J. T. McCann explained the position of
the marble-cutters with reference to the
marble work being done on the dome of
the City Hall. He said that his union bad
denounced the manner in which the work
is being performed.
He stated that there is a marked incom
petency in the manner of construction
and, further, that the contractors are not
doing the work according to the specifica
tion:: and plans. A committee from his
organization had called upon the Ciiy
Hall Commissioners and explained the
dereliction on the part of the contractors,
but that the Commissioners have not taken
any action in the premises and totally ig
nored the requests and suggestions of the
un ion's committee.
When this was explained to the Marble
cutteiÃ' Union ihe board of directors was
told to take up the matter and inform the
City Hall Commissioners that the union
as composed of citizens and taxpayers
would object to the contractors being paid
for such work. At the meeting of the
directors with the Commissioners the lat.
ter's attention was called to the work in
the lower floor of the rotunda as not being
fin ished in a workmanlike, first-class man
ner as required by the plans and specifica
tions. Still no good was effected by the
union's efforts.
Under tliese circumstances the direc
tors state that there is but one thing left
for them to do â bring the matter to the
attention of the Grand Jury for that body
to investigate.
The stand taken by the Marble-cutter's
was indorsed by the council.
Anoth-T matter in which City Hall con
tracts figure prominently was presented
to the council. It was the construction of
the City Hall roof. This subject has been
gone into thoroughly by tne members of
the United Roofers' Union and at a very
early stage of this work the union pro
tested aeainst the Commissioners having
the roof of concrete instead of iron. How
ever, the contract was Jet for concrete.
Since then the contractors have nut in
iron and on top of the iron concrete is be
ing laid.
The craftsmen of this calling declare
that within less than three years the
moist concrete will en t rust-holes through
the iron, and a leaky roof will be the j
result. At a meeting of this union the j
City Hall Commissioners were condemned
for the course they are pursuing with
reference to the roof.
The action of the metal roofers was in
dorsed. â¢
The Journeymen Butchers held their
regular meeting last evening in Crusader â 
Hall, Pythian Castle. There was a full a:- !
tendance. Arrangements are now being j
made for ihe annual excursion ol the as- j
soriation, and it was finally decided to I
hold it on the 2d of May at Agricultural
Park, near San Jose. At thÂ« same time
will be held a grand barbecue, the same as
last year.
On this occasion five whole cattle will
be cooked. Arrangements were settled so
far as this feature is conc^rne 1 at a meet
ing held last Tuesday evening.
The contract with the railroad com
pany for excursion rates has been signed.'
it it believed that Jour trains will be"
necessary to accommodate those who ex
pect to attend. Last year there were 3'XK)
people wh > went to Agricultural Park on
the Journeymen Butchers' Association
excursion from this City and Oakland

The committee of arrangements is com
posed of Chief Market Inspector Ben

CARNIVAL PREPARATIONS.
Native Sons and Daughter Will Cele
brate California Day.
A novel idea has been adopted by the
executive committee of the Carnival of
the Goldeu Gate. It is intended to strike
off medals of an elegant and appropriate
design, to be known as. the "Carnival
Medals of Honor," whicii will be awarded
to those who in tl c judgment of the com
mittee have done that which haa resulted
in the greatest pood.
Features of the celebration to be fur
nished by the Native Sons and Daughters
of the Golden West were discussed at a
meeting of the executive committee whicn
lasted until after midnight Wednesday.
The committee appointed by the carnival
convention of the two orders on Monday
night, consisting of Milton D. Garrett, J.
K. Hawkins, Sol Jacobs, Henry Lunstedt,
Henry Lansing, Mrs. H. M. Greene and
Mrs. Lena B. Mills, outlined the features
they intend to present.
Tuesday, May 4, will be known as 'â¢Cali
fornia day." The morning will open with
a grand parade of floats of all kinds, for
which the carnival committee has decided
to offer large cash prizes. These floats
will be manned by Native Sons. Native
Daughters will present the female charac
ters. Every important manufacturing
concern, the commercial, industrial and
financial interests will be represented by
float?, besides which there will be others
of a historical nature, depicting life from
early days up to the present time. For
the afternoon a number of novel projects
are well under way. In the evening a
grand ball will be given at the Mechanics'
Pavilion.
Henry 8. Martin, chairman of the
finance committee, is marshaling his
forces preparatory to an organized cam
paign in ihe business community. Vol
unteers from among the Merchants' Asso
ciation and other bodies are offering their
services to act as canvassers and collec
tors. Chairman Martin will be at carni
val headquarters from 4 to 5 o'clock daily,
to receive the reports ot his assistants.
SMALL NIPS OE DRAMS.
Dr. Chase Gave a Brief Temperance
Lecture in a Will Contest.
Dr. A. Chase of 192G Market street gave
a brief temperance lecture in Judge
Slack's court while testifying in the B. D.
Gripes will contest proceedings.
The physician said that tlie patient was
getting worse nnd a consultation of his
iriends was held, at which he told Mr.
Grisgs that he must quit drinking so
much intoxicating liquors.
" 'I was never drunk in my life,' indig
nantly replied the sick man.
"'Well, the constant takine of little
nips or small drams of liquor will para
lyze any man's stomaoii wnether he gets
drunk or not, and finally will kill bim.''
"How did your prognosis turn out in
this case!" asked Attorney Schell.
''We are here trying to settle up his es
tate," was the pnysician's crim and sen
tentious reply.
The estate of Grigga is not large, but
objection is made to having the property
go to persons outride of his list of rela
tives on the ground that undue influence
was exerted on him when he wrote his
will.

7CORBETT'S LIVER
IS ALL REGULAR
Big Jim Calls in a Doctor
to Pass Upon His
Condition.
Declared by the Medical Man to
Be as Sound as a Go d
Dollar.
Fiizrmmons Sore Over Reports That
H; Has Been Indulging in Too
Much L qaor.
CARSON*, New, March 4.â Big Jim Cor
bett professed 10 be considerably worked
up to-day over a story which has got
abroad to the effect that a part of his
training consists in doctoring himself for
a serious aff ctinn of the liver.
After he had finished swearing to him
self and indul mc in his customary gesti
culations Corbett sent a courier into Car
son with instructions to hunt up the best
doctor in town and bring him at once to
Shews Springs.
"Now, if this doctor knows his busi
ness," snapped Jim, "it won't take five
r.iinutes to convince the world that I am
not an invalid. That story orisinated in
San Francisco and I believe it was con
cocted for the purpose of affecting the
betting."
The messenger endeavored to get Dr.
J. W. Fox and several other prominent
physicians to attend Corbett but they
happened to be busy. He finally located
Dr. Guinan, whose ability is highly re
spected in Carbon, and that gentleman
readily consented ;o make the trip to the
springs.
The greeting between the physician and
. the champion was made quite formal by
the latter.
"Doctor," said Corbett, "I want you to
mate a thorough examination of me from
the crown of my heid to the soles of my
feet and I want you to speak right out if
you find anything the matter with me, no
matter how trifling the affection may be.
Now promise me that you will not be a
bit backward about this matter for I not
cnTy want ;o know myself, but I want the
whole world to know, and particularly my
friends."
Dr. Guinan promised and then those
present stepped back to watch the exam
ination. Ail was si'ence for at least twenty
minutes save for an occasional word from
the doctor commanding the big fellow to
inflate his lungs, or to do this and that.
Then the seance was over.
"Well," said Corbett with a triumphant
Bmile, for he could read in the physician's
lace the verdict.
"You are all right ; not a thing the mat
ter with you," said Dr. Guinan.
'You bet your life 1" was Corbett's re
joinder.
Subsequently the doctor made a more
detailed report of his investigation for the
benefit ot the newspaper correspondents.
"Corbeti is as sound as a dollar," he
said. "As a matter ot fact I never saw a
man in more perfect condition physically
than he. All of tiis organs are healthy.
His lungs are exceptionally pood and as
for his iiver it is in keeping with tne rest
ot his system. Nobody need worry about
that ruar.'s heaitb, and if that" is the
greatest requisite for a person going into
a prize fisht he is lit to give a first-class
account of himself."
Corbett was very much pleased over the
â¢way in which matters turned out. Not.
a* he explained to me, because of the doc
tor's verdict, for he expected that, but be
cause it would restore the confidence re
posed in him Dy his friends and backers.
â¢'Why, I never had any proof tuat I had
a liver," said the big iellnw. "much less
one that was diseased. I will say right
now and for keeps, that i have not been
doctor.ng for any kind of a complaint for
n year. I never had any sickness of any
consequence in my life. I don't want to
be understood as getting excited over any
f-tory that i 3 bruited aboui to the effect
that I am dying or a physical wreck, for I
realize that on account of the public posi
tion I am at present occupying, I must ex
pect adverse criticism, as well as that
which is favorable. Neither do I object to
ftories of this character being published ;
but I do insist upon beins given an oppor
tunity to inform my friends ai to my real
condition, and that is whj I sent into
town to-day for a doctor.
"You see thousands upon thousands of
dollars have alreaav been wagered on the
chances of my success in this contest and
thousands more will go up before the day
of ihe light. Now, ihe peopin putting up
this money are ail friends and admirers of
mine wuo have taken my word for it that
i am sound, am training faithfully and
intend to win. I don't want them to
thinK that I have been deceiving them,
and this is the only reason why f take the
troub c to prove that I h ave told the
truth."
Fitzsimmons, not to be outdone by Cor
bett, Is also out with a denial to-day.
Bob's bristles have risen over the reports
that he has been carousing the past few
evenings. He admits that he has placed
himself on the outside of a few swigs of
â¢whisky, but is up in arms over the story
that he was a fit subject for the Keeley in
stitute.
It has always been Fitzsimmons' custom
when training for any of his come-us to
treat himself to a good horn of Australian
grog every nigtit before retiring, and be
does not deny himself the pleasure of
sipping a bit of real old corn juice once in
a while during the day if he takes such a
notion. He claims that it never inierfered
with his training, and will have no bad
effects now.
"I know how that story got out," said
Fitzsimtuors this alternoon. "A few
nights ago I bought a bottle of whisky to
taJce out to the runch, and then went to
the telegraph office to send a message to
my wife. While there. I borrowed a cork

screw with which to open the bottle. There
were a number of people there at that
time, and some of them undoubtedly
divined richt away that I was going to lie
(iown in the gutter and soak myself with
the contents of the bottle. The story
possibly went from 'mouth to mouth, and
drew in proportions as it trnveled."
Dan Stuart issued an official proclama
tion to-day asking the world in general
not to believe any of the rumors about
either Corbett or Fitzsimmons being mint
to tight. He gives it out on his word as a
man and a square sport ti at both men
are in superb condition and training faith
fully. Dan took another sunning to-Jay,
waiting from his rooms to his headquart
ers on Carson street. He has grown quite
a little beard during his confinement.
He looked somewhat better than he did
yesterday, bin is still quite weak, and it
will doubtles-i be d:Â»ys yet before he will
be able to resume all of the duties that
fall upon the management. He only re
midnea at the office long enough to give
Secretary Wheeiocfc some instructions re
garding the srleof s?ats and then flurried
bacK to his apartments.
His physicians have given him permis
sion to remain out in the air but an hour
a day for the time being, but the allow
ance will be increased as he grows
s:ronger.
"I am satisfied to take my medicine,
even if it is severe," said ihe genial Texan
to-day, "but I want to be out on the 17th
of March. If I shoull have a relapse and
miss seeing the show I am to give I would
never cease kicking myself. iJut I gues*
i I'll be in the parade, and possibly in the
bandwagon at that. I Â»m getting the best
of care and do not propose to expose my
self any more than I can help."
Many of tfce citizens of Carson and the
visitors to this popular valley have been
indulging in some very tall kick- since
Martin Julian made an arrangement with
the proprietor of a livery-stab:e to carr>'
curiosity-stricken persons to and from
Cook's ranch at ?o much a head.
Under ordinary circumstances the tariff
would not be regarded as exorbitant for
the ride alone, but a coupon ticket whic h
is given to each patron oi the stage line
and admits him to Fitzsimrnons' gym
nasium for the regular afternoon perform
ance, ha 3 stirred up all the row. District
Attorney McGowan, accompanied by
Deputy Sheriff Nobloch, visited Bob'a
quarters this afternoon and ran against
Martin Julian, who was canying some
new punching bags from the house to the
pavilion, which serves as a gymnasium.
The District Attorney stated that under
tne laws of the S'.ate Julian should have
to pay a license fee.
"Well, cot your tickets?" asked the
dumpy little manager.
"What tickets" ?qieried McGowan.
Julian explained a bom the admission
fee, and then the District Attorney grew
warm in the region of his collar.
"1 didn't know thatyou had a menagerie
out here," he said, sarcastically. "So
people have to pay to coma in and look at
the kangaroo now. do they? Well, now
look here, young man; let me teil you
something that you didn't know, but that
will probably jar you a little. In this
county we have a law which requires all
persons giving exhibitions or shows where
an admission tee ia charged to take out a
license. It costs $20 a month. Now, the
Sheriff 8 representative is with me right
now and will act as a witness. I will
formally notify you now, as the attorney
for the county, that unless you cet out a
license betore to-morrow I will file a com
piaint and the whole works will be
pinched â Fitzsimmons, trainer, manager,
dog and all. Now this goes !"
Julian was dazed and dropped all of the
punching bags. "I'll see you in â well
some place â before I'll pay for any
license," he said with a snap of his teetu
after he had finally recovered from the
shock. "Why, confound it all, I'll shut
up the place and not let anybody in to --cc
Fitz before i'il have my leg pulled in this
fashion."
"Oh, do as you like," replied McQowan,
with a haucuty wave of his hand. "Put
your man in a glass case and keep him
there for all I care. I'm just telling you
what you have got to do if you want to
carry on this circus, and if you defy our
laws we will put you to a lot of trouble,
that's all."
Julian scratched his head and unloos
ened an idea. 'Say. Mr. District Attor
ney,'' he said, "I'm not giving this show
ior money. The livery man. who brines
out the visitors is the gentleman who
makes the charge." But this didn't work.
McGowan turned to the stablekeeper, who
happened to be at the ranch at the rime,
and that individual innocently confessed
before he had a chance to observe Julian's
wink that he and Fitzsimmons' manager
were dividing the gate receipts between
them. McGowan and the deputy then
waked off with triumphant swaggers, and
as a parting -hot invited Julian to ride
into town with them and they would in
troduce him to the license man.
AC.er the officials had gone Julian
called the liveryman aside and told him
he had better eet out the license to-ni3nt
as by being obstinate they would spoil a
eood thing. So Lanky Bob is not going
to be religiously exclusive after all.
Fitz found in his mail to-day a letter
containing a wishbone. The writer was a
woman residing in San Francisco and con
fessedly an ardent supporter of tne Oor
nishman. In her missive she informed
him tliat he must put the magic talisman
under his pillow and sleep on it every
mght up to the time of the fight. It he
carries out this instruction he cannot
possibly lose, slie declares. And in con
clusion she impressively reminds the
auburn-haired mumper that Napoleon
always paced a wishbone beneath his
pillow on the evening of all hli great
battles and in consequence was victorious.
Bob is not well up on history or he
might be tempted to ait down and ncratch
off a letter asking his San Francisco ad
mirer ii' Napoleon had a wishbone under
his pillow on the evening of Waterloo.
There was but little in the shape of
news out a: either of tfia training quarters
to-day save Julian's collision who the law.
Corbett went out for another road spin
and did some light work in the afternoon.
Mrs. Corbett and Jim's sister left for San
Francisco to-night chaperoned by Eddie
Cooke, the champion's press agent. The
departure of the ladies means that to
morrow James J. will have to get down to
hard work once more, that his little vaca
tion is over. In the morning he will
tramp eight or ten miles and then go
through the bae-punching exercise and
boxing. In the mternoon he will add a
little variety to his other work by spin
ning around the neighborhood on his bike
and playing handball.
The roads are now sufficiently dry and
free from snow to permit of bicycle-riding
and foot-racing. Fitz's day's|work com
prised his usual tramp over the hills near
Cook's ranch, sawing and chopping wood,
bagpanching, boxing, wrestling and then
a run into Carson. Both men are improv
inc in appearance every day.

ing lad, shorter than Hawkins, but more
stocky. He has a splendid record of vic
tories, his principal achievement being
the defeat of Frank Erne, the only fighter
who ever defeated George Dixon, the
world's champion of the feather-weight
class. Flaherty will train out at Genoa
in company with "Mysterious" Billy
Smith. The lad feels quite confident that
he will "put it on" Hawkins, but realizes
that he will have to do some fighting to
win, as he has heard something about
Dai's hitting powers.
Preparations are being made to give old
John L. Sullivan a lousing reception up n
his arrival in Carson. It will eclipse the
greetings of either Corbett or Fitznm
mons. A brass band has been secured and
instructed to play "Hail to theCUef" and
other selections "when the old gladiator
heaves into view. He will be plated in a

jyEMPSEi MS WRIQGLI>G.
DenieM 'Jhnt H< Sir/nrd a tttattment for
the ** Hxcluiive."
CARSON, Nev., March 4.âAssembly
man Timothy Dempsey of Carson is still
wriggling nnder the public tire for having
can -ed to be drawn up a bill asking the
Legislature to appropriate money for the
purchase of a championship belt to I c pre
sented to the winner of the Corbett-Fitz
simmons fi'bt.
Although D;mpsey would like to con
vince liia friends that lie was not serious
about the affair sti'l he has to admit that
he had the bill in his pocket and came
near introducing il last Tueaday. Denip
say denies that he signed any statement
for publication in which he is made to say
that he never caused such a bill to be
drawn up.
In connection with the belt story tne
Nevada State Journal, published at Reno,
look occasion in its issue of yesterday to
i oke a lot of lun at the Examiner-Journal
"exchmve" combination and twits it on
its ineffectual efforts to get a corner on
the news up here. Tiien, in conclusion, it
says: "In order to scoop the combine the
boys worked a scheme a day or two ago
and had a bill prepared in regular form
appropriating the sum of $10,000 for the
purchase of a champion belt to be pre
sented to the winner from the Silver
State. Timothy Dempsey, representative
of Orrasby County, had "been selected to
introduce the bill. Oi course it was ex
pected the bill would meet with immedi
ate opposition and possibly be rejected on
its first reading, but the boya f-imply
wante i to write up a story that the exclu
sive "Monarch" had not discovered, and
the scheme worked well and was tele
grnphed.
Tne Chronicle, Call, New York Herald
and othir papers came out the next morn
ing with important fight news, and the
Examiner-Journal did not have a line.
Their representatives were wild. They
made a rush for Dempsey and persuaded
him not to introduce the Dill, and wanted
him 10 sign a statement ihat he never
had the bill and that he bad no intention
of introducing such a measure. He con
sented to the first proposition, but refused
to sign a statement.
Tne Examiner men workei on him un
til late last ni^'ht, but he stood firm and
would not put his name to anything. Tne
boys had succeeded in making their scoop,
however, and gave a bit of news that the
'monarch" was twenty-four hours late in
mentioning.

BLUFFS AND SCIUIRMS AT
SACRAMENTO.
Produces Not a Word of Evi
dence in Support of Its
Bribery Charges.
FAILED IN AN EFFORT TO BOSS
THE INVESTIGATION.
Its Attorneys Used Insulting Lan
guage Before the Committea for
a Futi.e Purpose.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 4âAs
semblyman Caminetti acted in the role oi
major domo of the Examiner's fishing
excursion to-day and made a last effort to
save toe paper from being pilloried before
tne people of this State as a faker and a
llbeler of the "beyond a shadow of a
doubt" kind. In return for his kindly
meant but unsuccessful endeavor he was
insulted in the afternoon before the As
sembly investigating committee by A. J.
Clunie, who is a lawyer and thinks he is a
politician.
The Assembly committee had not been
in session an hour before It became evi
dent that the Examiner had not had a
particle of evidence on which its charge of
bribery had been made and that the whole
libel had been promoted by statements
made by Wiiliam T. Baggett, an attorney
for the Hale & Norcross people, while he
was chafa'ng over something that dis
pleased him.
He told Managing Editor Lawrence that
Mr. E'.choff had told him that some one
else had told Eichoff that they had heard
somebody say that there was a rumor
floating around to the effect that probably
money was used in securing the passage
af Caminetti's bill through the Legisla
ture. Without investigating the rumor,
and having nothing else but Baggett's
statement to depend upon, the Examiner,
in glowing headlines, charged Senators
and Assemblymen with having been
bribed. The charge was made in the most
direct and positive way, yet when Lawyer
Baggett testified before the committee to
day, he declared, under oath, that he did
not know that any money had bean used
â¢i An matter, directly or indirectly.
Not the slightest shred of a fact was
elicited to-day that would even lend color
to the charge made by the Examiner.
George A. Knight and Mr. Clunie made
considerable noise about what they pro
posed to do, and at times Mr. Clunie, by
his disrespectful manner toward the com
mittee, seemed to be invitine his own ex
pulsion from the room.
If this had been done it would have
been an excellent text for him and the
Examiner to have harped upon, and to
have pleaded that the committee did not
wish to allow the Examiner the benefit of
counsel. The committeemen, however,
kept their temper, even when Caminetti
rose from his chair and pluckily hurled
defiance into Mr. Clunie's teeth, although
Chairman Belshaw, Clarke, Mead and
Hill spoke very sharply to both Clunie
and Knight, and intimated that they
would not allow any subterfuges or any
straying away from the issue before the
committee.
Not having a pee to hang their case
â¢upon Clunie and Knight, the former a3
euming tbe role of senior counsel, beat the
air with their voices to divert attention
from their poverty of fact*. Ciunie T,an;ed
the Senate committee called in to sit in
joint session with the Assembly commit
tee. He seemed to want to do everything
that the committee did not want to do,
and to prove everything except the issue
on trial. He took the ground that the
Examiner was on trial, but that statement
was corrected by Brlshaw, who informed
Clunie that it was not the understanding
of the committee that the Examiner was
on trial.
Their object was to investigate charges
of bribery which bad appeared in that
paper in "its issue of February 27. They
proposed to interrogate the managing ed
itor and the correspondents of the Exami
ner to find out, if possible, the grounds
for publishing the iibelous article. If
they bad any facts to back up the charge
of bribery the committee wanted to know
there.
Knight remarked that while it might he
true tnat the Examiner was not on trial
that paper baa published an article of
sufficient Importance to draw the atten
tion of the Legislature to the facts pub
lished. Suppose that those facts could be
proved?
"You have to take one fact from one
witness and another fact from another,"
added Knight, industriously seekine to
enlarge the hole out of which be was try
ing to pull his client.
"Suppose we put the managing editor of
the Examiner on the stand, and bo should
say tbat he was in Los Angeles at the time
of the publication ol the article, and that
be knew nothing abont it? Or take the
correspondent here in Sacramento and put
him on the stand, and you should find
that what he knows was simply hearsay,
which would not be admissible as evi
dence, and therefore the Examiner might
be placed in tbe attitude of publishing
sometning that wÂ«Â»s not trne. The Ex
aminer atiouhl be allowed to take up tbe
case and step by step produce facts from
which you could reasonably conciude that
tlie statements made in the nrticie were
true. It is very seldom that you can gei
c man to go on tbe stand and confess that
he Has given or receved a bribe, bui. when
you find a man who cannot pay his board
b 11 being seen c'oseied vith n well-known
lobbyist and the next day he has money
to pay all his bills and thcow money away
you are justified in drawing an inference
from tl;at."
Hee Knight made a significant admis
sion, which caused every one in the room
to smile.
'â¢I know that the law is against ns," he
said, "in one way, inasmuch as the com
mittee has the right to pursue trie investi
gation in its own way. If it is the desire
of the committee to fin i out the truth, we
want to know i;."
"Don't you think that the burden of
proof in this matter lies with the Exam
iner?" asked Chairman Belsnaw.
'Suppose that the article is libelou*."
replied Knignt. "Suppose we take the
Dosuion that it is true and published with
good motives. Suppose we take the
position that it may not be :rue, but that
we believe It to be so, certainly we should
be ailow.d to determine the ways and
means and manner of producing the evi
dence."
"We want to get at the truth," ex
plained Chairman Belshaw, "and we want
to treat everybody fiirly, but we don't
want to be hampered by unnecas-ary work,
and we don't wan: anything that is not
strictly relevant to the case. We are in
the last part of the session, and we want
this matter finished before we adjourn.
The committee is in favor of giving the
Examiner every opportunity of proving
the chitree, and we want them to be as
brief as possible."
Knight replied that it would require ten
days lor ttie Examiner to present its case,
and Cutiie urged that it wouid save time
if both committee* would sit together.
Belshaw announced that the chairman
of ihe Senate committee had sent him
word that the Senate committee preferred
to hold separate sessions. It wouid sit In
the evenings, while the Assembly com
mittee wouid hold day sessions; each
committee was inquiring as to the charge
made against ite own branch of the Leg
islature.
Knight had another trial at the matter.
He said that he had been in the Senate
when the resolution came up and was
voted down, practically denying the Ex
aminer to take ihe investigation out of
the hands of the committee and run it in
its own way. He and his client had a
right to look upon the Senate committee
as hostile.
"One moment, if you please," inter
rupted Chairman Belshaw, "I don't
think that this committee will allow the
Examiner to conduct its investigation,
ana I want it understood that tnis com
mittee, and not t lie Examiner, is conduct
ing this investigation."
"You don't know whether those charges
are true or not," bluffed Clunie, "we
come here to ahow that they are true, and
you won't have it; I want to quit."
"I don't care what you want to do," re
torted Mr. Belshaw, "but we don't want
you to conduct the examinations."
Hill said that the affair was simply an
investigation and that the Assembly com
mittee had extended to the Examiner the
courtesy of being represented by counsel.
"We want to t;et through as quirkly as
possible and we don't pronose to ahow
any fishing excursions. We wiil allow
you to cross-examine any witnesses so
long as you don't interfere with the legiti
mate progress of the examination. We
don't care what the Senate committee may
do in the matter."
Knight's superb gall protruded itself
once more through the environment. Ho
raid: ''We must do one thing o; - tha other.
We have the laboring oar to prove this
matter to be uup, or we have no business
here at all. The Examiiur peop.e are
here and represented by their counsel,
and if this committee desires to investi
gate this affair th- Examiner must have
exclusive control ot the investigation.
We want the exclusive right of introduc
ing testimony in the linÂ« oi establishing
the tru-.h of tne statements made in the
article, otherwise I don't see how we can
proceed."
After considerable more of this kind of
bluff, which led the spectators 10 believe
that the Examiner mi^ht have some evi
dence up its sleeve. Lawyer William Bag
gett of San Francisco, tne fountain head
ot the iitelous article, was called to the
stand.
The witness swore that he was an attor
ney for the plaintiff in the Hate it Nor
eross suit, anl h-j came to the conclusion
tJiat Mr. Caminetti's bill very seriously
affected that case. It was an attempt to
disqualify the Judge sitting in that case
in tne event of it beinor sent bact from
the Supreme Court. He heard last Wednes
day or Thursday of the bill, and he at
once net. tied bis friends and went to the
Examiner editorial rooms and called Mr.
Lawrence's attention to the bill, giving
the opinion that he, Baggett, considered
it an indirect attack on Judge Hebbaru.
On the following day, as a result of that
sweet communion of spirit, an editorial
was born in the Examiner calling atten
tion, in accordance with Baggett's opinion,
to the demerUsof the bill. Apparently
the editorial was not strong enougn, or did
not come before the eves of a sufficient
numoer of people, for Mr. Baggeit went
un a new trail and used his ears. He
heard a day or two after that that money
was being used, or would be used. "I
think,"Â» he added, "that the amount
named was that they were paying $750
apiece for vote? in tho Senate. Mr. Eah
koff, an attorney in San Francisco, in
formed me that that was what he had
heard."
Mr. Baggett, after surprising the commit
tee by tehing what he had heard Mr. Eioh
koff say about what he had heard some
where unknown and from some one un
named, immediately reported to his ally
that he bad heard that $750 was being paid
or offered for votes in the Senate.
On the following week he came to Sac
ramento and met Major Gillis just outside
the Golden Eagle Hotel. "He made a
surmis?," continued Mr. Baggett, "that I
had come up here in the interest of that
bill, and he told me that there was no use
in trying to do anything; that the matter
was fixed. 'There is money in this thing,
and unless you are ready to put up some
money you are gone,' said the Major."
"I said," continued Mr, Baggett, his
bosom swelling with unwonted emotion:
'Major, if it would cost me only 15 cents
to stop the passage of the bill I would not
pay it.' "
This remark produced a marked im
pression upon the audience, and E. J.
Smith wiped his eye with his cuff.
"At that time," resumed Mr. Baggett,
"The bill was on the Senate file."" He
(Baggett) went on to tell how he had gone
to different Sentors to lobby against the
bill. He found that Senator Morehotise
had'madea motion tbat the bill should
be denied a thud reading, and the motion
was defeated by a vote of 15 to 18. He
found also tbat Senator Stratton had
voted against Morehouse'Â» motion. Sena
tor Ben told him that he had promised to
vote for the bill. Tuere wee 20 votes in
the Senate in favor of the bill, which was
one leÂ»<Â» than rhe constitutional majority.
Senator Moreliouse voted aye on tbe
passage of the bill and some one else came
in and voted aye, so that there was one
vote more than a majority. Baggetc re
marked to Morehou:-e that he must have
voted aye for the purpose of giving notice
of a motion to reconsider. Senator More
house denied that such had been his in
tention. Then Baggett suggested that as
tbe bill had won b^ o.ily one vote outside
of Morehouse's it could be defeated on the
next day. Morehouse replied that it
could not te done.
Baggett confessed this made him dis
heartened and discouraged. He went out
into the hal.way and met Attorney Mor
gen-tern, whom he infomed that the bill
bad passed, ani he had heard in San
Francisco that money was used to carry
the bill and that the price in the Senate
whs $750 a vote, but that no definite charge
had been made agninst anybody. Mor
gensterr replied: "Well, your story is all
right, but the amount is wrong. The
price was not $750, but was much less
than that, and I know tbe precise
amount."
"I said to Major Gillis: 'Major, you
staled yeaterdav about money being vied
up there. Can you give me any item as
to who distributed the money and who
got it?' "continued Baegeti. "Gillis said, 'l
don't know that any money was used.' "
Here Clunie twisted the witness into an
irrelevant realm. "I und-rstand," he
asked, "that in the course ol your prac
tice in this Hale & Norcross case money
bad been used in a dozen different way's
to defeat Jud-e Hebbard in the elecion ?"
Hill inquired whether that could affect
this case of bibing legislators, and on
being informed that it would not he ob
ject- d to the testimony.
Belshaw asked, "Does the witness know,
directly or indirectly, of any money being
used in the Assembly in favor of or against
this bill."
"I do not," replied Bsgeetr.
"fc that all you know abont the matter
under investigation?" asked Hill.
"Tnat i 3 all," replied Baggett, and the
man who had used the' Examiner to vilify
the Legislature left the stand.
Alvinza Hayward, tbe next witness,
slid he had been interested in the Hale <fe
Norcross mine some live or six years ago.
Clunie tried to makÂ« it appear that Mr.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 5, 1897.
Hay ward and Senator Voorheis were as
thick together as Andy Lawrence and
William Baggett, but the attempt failed.
Mr. Hay ward frankly stated that up to
a year or two ago he had assisted Senator
Voorhei-t in his political ambition, but he
did not do so in the last campui^n.
Clunie asked whether Mr. Hay ward did
not send word to ihe mines to have the
men vote for or against certain candi
dates, and Mr. Hay ward made a flat
denial of the insinuation. The most he
had ever done was to speak favorably of
any friend of his who might be running
for oflice.
Be shnw asked the direct question, il Did
you ever send up word to your men to
VOie for Mr. Voorheisf"
"No, sir," replied the witness
"Have you ever given Senator Voorheis
any money?" asked Clunie.
"No, air; not a dollar in my lifÂ«. ' '
Hill a*ked what had Senator Voorheis'
election to diwith the subject matter of
tne investigation, and the question gave
Clunie an opportunity of adopting the
tactics of his client and throwing out an
insiniiation, under the guise of a hypo
thetical ca*e, that if Mr. Hay ward had a
bill in view to be introduced at this ses
sion, tie might have loaned Senator Voor
heis $1000 or $2000 during the campaign.
This was in iine with the conduct ot the
detenso all through the investigation. It
was always what might have been, but
never what was.
Mr. Hay ward was asked whether he had
ever had any correspondence with Benator
Voorheis during the last election cam
paign, and he replied that he bad not,
and that he never had any corre
spondence with the Senator in relation to
Assembly b;ll 273.
Attorney Morgenstern wns next on the
stand. He gave quite a different veraion
of things from that relatod by Mr. Baggett.
He said that Baggett appeared to be very
much discouraged because lie had come
up too late to defeat the bill. He told
Morgen stern that the people to whom he
had spoken had already made up their
minds to vote for the bill. Baggett said
that he understood that the boys got a
certain amount of money for voting on
the bill, and that some of them had not
got their money. "I would like to have
this thing reopened," said Baggett, "so
that those who didn't get their money
could come in, and you had better see
them."
Morgenstern replied to this invitation
that he had no interest whatever in the
matter, but that he would do what he
could to help his disconsolate friend Bas;
gett. He understood that Baggett had
said that certain men bad been raid for
votes, or for keeping quiet on the bill, and
the witness had said that he had heard
.that ihe amount was not the same as that
stated by Baggett, but that it was another
amount.
"Do you know that any money was paid
to any Assemblyman?" asked Hill.
"No, sir," was the reply.
"To any Assemblyman or to any Sen
ator? '
"No, sir, and I don't believe that any
was paid."
Morgenstern added that after the libel
appeared in the Examiner these rumors of
bribery became prevalent.
"You kept a file of those bills and
watched them all in the interest of the
people? ' asked Ciunie, with a sneer.
"Yes, sir; in the interest of the peopie,"
was the reply. In reply to a question he
said that the bill was slipped through
vÂ«ry slick without attracting much atten
tion. He did not believe that any money
was used. Money wns always raw, crude
work.
Major George B. Gillis, the hero of
forty-nve years' experience in legislative
life, was the next witness. He said that
he told Bagu-ett that he could not beat the
bill without coin, and That he (Qillis) bad
heard that it was sometimes a handy
thing to have coin around when a bill was
to be defeated.
He told Baggett at (he same time that
he was as handy a man as Mr. Baggett
was, but that he, Giilis, could not do any
thing to stop the bill. Giilis had talked
with Senator Morehouse, and the Senator
said that he thought he would vote
against the bill. On the next day he voted
for it. Tnere had never been a money
proposition in any transaction he had
ever had with any members of either
bouse.
Clunie here offered to prove the truth of
the Examiner libel in so far as the Senate
was concerned, and as he hod expected
Chairman Belshaw replied that they were
not investigating the charges against the
Senate. The Senate bad a committee of
its own for that purpose. They were sim
ply investigating the charges against the
Assembly.
Mead made a clever hit when he said:
"Mr. Clunie offers to prove before the As
sembly committee that the Senate has
been bribed-. Now I will ask him if he in
tends to offer before t:.e Senate committee
to prove that the Assembly was bribed?
Judge Filet of Aiameda was called to
the stand for the purpose of provins that
he was acquainted with George W. Baker.
He said that Baker was attorney lor the
Liquor-dealers' Association, and that that
association desired the passage of Cami
netti's bill because he had found many
Justices of tbe Peace, in prohibition dis
tricts where the anti-liquor sentimentwas
strong, were prone to b6 swayed by bias.
Clunie apparently lost his head at this
revelation and he asked a whole lot of
questions having no foundation, in fact,
but designed to make an effect upon the
unthinking. He tried to make it appear
that there had been bad feeding between
tfr.ker and Judge Frick, but signally
failed.
Frank Jayne?, superintendent of the
Western Union Telegrap . Company, was
asked by Clunie to produce all dispatches
that miebt have passed between Mr. Hay
ward and Senator Voorneis, and Mr.
Baker and Judge Frick.
Mr. Jaynes replied that he would pro
duce them if they wpre specified. Knight
wanted the whole office, but the commit
tee directed Mr. Jaynes to bring three
<li-patches which were not relevant to the
ca>e.
Assemblyman Caminetti, the next wit
ness, said that he Knew nothing whatever
of the charges of bribery. He introduced
the bill after considerable stody. He
knew that the Liquor-dealers' Association
wanted the bill and that Air. Baker repre
sented that association. He never had
any conversation with Lane or Hayward
abo.u the bill. "I never spoke to a single
Assemblyman about tbe bill, and never
asked anybody to support it."
Caminetti said that he had seen many
instances in which the law would be an

Clunie. Â
"I don't need any justification, re

Then he rose from hii chair and looking
Clunie straight in the eye challenged him
with the words: "If you want to say any

"Do you know of any member ot the

SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 4.â lt was
a bad day ali around for the "new journal
ism" faker on the Senate side of the Legis
lature to-day. The formal investigation
of the sensational and calumnious charges
contained in the Examiner of the 27th
was begun by the Senate committee. .But
preceding the investigation proper, before
the committee, there was an exciting pre
lude in the Senate itself.
Realizing the extreme weakness and
danger oi its position, the Examiner saw
tit to secure the services of two able at
torneys to conduct its side of the inquiry
in the persons of George A. Knight and
Andrew J. Clunie.
The evening session was opened by
Senator Dickinson stating the object of
the investigation. Attorneys Geor :e A.
Knight and Andrew J. Clunie were present
to represent tue Examiner.
Clunie made another transparent stiff
biuff at wanting certain witnesses subpe
naed, naming them. Dickinson said that
would be a matter f'.-r consideration to
morrow. As a matter of fact, however,
the witnesses mentioued by Clunie have
already been subpenaed by the committee.
Adjournment was taken until 7:30 o'clock
to-morrow evening, so as not to conflict
witu the hearing before the Assembly
committee, which is to be held in the
morning and afternoon.

aelf-respect that it may still claim to
possess. >
Using Senotor Doty as its instrument it
had tne following resolution submitted to
the Senate:
Whereas. The Daily Examiner of San Fran
cisco lo'lts issue of February 27, 1897, pub
lished an article reflecting upi>n the honor
and integrity of members of the Legislature of
this State; and whereas, a committee h&s b^en
heretofore appointed by this Senate for the
purpos-- of Investigating such charges; and
whereas, the object of the Senate iv the ap
pointment of such committee was to enable
the Examiner to mlly present in its own man
ner a:l evidence reluting to said charges, in
order that the truth or falsity might be deter
mined; now therefore b_- it
Resolved. Ttiat. the said committee so ap
pointed be and they are hereby instructed
and directed to permi*. the Examiner to appear
before it and participate in the proceedings
bycouuselof its selection, and that all sub
penas required or requeued by said Examiner
for witnesses be grante 1 both for persons and
?Â»apers, tind that said Examiner be permitted
b prosecute such charges in such manner as
its counsel may determine, both a* to the man
ner and order of proof and the wituesses re
quired.
Senators Smith and Simpson opposed
its adoption and Senator Androus offered
the following substitute:
Whereas, Many of the witnesses required In
the investigation" ol the charges heretofore
published by the San Francisco Examiner are
non-residents of and absent from the county
oi .Sacramento, &a<t on. accou.it ol the short
period ot time remaining ol the present
session H will be impossible to secure their
attendance, and it Is essential that if any In
vestigation be bad that the same mould be
full Hnd exhaustive, therefore be it
Resolved, That the committee heretofore ap
pointed for the investigation of such ih .rgÂ«s
be recalled and discharged and that the Grr.nd
Jury of tne county of Sacramento be requested
to institute a full inquiry into all matters con
cerned in said charges.
Senator Dickinson, chairman of the
bribery investigating committee, declared
that the resolutions were uncalled ior,
as no action had been taker, by the com
mitte?, and that the author of the original
re solution should at least have waited un
til the co mmittee by its course had shown
the need of being instructed and con
trolled by the Examiner. He said the
only issue was to show whether the Senate
was guilty or innocent of the charges
made against it, and that there was no at
tempt to punian any one. It was simply
desired, he said, to nnd out if it were true
that Senators had been bribed. In con
clusion ho said: "I am satisfied that the
committee will do Us duty properly and
satisfactorily to ail concerned.' 1
Senator Morehouse, who was the gentle
man who set the investigation on foot,
showed his courage and nice sense of
honor and jus^ce In his remarks opposing
the resolutions". HfÂ» said :
"I hope that the substitute will be voted
down. It would be cowardly on the part
of the Senate to take any such course.
The charges which have been made
against members of this Senate have been
positive and specific, and I am informed
Dy the attorneys of the San Francisco Ex
aminer that ti ey have the proof, that
they are prepared to present it, ana that
ihey ara here to appear before this com
mittee of the Senate this afternoon ; that
t> ey have witnesses here, and that they
are ready and willing to go into this ex
amination, and all that they ask is that
they be permitted to be represented by
counsel. I believe that what the?e attor
neys have stated is true and I will name
the counsel â my* friend, George A. Knight,
and Andrew J. Clunie.
"Why then should it be turned over to
the Grand Jury to have a whitewash? We
have plenty of time. Why should we
back out? If there is any truth in these
charges it should be shown who is guilty,
and then we can turn the matter over to
the Grand Jury.
"It there is no truth in these charges,
then we should teach this great journal
that this Senate cannot be slandered with
impunity.
"Butlhavo just learned from the Ex
aminer people that they are ready to go
on and are ready to produce the proof.
Now. under these circumstance?, shall we
iall down like a lot of whipped curs, or
shall we stand here like men of honor, in
tegrity and courage, I liodb that this
cowardly substitute will be defeated.
"I know that every honorable member
of this Senate wants a lull investi ation,
an honest investigation and a fair investi
gation, and I want the stigma of dishonor,
if there be any, to fall on '.nose who de
serve it."
Withington declared that he was not
only opposed to both resolution*, but to
ti.e entire investigation. He said he did
not believe there was any necessity for
one, because the charge* had appeared in
the Examiner, and every one in the State
knew tnat "there was no relation between
its news columns and the proceedings
which take place here."
Maboney was in favor of allowing the
Examiner counsel, so that it would have
no opportunity of saying it had not had a
fair hearing.
Pedlar opposed both resolutions, and
Dwyer favored Doty's proposition.
Androus explained that the reason he
offered the substitute was to relieve the
Senate of the responsibility of the investi
gation.
Simpson showed the inexpediency of
referring the matter to the Grand Jury.
He said :
"I remember two years ago, we had an
experience with the Sacramento Grand
Jury in the scandal of Biggy and Dunn
It was referred to the Grand Jury and that
was the last we heard of it. I don't pro
pose to lie down and crawl before any
newspaper and allow those charges to go
uninvestigated and go broadcast all over
the United Stnte* unchallenged while wo
lie supinely on our backs.
"No retractions of these charges have
been made. The charges were positive
that members of the Senate had been paid
from $3jO to $500 ana members of the As
sembly $150. They were positive und di
rect. Tiie following day they were trying
to hedge, and they came down a lltt'.e In
the number who were bribed, and they
said it amounted to leas than a dozen. Is
that a retraction of the charge?
"IsbaUhang my head in shame, even
thou h I was not one of those who voted
for the measure, if we drop those charges
at this time and allow that paper or any
other paper to dictate to this august body
the manner in which this investigation
shall be conducted."
Senator Smith moved to lay the whole
matter on the table.
Dickinson informed the Senate that at a
meeting oi his committee last night it was
decided to allow the Examiner counsel,
and declared that if the Doty resolution
was adopted there would be no use for the
committee, ns it would have no power.
Simpson offered an amendment to strike
out in the original resolution the words
"in such manner as its counsel may de
termine, both as to the manner and order
of proof and the witnesses required,"
which concludes the resolution.
The motion to lay on the table was put
and lost, and the amendment of Simpson
was adopted.
Smith denounced the resolution as a re
flection on the fidelity, integrity and abii
ity of the committee and said tne Exam
iner should not be allowed to give the com
mittee instructions.
Bulla reiterated Smith's views, and
added: "If I were a member of the com
mittee and this resolution were adopted I
would feel justified in resigning."
The resolution when placed be.orn the
Senate was carried by almost unanimous
vote.
And thus ended the Examiner's first at
tempt to shield itself by raising the cry of
"thief" against others.

SEE YUPS APPEAL
TO WASHINGTON
Attorney Campbell Will Go
to the Capital on
Monday.
Influential Merchants Will Ac
company Him to See the
Minister.
Tiie American Government to Bo
Asked to Interfere to Save
Prisoners in China-
Attorney J. C. Campbell, who Is con
ducting the case of the See Y'up Society
against Fong Yuen Hing, the Chinese
Consul, for breaking up their headquar
ters, will go to "Washington, D, C, on
Monday, to lay the matter personally be
fore the Chinese Minister.
It has transpired since the troubles be
tween the Sam Yups and See Yups began
that a number of the relatives of the
members of the latter organization have
been imprisoned because of their partici
pation in the boycott.
The See Yups claim that they have been
guilty of no conduct that should merit
punishment to their relatives in China,
and that the whole- matter has been placed
m its present condition by the action of
tho Chinese Consul in sending reports
adverse to the See Yups 10 the imperial
representative at Washington.
Nine influential members of the See
Yup Society will accompany Mr. Camp
bell, and it is understood that an effort
â will be made to induce the American Gov
ernment to interfere to effect the release
of the prisoners in China.
Mr. Campbell will take many important
documents relating to the case with him,
and expects to make such a showing as
will speedily settle the matter.
The examination of Fong Ynen Hing
was resumed before United States Com
missioner Heacock yesterday, and he pro
duced documents tending to show that
many complaints from all parts of the
.^tate asking that the boycott be raised
had been received.
He admitted that he wanted to break
up the See Yup Society, saying that this
â¢was the only Ihing that would insure
peace in Chinatown.
The hearing was adjourned until Satur
day, when Chief Crowley will be called
upon to testify as to the efforts that the
Consul made to have him break up the
See Yup Society by wrecking its head
quarters and dispersing its members.
Tne See Yups say that the Chief refused
to do this even after an indemnity of $10,
--000 was offered him, on the ground that
no indemnity would cover an illegal acl.

the complications resulting from the ex

Spirited Tug-01-War Contests in
Mechanics' Pavilion Last
Night
The Irish Team Did Not Pull Because
Its Anchorman Was Not in
Condition.
The attendance at the tug-of-war last
evening was very good. In fact, the Pa
vilion must have held 3000 people when
the sport commenced, and tha excitement
was intense at times when the struggles
were brisk.
The pool-sellers did a rushing business
as the friends of the teams that contested
who wagered on the contest were sanguine
of success. . This evening some very good
sport is promised.
The Irish team did not appear last even
ing. The captain said that his anchor
man was not in lit condition and could
not therefore pull.
The Irish were booked to meet the
Scotch team and the last named appeared
upon the platform ready for action. The
judge awarded them the contest by de
fault and reprimanded the Irish team for
its refusal to go on with the match.
The â¢ second event of t lie evening was
between the Norwegian and Italian teams.
The betting was in favor of the Italians at
$3 to $1 50 and' at those figures ' consider
able money went into the pool box.
The men from far away Norway won the
contest in 5 mm. 30 sec.
The Swedish and German teams came
next. The Swedes were strong Javoritan,
selling at 2to 1, and the small end was
hard to find. But when the Germans
gained seven cleats the pools changed
with the Swedes selling favorites at 5 to 3.
But It was a Swedish victory. Time, 15
minutes.
Daring intermission two teams of boys,
the Knob Hill Sports and Hayes Valley
Tigers, bad a spirited straggle, which was
won by the Sports in 9 minutes.
The French and Danish teams then
facod each other, the betting being $5 to
$l\4 in favor, of the Danes. The Danes
finally won the struggle, which was the
best of the evening, in 20 mm.* 46 sec.
* The last contest of . the evening was be
â  tween the United States and Canadian
teams. The betting was $5 to $2, with the
Canuckson the short end.
. The Americans were the first to secure
â¢an advantage,' and in exactly 1 minute
54 seconds they won the victory, amid
great cheering.

THE IRISH HONOR
EMMET'S MEMORY
Knights of the Red Branch
Give an Entertain
ment.
The Patriot's Anniversary Cele
brated at Metropolitan
Hall.
Programms of Music and 0:a ory, to
Which Father Yorke and the
Mayor (Jpntr.bute.
Metropolitan Hall was the scene of an
enthusiastic gathering last night in honor ;
of one of Ireland's most celebrated martyrs
ai;d patriots, Robert Emmet, who sacri
ficed his life for his country.
The hall was gorgeously decorated with
emblems everywhere and always asso- j
ciated with Emmet's nationality, such as j
the Irish harp, the "shamrock bo treen," j
and a profusion of bunting and foliage of
the same color. A fine portrait of the
patriot hung in front of the large organ,
and beneath it were the words: "His
epitaph shall be written."
Above the stars and stripes floated tri
umphantly, as if to emphasize the friend
ship of the two countries.
The entertainment was given under the
auspices of the Knights of the Red
Branch, and the evening's musical pro
gramme was exclusively composed of
Irish solo?, whether instrumental or vocal.
The oratorical flavor was contributed 'by
Mayor Phelan, who as chairman of the
evening delivered a brief but inspiring in
troductory address, and by Rev. Eeter C.
Y'orke.
The programme in full was as follows:
Organ prelude, National airs, Miss Marie
Georgiana; introductory, by the chairman,
Uon. James D. Fhelan ; quartet, "Come Back
to Erin" (Cottelli), Miss Roney, Mrs. Grittin,
Messrs. Desmond and lierjter; tenor solo, "The
Minstrel Boy" (Moore), J. H. Desmond; con
tralto solo, "hmmet's Last Words," Mrs.
Thomas Griffin; violin selections, "Bohemian
Girl" (Balfe), Senor Jose Andonetjui; soprano
solo, "Last Rose of Summer" (Moore). Miss
Annie Roney; barytone solo, "The Memory ot
the Dead" (Ingram), G. Berger; oration, Rev.
Peter C. Yorke; quartet, "God Save Ireland"
(Sullivan), Miss Roney, Mrs. Griffin, Messrs.
Desmond and Berger.
The platform was occupied by vice
presidents and other officers of the society
in addition to the two speakers of the
evening.
In the course of his address Mayor
Phelan said:
To-night we are assembled to celebrate one
of the birthdiiys of human freedom. One
hundred and more years ago the struggle for
American independence inspired the French,
the Irish and other peoples to hope that they
might accomplish a similar result and a spirit
of revolution was foremost in the minds of
men. To-day we find the forces of freedom
gathering again, and in ancient Greece, in
Crete and In Cuba the genius of Independence
has sounded a call to arms. Ireland is
quiescent, with the quiescence of a volcano,
ready at the slightest provocation to burst
into activity, for the Irish arc a Itbert3--loving
people suffering under an alien and vicious
rule without their free and full consent.
We know from the history of freedom
thai emancipation has co:Â»e to nations from
wrong and oppression only by persistent pro
test, by tireless resistance and that content
ment and peace in a political sense are only
theportion of slaves. Ireland has on the altnr
of her country aad of freedom sacrificed some
of her noblest sons, who have for her sake
gone willingly to the scaffold, aad no country
which has made such sacrifice*, or produced
such sons, can fail to accomplish her ultimate
purpose. The rate of Roberi Emmet has not
only made Ireland's cause glorious and sacred,
but it has made it invincible. For over a hun
dred years the memory of Kmmet has been an
inspiration to the people, just as his dying
words riave boon a command. He has made
Irish patriotism not merely a sentiment,
not a mere passing ebullition of feeling
and enthusiasm, but he has made Irish pa
triotism a living creed and, if I say it, an un
performed duty, and any pther view would
make every Irishman an abettor and a con
niver at his fate. Emmet gave up everything
âyouth, hope, love, ambitionâ to serve that
green isle which had nourished him and upon
which he had proposed to comer the dignity
of independence and to her sons the privi
leges and the rights of freedom. That was
the crime for which he died and that is the
reason we are here to-night to celebrate his
memory.
Father Yorke, whose rising was the sig
nal for prolonged applause, said :
Who fears to speak of '93 ? [Cheers.] After
100 years of sorrow and stress and strife, here
Iroin the ends of the earth, in a new world,
that question goes out in defiance to tyranny.
Who fears to speak of '98 ? A hundred years
ago, wheu the men who rose in dark and evil
days were put down by treachery, by might,
by blood and fire, in the prison cell and on
the scaffold, they thought â ever thought â that
liberty was buried. But liberty never dies;
the battle of freedom is never lost; Its defeats
are its victories, and the scui and grandsons
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 5, 1897.
of the men of '98 are here to-night to ask that
question: Who fears to SDeak of '98? Who
blushes at tne name T
It is, ladies and gentlemen, an ennobling
thing that we should meet here year after
year to celebrate the memory of the mighty
dead. It is an uplifting thine for the heart of
man thai at stated limes he should turn away
his mind from business cares and from ma
terial pursuits in order that lie mÂ«y consider
the mighty men of old, their deeds, and the
legacy which they huve left unto us. To-day
is an anniversary which appeals to every
heart.
It is the annivorsnry of a man in whose life
patriotism and romance are blended. It is
the anniversary of a youth â a boy, we might
almost sayâ who gave xxv his life in order that
his country might be free, and who sacrificed
Ins lust chance of escape iv order that he
might say iarewell to the girl he lovel. He
lived for his loves, says the poet; for his
country ne died. He died, a glorious, a brave,
a heroic figure, a ligure to which the young
may look aud spein it no spot or stain ; a figure
to which the old may look and pray that God
may give them sons like him.
When the struggle was inaugurated on this
continent a few years before the birth of Rob
ert Emmet â so mat he might be said to have
been cradled in the arms of libertyâ the feel
iug of National independence was aroused in
the Bleeping sons of Ireland, and they com
pelled the English Parliament at the mouth
of the cannon of the volunteers to give one
small installment of liberty, sma.l as it was,
the liberty of a faction to make laws Jor the
whole nation, it was a liberty too large for
England's comfort. Ttiose who speak of Eng
land's greatness are direful never to teil you
how tier dominion was aiquirred; how her
power was obtained. Tney are careful never
10 teil of an island side Dy side with England,
which has been robbed and plundered for (500
years in order that England might grow great
and. powerful.
She. sits upou her throne, great, it is true,
among the princes of the earth, but she is
drunk wltb the blood of the stunts, and her
coffers are enriched by the plunder of tne
poor.
The act of union was passed by treachery
and fraud and by playing upon the religious
feelings of the two great bodies into which
Ireland was divided. An attempt has been
made to introduce the same system into our
country, and in our day, but, God, it
has tailed. We have learned wisdom by the
misfortunes of the past, aud we Know
that the introduction of religious ques
tions, no mailer Irom what quarter, lino
secular politics, is an infamous design oi those
who hate tlie people and who would deprive
them of their liberty, and it is an earnest of
the cool s'-nse of the people that such an at
tempt has been crusned out with universal
scorn and tiiat those who strove to do it snail
go clown to prosterity with the names of Judasl
Emmet fulled in his effort to effect arising
and establish a provisional government
through treachery; he was tried, convicted
and hanged. It is not the rim time that thu
gallows has become the inspiration of liberty;
\ nor the lirst Ume that men when dying have
won their causes. Emmet's life and death,
his sacrifice for the good of his country, for
the liberation of a people, for the last hope of
repeal of the cursed union, is to us a standard
aud a signHl to winch we may turn our eyes
and vow our vows that we, too, as far as in us
lies, may do something for the cause oi human
rights aud fur the freedom of the land irom
which our race is sprung.
There are those who, to their shame be it
said, have taken the festival oi Ireland's
: apostle â the symbol of our iaith, of our na
tional gloryâ and have made it, in order to
make more money, the uav oi a brutal prize
fight. There are men who, in order to attract
audiences and to Stir up National sentiment
I which should never have been mentioned or
I degraded to such a depth, have put themselves
forward as men of Irish Mood" in their veins
and have taken the Irish flag to ma&e it the
breechiloui of a prize-lighter! Oh! that flag
for many a year has floated over the vanguard
of the battle; it has gone down into the dust
and its green folds have been dyed with the
blood of its own children, but never before
has it been disgraced or degraded.
This is the disgrace that cannot be washed
out; this is the degradation against which
every Insn heart protests. Every one of you,
I appeal to you, men and women of Irish
bloodâ you don't favor this. You condemn it;
you reprobate it; you lift up your voice ana
say to the world you hnve neither hand nor
part in such infamy; for if you had It were
better that the name of Ireland and the name
of the Irish should be blotted out forever Irom
the annals of human history.
in conclusion, the speaker rapidly
traced the advances made by the Irish
people in the direction of freedom during
the present century, and prophesied the
not distant day when the aspirations of
every patriot would be realized.
WILL MAKE A TEST CASE.
The Coroaer Determined to Have
Oakley's Personal
Effects.
Body of the Dead Millionaire Shipped
East, the Stomach Beicg
Held for Analysis.
Coroner Hawkins will make a test case
of the legal difficulties over the effects of
John M. Oakley, the Pittsburg million
aire who died at toe Palace Hotel on Tues
day evening presumably from the effects
of over-indulgence in champagne.
When the Deputy Coroner, who was put
on the case, made a demand for Oakley's
effects he was told he could not have
them and that the management did not
recognize his right to demand them.
Justice Barry, the only Magistrate who
couid be found at short notice, ' was ap
pealed to and issued a search warrant
calling for the trunk and valise of the
deceased. On this warrant the trunk and
valise were turned over to the Police
Department and are now in the custody of
the property clerk.
The keys to them were given to the
Coroner's deDUty, but all other articles
were kept. Coroner Hawkins has learned,
so he says, that there are valuflOle papers,
securities and a considerable sum of
money that belonged to Oakley in the
j safe of the hotel, and these he is
I mined to have with the rest of the effects.
The case came up before Justice Barry
yesterday morning, but it was continued.
Tne legal firm of L a nnon & Hawkins,
which represents the Coroner, will make
a bitter fight to have the Coroner's rights j
to the possession of the effects of persons
whose cases come under his jurisdiction
determined.
"I am going to test this matter
thoroughly, '' said the Uoronor. "and see
whether the law will not uphold me in my
contention that I am entitled to all of the
effects of those whose cases come properly^
under my notice."
The stomach of the deceased has been
placed in the hands of the chemist of the
Morgue, Dr. Morgan, and the inquest will
be held as soon as his report is rendered.
A jury was swon in at the Morgue last
evening, the following comprising h:
C. A. Smith, Arthur Balkman, Thomas
McCord, J. Rhtler, James Shme, W.
O'Connor, Alex Schmulian, G. W. New
man and A. Nordman-
Oakley's body, which was sent from the
hotel to Gray s undertaking parlors, was
shipped to Pittsburg last evening by the
overland that Jcft at (5 o'clock.
Four Cases of Diphtheria.
Four cases of diphtheria were reported to the
Board of Health yesterday, being located at
201 Clara street, 416 Third street, 220 Missis

Dr. Sanden Talks to Men.
-rj^^ Did you ever study the source of
S&mikW[ C^v the great energy which keeps up
J^^^m!mSii^wi'\ ' yÂ° ur an ma life â that wonderful,
a *j^^^^^^^^}^ unseen force which comes to your
Â£SgÂ£x M^icSfSi^ aiJ when you desire to put forth a
$Br /^^^mÂ£&r i i, "^ special effort in mental or physical
ffl^w, jÃsjmfi\ j/ action? Didn't it ever seem to
%S. I^/^*^ 0 you that there must be something
'^il^l very peculiar about it, how it re-
J&t&l /^^w^ sponds to your will and steels your
Jffiyl >^^NsP|k nerves for the great final effort ?
\/jÂ£ A-^lfWk^ I \ It is the vital or nerve force of
S%mÂ£~ll\^**' V w IF y our s stem - I* is the foundation
J?sr~* " , w /â ' of your physical, mental and sexual
â¢ i ,rnanhdbd âit is the nerve, grit,
energy, vitality which nature bestows upon you, which is known as
your reserve force, and which comes to your aid in all cases when you
wish to call forth all the power of your manhood.
This reserve force should be at your command until you are past
50, at which time nature changes her course and, instead of storing her
power, begins to use up the reserve force, which is supposed to - keep
up your vital energy to a good old age.
â¢ But some men begin to fail at â some at 40 ; some are lost at 35.
Early habits, excesses, dissipation, have used up the force of â  vitality
which should have been stored, and when the time comes that nature
refuses longer to support the body and it is left to its own resources it
fails, exhausted ; then comes dread nervous debility/mental decay,
lack of capacity for business or pleasure. , ; , -.... .-â¢:
Scientific test proves that the nerve or vital s force of the body is
nothing more nor less than Electricity. If we had no Electricity, in our
bodies we could not live. /; Disobedience .of the laws of Nature drains
and wastes the Electric energy from the body, wasting the reserve
force. To regain it we must use Electricity, which is the basis of all
vital power.- r \": : . . ' ; â¢" . â¢ . ',
DR. SANDHN'S ELECTRIC BELT
is used by the foremost doctors in extreme cases of nervous exhaustion,
and is acknowledged by them superior to drugs or any other remedy.
In truth it is a cure for such troubles ; after all medical treatment fails.
It is made especially for the restoration of nerve and vital power of
men. It infuses the even, continuous Electric current into the body for
hours at a time; charging all the vital parts with new life, restoring
manhood completely in two months. Â y
Every day we publish evidence i of the success of Dr. Sanden's
Electric Belt in curing where medicine' has failed. The . day of drugs
has passed In this progressive age you must advance or be ; left j behind \
with the cripples i and stragglers. ; The most "out-of-date" element of
our social system to-day is the habit of swallowing drugs for every
sickness. This habit, however, is giving way to the growing intelli-
gence of the people, partly because they are smarter and understand
better, but mostly because they have found by experience that medi-
cine' does not V cure. Electricity does, and Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt
' shows ; proof, fresh proof, of this every day. r ;
To weak men, weak women, people who want to be permanently
cured, Dr. Sanden's Belt will prove worth its weight in gold. Get the
little book, "Three Classes of Men," and see the proof of what is is
doing. Free by mail, or at the office. Call or address

CHEERING CUBA'S
LOCAL FRIENDS
The League Receives Con
gratulation From New
York City.
Meeting of the Committee Ap
pointed by the Mayor
Called.
Tho Gathering Will Teka Place on
Saturday Evening Next at
California Hall.
The leaders of the movement in this
country to assist the Cubans in tbeir
struggle for liberty and independence are
evidently much pleased with the progress
of the cause on this coast.
The Cuban League of this coast recently
wrote to the New York headquarters of
the Cuban League of America, telling of
the state of affairs here and sending the
articles published in The Call as a report
of progress. Yesterday President Jones
and Secretary Mascherini received a letter
from the secretary congratulating tnem
on the formation of a committee of repre
sentative citizens and on the calling of a
mass- meeting to express the sentiments of
the people.
The letter urged the necessity of im
pressing on President McKinley the senti
ment that exists throughout.this country
in favor of the cause of the patriots. The
letter reads as follows:
The Cuban League )
op the United states of America, >
New York, Feb. 20, 1897. )
Messrs. John 11. Jones, President, and Faust
E. Mascherini, Secretary, ( Ã¼ban Sympathizers,
2006 Mason Street, Koom U, San Francisco, to/.â
Gentlemen: We nave your letter of February
10 inclosing articles from the San FraDcisco
Call and reporting the progress you are mak
ing in the work for Cuban independence. We
congratulate you on this. The tide seems
Kieudily rising and it bids fair to sweep away
all bn'riers and obstacles that have been
placed In the way of patriotic Americans in
their desire and effort to see to it that there is
an end to the Spanisn domination ou the
American continent. Everything must be
done as rapi<Hy as possible to impress upon
President McKinley that the American people,
without regard to sex, party or fatheriand, are
with the Cuban people in this struggle for in
dependence, and that they recognize that the
soldier of to-dRy Hunting on Cuban soil for
freedom is an 1807 member of the same army
that fought for American Independence in
1776. Cordially yours,
F. W. Glen, Secretary,
Chairman Charlea M. Shortridgeof the
committee appointed by Mayor Phelan to
arrange for a mass-meeting has instructed
Secretary Jones to call a meeting of tde
committee for Saturday evening at 8
o'clock, in California Hall, Bush and
Powell streets.
The reports of the sub-committees on
arrangements and speakers will be heard
and details for the mass-meeting which is
to be held at Metropolitan Hall on Satur
day evening, the 13th inst., will be settled.
The ladies who have volunteered to
form a Indies' auxiliary to tbe league will
probably have a large Cuban flag ready to
decorate the platform on the evening of
the mass-meeting.

FORTUNE, THEN DIED
Peculiar Story of a Quarrel
Between Brother and
Sister.
Coincidence Like That Which
D.stinguishes the Quack
enbush Case.
Robert Bright Had Given His All to
His Sister and Then Re
gretted It.
The burial of the remains of Robert
Bright from Masonic Temple Wednesday
afternoon closed another chapter of a
peculiar story from real life.
As long ago as June, 1895, Robert
Bright's Bister, Mrs. Mary Craie, pur
chased a beautiful coffin in anticipation of
this occasion, but between that date and
the date of the funeral such a breach had
grown up between the two that the coffin
was not used. Another and equally hand
some casket was purchased by the Masons,
and over it Mrs. Craig and her family
upon the one side and the other relatives
, and legatees upon the other the contend
ing factions of the family glared apon one
pother.
' \Vhen Mrs. Craig purchased the coffin
she was, by voluntary deeds from him, in
F.Â° sion of Bright' s entire estate, worth
000. As she sat beside the coffin yes
terday sue had a clear title to but $5 in
the- estate, according to the will which
had been already tiled. All the rest had
been wrested from her by a judgment of i
the court.
The case had been bitterly contested be
fore Judge Hebbard and had barely been
finished and the Judgment secured against
the sister.-recoverine to the brother the
estate which he had given her, when he
i.â¢ â¢ Robert Bright was worth about
$20,000 in cash, as well as some valuable
real estate. He was 79 years of ace and,
his wife being long dead and childless, he
had been living for fifteen years past with
his sister. Mrs. Craig, at 1431 Pine street.
Mrs Craig, 77 years of agÂ«, is the widow
of â¢ '"Biily" Crais, who was at one time
famous for hot Scotches dealt out at his
resort at Dupont ana Washington streets.
In June, 1895. Robert Bright was stricken
with partial paralysis, and thinking he
wag about to die he handed over his
b.inicDook, putting cash for nearly $9000 at
the San Francisco Savings Union and
over $3000 in the German Savings Bank
to her name. He also deeded her a valu
able lot on Pacific street, as well as other
property, with the proviso that she was to
fulfill from thesum certain bequests which
he specified. â
It was at that time that Mr 3. Craig pur
chased the beautiful casket. Not only
that but a monument to mark the grave
of his wife as well was designed and |
ordered. At these attentions Mr. Bright
is said to have been much pleased.
But Mr. Bright did not di?. Indeed, his
condition very materially improved, inso
much that there was no telling bow long j
he might live. The lower half of his
body, however, was dead and he could {
not move without assistance. His sister
could not be with him constantly. In fact
his many wants overtaxed .her household j
and her .^aCtence. He himself insisted j
| '> bat he must have a nurse night and day
land against this Mrs. Craig protested, as
Fbaing an inexcusable expense. She also
/declined to further cook his meals, and
he was compelled to get one of his tenants, !
Mrs. Flockhar:, residing over on Broad- |
way and Pacific street, to cook and bring |
tnem to him. Finally, th- nurses being '
discharged by Mrs.- Craig, Mr. Bright had i
i imse:i removed to Mrs. Fjockhart's
house. He demanded of his sister that \
she return the money he had given her, !
but she refused and also refused to pay
for the nurses.
Brfght then engaged Charles L. Patton
as vis attorney to bring suit for the recov
ery of the money. The case was tried be
fere Judge Hebuard, and a few days ago a
judgment was rendered in Bright's favor.
Tnis, as stated, had hardly been accom
plished when Bright died. Indeed, the
findings of the conn have not been en
tered, and the counsel for Mr.-. Craiz. F.
S. Castlehun, will insist upon a technical
right to have the case retried, on the
ground that the plaintiff's death occurred
before the trial was linisiied â tbe same
point that is being raised in the Quack
en bush case.
Bnght's attorney, Patten, says he has
no fear that this will be done, as the tes
tiaiony was all in and the conn had ren
dered judgment. He will merely substi
tute the names of tne special aaministra
tors, which have already been appointed,
and resnbmit the case.
The deceased was buried by Golden Gate
T.odgs of Masons, of which l)e was a mem
ber, the remains being laid in the Masonic
( "mctery.
Bright came here in 1849 and was a
prominent member of tUH Society of
Pioneers. A numi.er of the Pioneers at
Â»ended tbe funeral. There were eight
j. ail-bearers, of whom two werp from
Golden Gate LoJfie, F. and A. M., two
irom the Past in asters' Association, two
from the Odd Fellows and two from the
Pioneers.
The will was filed Wednesday. Follow

The cornerstone of a new Presbyterian
church was laid yesterday afternoon at
I the corner of California avenue and Lizzie
street.
From the immediate neighborhood
were assembled those that will form a
part of the congregation of the edifice,
! which is to be ready lor occupancy by
' summer time. Children fast dismissed
! from a school close by were a conspicuous
feature of the little gathering of persons
standing closely together about the three
clergymen who conducted the simple
ceremonies.
The site of the new church is upon a
hillside overlooking a large part of the
southwestern districts of the City.
The services consisted in an address by
the Rev. Mr. Jenks of the Firsi Presbyte
rian Chuich, a prayer by the Rev. G. D.B.
Stewart of the Franklin-street Presby
terian Church and genera! remarks by the
R?v. R. W. Reynolds, the pastor to whose
energetic efforts are largely due the erec
tion of a permanent building for his con
gregation. There were also two hymns
sung during the exercises.
The stone, a small, plain block of hard,
gray sandstone, was adjusted to its final
position by Jacob Bost, the patriarch of
the congreeation, who has gone almost
thirteen years past the allotted three
score and ten.
In the cornerstone were placed a copy
of The Call, the Chronicle and the hx

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 5, 1897.
JUDGE MORROW
WAS HONORED
Bar Association Unani
mously Favors Him for
Promotion.
United States District Judge
Indorsed for Circuit
Judgeship
Meeting Yesterdny and Resolutions
Drafted to Be Sint to President
McKinley.
The Bar Association of San Francisco
yesterday afternoon drafted resolutions
indorsing United States District Judge
William W. Morrow for the judgeship of
the United States Circuit Court to suc
ceed Judge McKenna, who relinquished
his high judicial position to accept a place
in President McKinley's Cabinet.
Judge Morrow was the unanimous
choice of the meeting, which was held in
the rooms of the Bar Association, at 530
California street, and was largely at
tended. No other name was suggested.
The secretary of t^ie association was in
structed to send a copy of the resolutions
to President McKinler, to each of the
California Senators and Representatives
in Congress, and also to Judge McKenna,
the idea being to impress these, who have
influence in making the appointment,
with the fact that Judge Morrow is deemed
worthy of the place and is urged for the
office by the largest representative legal
association of the circuit he would preside
over. Who Judge Morrow's successor
may be on the United States District
bench should tbis appointment dj made is
a question that will come up later.
'me meeting yesterday was called prin
cipally for the purpose of discussing the
propriety of indorsing some one for the
Circuit Judgeship. No other business win
brought up. None other was contem
plated.
Every one seemed agreeable to Judge
Morrow, but for fear that it might be de
cided not. to indorse any one the associa
tion held an executive session, in order
that no publicity might be given to its de
liberations should they fail of their object
But there were no objections. Those who
spoke were enthusiastic in their preference
for Judge Morrow. The resolutions will
be sent on to Washington to-day.
A WOfiD TO SENATORS.
The Local College of Physicians Object*
to Certain Legislation.
The College of Physicians and Surgeons
of San Francisco has sent the following
communx'.uion to each of the Senators at
Sacramento. It explains itself:
Dear Senator: The io'e object of Senate bill
No. 265 is to admit students of our medical
college and of too homeopathic and eclectic
medical colleges to tho advantages and privil
eges of clinical instruction to the City and
County II spital on an equality with the med
ical department of tlio Mate University and
Cooper Medical College.
Thi* has rendered necessary an amendment
to the code, because at the time the code was
adopted neither of these colleges was in
existence, and the code .specifically mentions
but two, which effectually burs us out until
the legislature, in recognition of our needs,
passes benate Dill No. '2U~>.
An amendment hns, however, been tacked
on to the bill in the Senate that is foreign to
our wishes and in the House failed to receive
the approval of the House committee and seri
ously endangers the bill. The amendment
abolishes the office of Quarantine Officer. This
a<tion not only brings the enti.e .San ITB.n
--cisco House delegution in opposition to the
hill, but the opposition may be potent to in
fluence the Governor to veto it if it passes.
If tbe House refuses to concur in this
amendment the bill dies, unless the Senate
shall recede from its amendment. Our
students are thus deuicd admission to the
City und County Hospital, but the quarantine
office is uoi Abolished.
We, therefore, beg und urge, basing our pe
tinou on justice and equity, that your hon
orable Senate recede from the amendment
when the bill returns from the House. Other
wise the bill falls on aceounc of the amend
ment.
Being near the close of the session there is
barely lime now for its return to the Senate,
but we iook to you to help us by concurring
with the Assembly amendment to save the bill
which lets our students into the hospital.
Very respectfully,
J. K. Lame. President.
Wjnslow Anderson, Dean.

"IT MUST PASS OR
WE'LL SECEDE"
Judge Kerrigan on the Sun
day Racing Amend
ment.
He Says the West Is Enthusi
astic Over the Move
ment.
Ihe Consul for the North California
Division Home Frun the
Eist
Frant H. Kerrigan, chief consul of the
North California Division, League of
American Wheelmen, returned from the
East last night, where he hai been to at
tend the National assembly pf the league.
He was met at the pier by Judge Dunne,
Percy N. Long and other intimate friends,
all prominent in local cycling matters,
and talked frtely of his experiences.
As is generally known, Judge Kerrigan
went East with R. M. Welch as delegates
to the assembly from Northern California,
to secure the passage of an amendment
permitting Sunday track-racing under
the league's sanction in such divisions as
desired it.
The movement had the hearty support
of Illinois, Louisiana and all the Western
States, and was promised all the New
York votes, but at the last moment Chief
Consul Potter of New York deliberately
broke his promise, and with this opposi
tion the measure was defeated.
Mr. Welch returned a week ago and
Judge Kerrigan after waiting ten days to
see if something c >uld not be done has
come back, his waiting having been fruit
less
He was seen on the boat by a Call rep
resentative ana said :
"I don't know whether you know it or
not. but this thing is creating ten times
more agitation in the East than it bus
here, though California is looked upon as
the leader of the movement.
"I read the interview with Welch in
The Call a week ago while I was in
Chicago, and I have thought just as he
has said that we had better wait until the
National circuit, wlrch will begin late in
April, leaves nere before we secede if we do
tnen.
"I was talking with Root of the Referee
in Chicago. He laid; '(ioing to secede?'
I said, 'Yes, I think so.' He said, That's
rij.'ht; you ought to. We'll be right with
yon.' And mind yon, the Referee ma<ie
the hottest kind of a figut for Potter's
election before the assembly.
'â¢Gerlach, the member of the National
racing board in Chicago, is ready for
secession and hates Potter and his Tam
many-like methods as be would poison. .
"There are seven members of the Na
tional racing board, end Chairman Gid
eon commands more respect than any
man in the L. A. W. to-day. Well, sir, on
Judp;e F. H. Kerrigan.
the floor of the assembly he got up and
eaiil the board was unanimously in favor
of Sunday racing under divisional option ;
that every racing man in the country is in
favor of it. Yet it was defeated. That
shows how little the league cares for its
racing interests. It was an outrage to re
fuse professionals admission to member
ship." â 
Asked directly as to his own position in
the matter Judge Kerrigan said:
"Well, 1 feel this way: I am chief con
sul and I cannot be a traitor in office. It's
just thisâ we have tracks to support and
men are making a living out of racing.
Tliey can't do it any more unless we have
Sunday racing. Saturday afternoon meets
don't pay, and holiday* are too infre
quent. VVe have tested this thing
thoroughly.
"1 would say, stay in the league if we
could get this measure passed at the next
session, bin we can't. I said to Gerlacn in
Chicago: 'IÂ» there any chance of our get
tir.g this next year?'
"He said: 'By no means; the same self
ishness, narrow- niir.dedness and foolish
sentiment that prevail now will prevail
than.'
"Then again a lot of people think that
if it was resubmitted wo would win, and
there is a chance of this. I waited us lon-;
as I couid in New York, but didn't see
Potter again. 1 doubt if he or his execu
tive com mi: tee could do anything. Here
is the assembly, which has by a big vote
stamped its disapproval on Sunday rac
ing. How could Potter or the committee
take any favorable action la the face of
this?
"My idea now is to resnbmit it by mail
vote to the delegates. It could be clone
very quickly. That would not obtain if it
was not that we have got Potter and his
crowd dead scared.
"This secession talk, coming as it does
from all parts of the country and from so
many strong divisions, has frightened
them. Potter, of course, wants a success
ful administration, and here it would get
a terrible setback at the very start
"l have been interviewed in a dozen
different cities, but have declined to talk
secession. lam chief consul of this divi
sion and as such dosire to avoid disrup
tion if possible. If we cannot avoid dis
ruption, then I'll resign and we'll secede,
and do it with a will.
"I am going to call a special meeting of
the board of officers of the North Califor
nia Division for Saturday evening, March
6, at the rooms of the Bay City Wheel
men. As it is a special meeting, the ten
days' notice required by the by-laws is not
necessary. WeJch and I will report to the
board, anl then it can take action. That
meeting will be a warm one, too, I'll
promise you.
"1 met members of the New York,
Massachusetts and Rhode Island delega
tions after the assembly. They were
very, very anxious that we should not
take any step looking toward secession.
From what I learned I feel sure if thiÂ«
were iesubmitted we would get New
York's support.
"That story about We'ch and I being
joshed while on the floor is all rot. He
w&s not speaking very loud and some one
yellftd 'louder' at him. Then when he
exceeded his time limit some New York
man yelled 'time.' Welch was well liked,
and com man del a great deal of respect
both for himself and his position. X was

accorded ail the attention I could have
wished. It was dirty politics tnat did us
up. I told them aiterward that when we
did crooked politics in San Francisco,
which was very seldom, we prided our
selves that they were pretty cr joked; but
we couldn't hold a candle to them.
"The most despised man on the floor
was Monashan, chief consul of the South
ern California division. Nobody liked
him and he was hissed time and acain.
He wanted us to sececie, conduct Sunday
racing and take chances of getting back
in the league next year. This was be
fore the vote. I replied that he was un
fair â thai he wanted us to commit a
wrong to establish a right.
"The Eastern delegates could not under
stand why California was divided against
itself, the south not favorine Sunday rac
me. I argued that the environments were
different, so different that a division of
the State had been found necessary.
"I told them about the influx of East
ern people into Southern Ca.ilornia. They
had tried Sunday racing down tliere and
it failed. Any meet would tail with only
twelve riders competing, for that is all
they had. I quoted the Native Sons â
only seven parlors in Southern California,
against twenty-one in San Francisco
alone and 180 in Northern California. I
told them San Francisco was as far from
Los Angeles according to train service as
New York is from Chicago; that to deny
us the reasonable lepislation we asked
would strike a: the very foundation of our
cycling success, and yet they voted
again.it uÂ«."
Judge Kerrigan said he had enjoyed his
trip veiy much. The weather had been
pleasant and not so cold as he had ex
pected. '"We were always on the lookout
for the San Francisco papers and could
usually get them. At the Auditorium in
Chicago I had j:ist tot hold of The Call

BUTLER'S CASE
TO BE APPEALED
It Will Be Taken to the
United States Supreme
Court.
Application for Habeas Corpus
Drawn to Balk Extra
dition.
Says He Is John Newrcai and Was
Unlawfu ly ArresUd on British
Territory.
Murderer Butler is destined to remain
here many moons yet. His case will be
carried to the United States Supreme
Court on a certain appeal of an applica
tion for habeas corpus.
The application has been drawn up
by A. L. Black, counsel for the prisoner
with many aliases. To-day it will be
properly attested, so that it may be ready
for hasty tiling in the United States Cir
cuit Court.
The necessity for haste lies in the fact
that (%legraphlc orders may come to-day
or to-morrow from Washington permit
ting the extradition of the murderer and
the departure to-morrow of tlie Australian
detectives with their prisoner aboard the
steamship Alnmeda, Dofind for Sydney,
New South Wales, the city in wuicti in
the distant future the fiend of the Blue
Mountains must stand trial on a charge of
several murders.
The writ, however, will not be applied
for until an order shall have been receive i
permitting Butler to be transponed to
Australia. Should it come later the ob
jection will be interposed in time to pre
vent his removal by the next steumer,
which sails about two weeks hence from
Victoria, B. C, for Sydney.
Last Saturday all the papers in the case
were mailed to Washington and will
reach thereto-day. On Sunday Mr. Cormao
of the tiriu of Cormac & Donoboe. attor
neys for Great Britain in the Butler case,
left here for Washington, presumably to
see that no slip occurs in the issuance of
the extradition papers.
These are in substance the grounds upon
which a writ of habeas corpus is asked
for: The prisoner is not Frank Butler, or
Frank Harwood, or Lee Waller, or any
of the other aliases under which he is con
fined. He is John Newman, a British
subject, who has committed no crime
â¢gainst the laws of California or the City
and County of San Francisco. He ia here
detained ami deprived of his personal lib
erty by Barry Baldwin, United States
Marshal for the northern district of Call
lornia. He was arrested waile on British
territory â the British flug covering the
Swanhilda and her cargoâ and while on
'h s tray from one part of the British do
main to another. He was not seeking the
United States as an asylum or a refuge,
aid was forcibly and against his will re
moved from the British vessel in which
he came from Australia.
As the days pass by Attorney Black is
wondering if the check tli&t Butler gave
him on an Australian bank is pood for
anything. He sent it to Australia, but
will not hear from it for nearly two
months.

WOUNDED IN THE HIP.
Sam Mirks Struck by a Bullet Through
a Young Man's Careless
>' ' ness.
â  The report of a pistol attracted quite a
crowd to the corner or Powell and Eddy
streets last night about 9 o'clock, and for
some minutes the wildest rumors were
afloat..
It appeared that three young men had
come out of the Louvre and one of them
had been fooling with a revolver. It went;
off accidentally and, the bullet nearly
killed Sam Marks, a young man well
known among the sporting men.
Marks was going up the steps leading to
the billiard-rooms on the first floor of St.
Ann's building at the moment the pistol
was discharged. He felt a stinging sensa
tion in his right hip, but did not for a
minute imagine that he had been bit by a
bullet. The three young men disappeared
as soon as the pistol was discharged. . 'â¢
Marks had a narrow escape.

quiet one, ii talcing but a moment for brokers to
execute orders in hand, after wbich the inactivity
became most pronounced. The tone was. irregu

were a trifle higher than the final ones of yester
day, but an easy feeling soon developed and prices
sagiced. The fact that Northwestern cars were a
little larger thar those of last year attracted some
attention. There were 317 cars against 198 last
Thursday and 310 a year ag<Â». Chicago received
Dine cats and Inspected out 54.885 bushels.
Liverpool opening cables were V4'4%d lower, j
that decline being less than thai which iuok place 1

Price Current reported a nun of crop-damage
reports from Illinois, lnd. ana and Missouri, but j
gave crop conditions elsewhere good. losing I
Liverpool cables gave a recovery, and late quota
tions on Englisu conso.swere Vfe point low. r, the
effect being seen in an advance of about %c In |
wheat prices. Closing Paris and Berlin cables 1
were higher. hxpoit clearances were modÂ»raie

CORNâ The corn market was In an inanimate
and . uninteresting condition, Even the f>-w
scalpers who make a specialty of trading In this
grain seemed to have forsaken it. Commission
houses had a few sign Scant outs de orders, the
filling of which constituted the day's trading.
Receipts were 281 cars. 36 cars over esti

UAT!>- Ibis market attracted no attention, there
be!n; no activi or inclination to transact busi
ness. What alterations in price there were were
not due to any new developments in tnesitua.lou
or to any recent Intelligence, but depended en
tirely on the action of wheat and corn. As those
markets were dull oats were somewhat erratic
J<ecel(tÂ« were 245 cars, the number expected.
There were no' withdrawals from store. Exports
amounted to Iti'.'.lnl bushels. May oats ciosed

A Snake story.
The last snake story comes from South
Africa. It is recorded in the TransvaaJ,
published in Cape Town, as cold fact, that
in Sekukiniland a native ran across a boa
constrictor measuring about forty-seven
feet, wnicn had just swallowed a young
koodoo buck, all except tbe horns. The
horns stuck out on each suie oi
the reptile's mouth. The native rec
ognized tbe horns as those of a buck
he owned, nnd he ran and got sticks
and pinned the senent, which was dor
mant, to the ground. Then he got hold oi
the horns and pulled and twisted. He got
the buck out inch by inch, until half us
body showed, and then it came with a
jerk and the boy fell over on his back.
Before he had time to think twice the
snake, relieved of his load of mutton, was
upon him, and it seized bis head in us
mouth, and in three minutes the native
had taken the place of the buck, only he
was all inside; there was nothing left out
to pull on. even if a rescuer had come
along. Having swallowed the boy the boa
deliberated turned its i.cad around and,
grabbing its tail, swallowed eight feet of
it, thus closing the mouth and throat,
down which the native had disappeared,
and making escape absolutely impossible.
The Transvaal vouches for Ihe truth of the
story.

lists.
The first preliminary will be held at
Btilej Hall next Wednesday evening and
then on the following Wednesday will

inspiration.

Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 4. j
This afternoon the last carload of the
property of the Salvation Army was
moved from the Eighth-street castle.
The old building has been purchased for
$400 by the owner of the land, and its
c ances are about equal of being trans
formed into a cheap dancehouse or a large
Chinese laundry.
The castle on Eighth street, which is
well known on account of its peculiar
architecture and great size, was the first
place opened by the Salvation Army on
the Pacific Coast, and over the door the
sign "Cal. 1" can still be seen after twelve
years of exposure to the weather. When
the army was young, the headquarters for
the Pacific Coast and their trade depart
ment were quartered on the upp r floor,
while the meetings were held downstairs.
With the immense growth of the
army, the place has long since been
discontinued as heudquarters, but was
kept up as a training garrison and
meetine-hou*e. Two years ago the
town grew aÂ»vay from the location of the
barracks and the corps removed to the old
People's Theater on Twelfth street, leav
ing the old castle for a dormitory lor the
cadets.
During the past few days the officers in
training liave beer, moving their belong
ings, and now the historic battle-ground
of the early days of ttie army is entirely
deserted by the peop.e who built it. The
castle wa3 buiit by the donations <'f days'

ber was purchase. l on credit and paid for
in after years, and a local contractor
named San It rson was prominent in su
pervising the building. It was consid

Buch a large structure witn only a ten
years' lease, but ths city grew westward
so tapidJy that it was abandoned as a
meetinc-house before the expiration of
tiie lease, fc'cores of officers ul) ever the

Head.

Shock.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 4. )
Claude Marx died at Lorin to-nuht as
the result of being struck over the head
by a "Cboolmaie yesterday afternoon.
Marx, who is 12 years of age, and Paul
Clyde, another lad, were playing in the
school-yard yesterday. In some manner
or other, which is not yet made clear to
ihe Coroner, Clyde struck Marx over the
head with a stick. Marx did not complain
much at the time, but soon after he went
home he commenced to feel sick. Later
he became delirious and Dr. I. Colin was
called. The doctor treated the boy. but he
gradually became worse and to-night he
ded.
Dr. Conn reported the case to Coroner
Baldwin and an inquest will he held to
morrow. The two boys have always been
friends and the fatal blow struck was,
so it is said by Clyde, to be simply a boy
ish freak, the blow striking with more
force than was anticipated and in a place
not intended.
"I don't know how the blow was struck,"
said Dr. Cohn to-night. "But death was
evidently the result of concussion of the
brain. I am assured that the affair occurred
in a Dlayful way, and that there was no
quarrel between the lads,' 1
The dea.l boy was one of the most
popular lads in the school, and the whole
class expresses its horror at the fatal
result.

JOHN FENTON'S DEATH.
Coroner Hawkins Inves! jgaten and
Finds That 1< Was I>ueto Apoplexy
Coroner Hawkins yesterday investiga
ted the case of John Fenton, whose death
was reported to him as an accident, and
came to the conclusion that the certificate
of the physician who attended Fenton
â was sufficient. Dr. Newman attended
Fen ton and certified that apoplexy caused
his death.
Mrs. M. A. Driscoll, the stepdaughter of
the deceased, stated that when Mr. Fen
ton had been taken with a fainting snell
on Sunday morning he had rollot.' off a
bed despite her efforts to hold him up,
and that the fall was not sufficient to in
jure him in the least.
He had been residing with her for six
weeks previous to his death, in fact since
her mother died, and they were on the
best of terms. After he was taken ill she
says that Fenton offered to hand over to
her the insurance money that was due
from her mother's policy, but she refused
to take it, telling him that he would be
well boon. She denied absolutely that he
had fallen down stairs, and called atten
tion .to the certificate of Dr. Newman.

Chief Crcwley Calls Upon the M m
b;rs of the Pol a Forts to
Help
The citizens' relief committee for the
unemployed is doing all in its power to
further the cause for which it was organ
ized, and several bodies have undertaken
to assist in the project. The great desire,
aside from providing temporary relief for
those in want, is to provi ie employment
for the majority. It is believed that when
the ocean boulevard frcm Golden Gate
Park to the county line is started the ae
sireJ relief will be obtained. Yesterday
the deeds to the land we.re presented by
tho Spring ValJey Water Company and
Adolph Sutro. The former conveys a
strip 2500 feet long and about 100 feet
wide, from Seventh avenue to Lake
Honda; also a strip 800 feet long by 70
feet wide along the edge of the lake on the
south side. The only conditions are that
Mr. Sutro shall deed & strip 100 feet wide
from the Aimshouse property to the
county line and time given for the com
pany to make the necessary alterations in
its pipe lines.
Mr. Sutro's deed contained a clause that
caused a hitch in it being accepted at
once. It siipulatps that no *ewer shall

NOTES OF THE THEATERS
"A Flower Girl of Paris"
Opens at the Colum
bia.
The Alcazar Company Gives an
Amusin? Performacc; cf
"By Proxy."
Fanny Rice and her company gayÂ« "A
Flower Girl of Paris" at the Columbia
Theater last night for the first time in this
City. The work is described as an operatic
costume comedy, and to some extent jus
tifies the description, for the greater part
of tne music consists of "gems" culled
from op ras, ranging from "Dorothy" to
"Rigoietto," and the costumes, of the
"powder, paint and patches'' period, are
for the most part exceedingly handsome.
Miss Rice should modify ncr flower cos
tume in the first act, though, for it makes
her look like a bank whereon the wild
thyme blows.
The plot of "A Flower Girl of Paris,"
although easy to fo-low, has a <:ood many
intricacies which giveopportunit es to the
star for tlie display of her vivacity. Miss
R cc also sings a good deal more than was
the case in "The French Ball."
Most of the members of the supporting
company have concenial roles in ''A
Flower Girl of Paris." Several of the
vocal numbers were encored last night.
The piece will run for the rest of the week
and on Monday Joseph Haworth and
Margaret Craven will appear in " Ruy
Bias," preceded by the curtain-raiser, "A
Man of the World."
The Alcazar company has been strength
ened this week by the addition of Adele
Belparde and Charles Wyngate. "By
Proxy" is going with plenty of spirit.
Miss Belgarde has a congenial part in the
role of the adventuress, Olga Claremont,
and she more than fulfills her promise
made to Percival Medwyn in tne first act,
that she will make things lively for him.
Miss Kit tie iielraour succeeds in being
thoroughly at home as the American
"mommer," George Osbourne gives an
amusing ideaof the erring "popper," who
does not attend divine service quite so*
often as lie gives his family to understand.

success due to its merits and the good
acting of those who taKe part in
it. The villainous deacon still murders
tbe heroine and throws her into the mill
race without incurring any after-effects
in the way of legal tines and imprison
ments, and the heroine still bobs up
serenely in tbe arms ot Si Perkins, none
the worse for her ducking or the stabfrom
the wicked-looking stiletto. W. M. Couley
represents the deacon especially well, aim
he is even better as tbe ricn old invalid
disgusted at the incursion of the Goths,
who come to pay their respects to his
newly lound daughter. All the parts are
well played.
"Shore Acres" seems to be growing
more and more on the San Francisco pub
lic, for the attendance at he Baldwin
goes on increasing instead of diminishing.
The play, witQ its quiet, trmhful realism,
is one that will well bear seeing twice.
"Shore Acres" will run nil next week.
"The Derby Mascot" is one of the most
stirring plays that the Grand has seen for
some time. Most of the leading members
of the company have good roles, and some
of the specialties, particularly the colored
children's songs and dances, are ezcep

Show Among the First
Three.
"Skeets" Martin Landed Four
Out of Five Mounis in
First Piacs.
Marjorie Was the Only Winning
Favoriteâ Pat Murpby Beaten
Out Easily by Potentate.
Upsets were numerous in the racing
game at Ingleside track yesterday, but
about tne most disastrous in its pecuniary
results to the speculating fraternity in
general was the downfall of Pat Dunne's
pood horse Damien, in the mile purse
race, which was down third on the card
for dec sion. Good Times, Scarf Pin,
Greyhurst and Midiight scratched out,
and the stable tben figured it a cinch for
Damien, which was delegated by the con
ditions to carry 110 pounds. Mr. Dunne
and his friends all purchased tickets from
different members of tne ring, upon learn
ing which the crowd followed suit, and
ihe bay colt's price gradually fell from 4
to 5 to 7 to 10.
Of the other four starters Howard 8
commanded the most support. Damien
drew the inside position and went out to
make the running when the field was sent
away. Oki David kept him close com
pany, and before the stretch was reached
showed in front. Straiehtenei lor the
wire, H. Martin moved up with Howard
S, and joining David the pair sand
wiched Uie lavor.ie, compelling Willie
Martin to pull up, although his mount
was evidently short and beaten at the
time. In a hard drive Howard 8
downed the old norse a head in 1:45. The
winner was fairly well supported at lours.
Outside of the deieat of rive lavoriies
the feature of the afternoon's sport was
the splendid saddle work ot "fckeets"
Martin, The clever lightweight had live
mounts and succeeded in getting lour of
them past the judges in advance of their
fields.
The six starters in the opening mile run
were a very cheap lot. Soniro finally
closed an 8 to 5 choice, with Alma next
in demand. There was a stiff p>av 6n In
flammator and in a drive the latter coit
beat the 50 to 1 outsider, Atticus, half a
length, in l:47 l /i. Sepoy and Fiambeautte
made the running to the head of the
stretch.
The talent fell with a dull thud over the
result of the event following â a six-fur
long run. decided under selling condi
tions. Pat Murphy was considered a
"lead pipe." and 1 to 2 was .eagerly ac
cepted. Potentate, with 5 to 1 opposite
his name on the slates, led the favorite
from the start and won easing up in 1:16.
The 100 to 1 shot Una Que Amo was third.
â  The fourth race was declared off, and a
mile selling affair, witn George .Palmer,
Sweet William, Joe Terry, Marjorie, Joan,
Encino and Franco as starters, substi
tuted. In the final betting Marjor.e, at
odds of 2 to 1, closed a slight favorite over
George Palmer. Encino and Sweet Wil
liam alternated in making the pace until
squared away for home, where Marjorie
took the lead and in a hard drive downed
the late comer, GeorgeJ Palmer, halt a
length. Joe Terry, with Thorpe up, was
a bane-up third.
On Wednesday that peculiar performer,
McLtgut, was beaten by some very ordi
nary company in a race, but yesterday
wa- in exquisite fettle, and succeeded in
beating out the 11 to 20 favorite Midlo in
the seven furlong selling run. The latter
led until past the paddock, when Mc-
Light, whicn had been trailing behind,
overhauled and beat him a neck in
1:31^. Two Cheers, at odds of 50 to 1,
ridue.il by Spencer, was a close third. Lu
cille, heavily played at long odd;, failed
to show to advantage.

FOR THE NEW
POSTOFFICE
Seven Commercial Bodies
Meet and Memorialize
Congress.
"THE CALL'S" POSITION
INDORSED.
A Business-Like Demand That
Work Begin on the Federal
Building at Once.
CONGRESSMEN ARE PERSON
ALLY ADDRESSED.
Several Incisive Speeches and b
Strong Pica for Immediate
Federal Action.
At a joint meeting of the principal com
mercial bodies of the City yesterday short,
vigorous and Incisive speeches were made
in favor of hurrying up the important
â¢work of building the San Francisco Post
oflioe.
The tone of the meeting was fully in
harmony with the course advocated by
The Cal:., and at the conclusion of the de
liberations a letter was addressed to trie
California delegation urging them to be
active in lorwarding in every way possi
ble the building of the Federal structure.
Those present represented and have long
been prominently identified with the
Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco,
the Board of Trade of San Francisco, the
Builders' Exchange, the California State
Board of Trade, Oakland Board of Trade,
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation of California and the Merchants'
Association of San Francisco. Hugh Craig
presided, and Captain William L. Merry
acted as secretary.
Speeches to the point were made by
such representative citizens as Hugh
Craig, J. Syrnmes, Moses Greenebaum,
J. A. Filcher and Julian Sonntag. While
little time was consumed by any one
speaker, the ground was thoroughly cov
ered, and the tone of the delioerations
was so business-like, sensible and sincare
that there is little doubt that the moral
effect will be good at Washington.
It )s the opinion of such men as John P.
Irish and others who have studied the
matter carefully, that nothing will be
so conducive to hastening the work
that has so long lagged as unanimity of
sentiment among representative citizens.
Heretofora there have beeD many adverse
influences militating against anything
like baste in the work.
There was absolute hÃrmony and one
ness of purpose at yesterday's meeting,
end the names of those who took part are
well Known in Washington.
A strong but brief memorial to the Sen
ale and House of Representatives was
drawn. The situation was briefly re
viewed, and the needs of San Francisco
were put forth in respectful language. In
every detail the situation was presented
from a thoroughly business point of view,
and the subject will probably receive
prompt attention by the new administra
tion.

president of the Chamber of Commerce o:
San Francisco; Julian Sonntag, president
of the Manufacturers and Producers' As
sociation of California; F. W. Dohrmann,

H. Knowles, Charles Mason, J. W. Kerr,
with many others.
The meeting came to order soon after 2
o'clock, when Hugh Craig briefly stated
iliat those present were called together by
the aÂ«sociated industrial institutions of
San Francisco for the Durpose of consider
in â¢ certain resolutions which would be
offered later. The first business would be
to elect a chairman.

_ '( I X^'f lffl^'^ right under then

Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery,
they admit that there's something wrong
about their arguments and something
wonderful about the " Discovery." It
isn't miraculous." It won't cure every
case ; but it cures a suprisingly large per-
centage of cases , even when the patient
is pretty far gone with a bad cough, and
bleeding from the lungs, and reduced al-
most to a shadow. Consumption is a
blood disease. The lungs want a fresh
supply of pure rich blood and plenty of
it ; that is what the "Golden Medical Dis-
covery ' ' gives them. It is a blood-maker.
It gives the blood-making functions
power to produce a large quantity of the
nourishing red corpuscles which make
healthy life-giving blood. This stops the
wasting; drives out the impurities; heals
the ulceration and begins a rapid build-
ing-up process, of solid, substantial flesh
and vital energy.
It isn't only consumptives who need
the ' ' Discovery." It cures every form of
chronic blood-disease and all scrofulous
and eruptive affections.
Mr. Isaac E. Downs, of Spring Valley, Rock'
land County, N. V., writes: " For three years I
had suffered from that terrible disease, consump-
tion, and heart-disease. Before talcing Doctor
Pierces Golden Medical Discovery I had wasted
away to a skeleton; could not sleep nor rest, and
many times wished to die to be out of my misery.
Step by step, the signs and realities of returning
health slowly but surely developed themselves
while taking the " Discovery." Today I tip the
scales at one-hundred-and-eighty-seven, and am
well and strong. â¢ The 'Golden Medical Discov-
ery ' has also cured my daughter of a very bad
ulcer located on the thigh. After trying almost
everything without success we purchased three
bottles of. your ' Discovery ' which healed it
perfectly." Yours truly,
Meeting of the Postoffice Committee in the Chamber of Commerce.
On the motion of Julian Sonntag, Hugh
Craig was elected to till that position and
Oscar Lewis was appointed secretary.
"You are doubtless familiar, gentle
men," said the chairman, "with the ob
ject of this meeting, and I am sure you
will agree with me that the people of San
Francisco cannot be accused of impatience
when they impress upon the authorities
at Washington the immediate necessity
for some attention being paid to our re
quirements in ttiis matter of a new Fed
eral building. You will find that otner
cities in the State of California with a
much smaller population have public edi
tices which are at once a credit to the Fed
eral Government and to the cities them

what they have already obtainedâ which
was only done by all pulling together
with a long and a strong pull â they are
even insisting that the present Federal
building shall be removed from where it
is and a larger one provided for their in
creased business. It is a fact also that wo
have contributed to the Federal treasury
in the way of customs dues, etc., a large
sum of money, averaging $7,500,000 a year,
and in return for all this appropriations
have been doled out to us in the most,
parsimonious manner, and we have had to
fight with each delegation for every con

"It cannot justly be said that we have

for the convenience of the public with
reference to postal matters, to say nothing
of the other requirements of the country.

MEMORIAL.
To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives in Congress
Assembled:
Your memorialists, the commercial and industrial organizations
of San Francisco, California, respectfully urge upon you the neces-
sity and the wise policy of promptly constructing the new Federal
Postoff ice building, for which valuable property has been pur-
chased in this City several years since. *
We respectfully request that the unexpended balance remaining
from the purchase price, stated approximately at ($240,000) two
hundred and forty thousand dollars, be at ; once applied to this
purpose, and that an additional appropriation of $250,000 be added
thereto with which to continue the work of ; construction.
The absolute necessity of this work is admitted by all. San
Francisco the principal seaport of our Pacific Coast, has a Post-
office which is commented upon as r a disgrace to our Government,
and in which the public, service is at serious disadvantage. Our
citizens object to the policy of purchasing ay; valuable property
for this purpose and permitting it to remain idle for years until
the interest on its cost becomes sufficient to pay a large portion
of the cost of the building intended to be 'placed 1 upon it, mean-
while permitting the public interest to ; v suffer from inadequate
facilities. â¢ '^. i- ;
Presenting these considerations as a ; basis for your prompt'
a c ion and confident of your favorable consideration, we have the
honor, with high respect, to subscribe ourselves, . "

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 5, 1897.
tion to the resolution which will be pre- I
sen ted to-day.
"I shall not take up more of your time,
but ask the secretary to read a communi
cation which has just been handed to
him."
The secretary then read the following
resolution received from the Builders'
Exchange:
San Francisco, Cal., Marcn 1, 1897.
Whereas, The City of San Francisco has
long been in need of a postoflice building
suited to the demands of a City of her class,
we having many years aco outgrown the
capacity of our present antiquated quarters;
and whereas, a large amount of money has
been expended in the purchase of a lot now
lying idle, and the necessary plans prepared ;
and whereas, the cominenC"ment of the work
at this time would be a great benefit to the
State at large, and also give great relief to the
labor market in its present depressed condi
tion; therefore be it
Eesohti, That we, the board of directors of
[ the Builders' Exchange of San Francisco,
! heartily and earnestly join with the various
I mercantile and industrial organizations of
tnis City in urging our representatives in
! Congress to use their best endeavors toward
i the early commencement of the work, ana
I kiso to urge at the special session of Congress
an appropriation of money sufficient to enable
the continuous prosecution ot the work.
Resolved, That these resolutions be spread in
fu;l upon the minuteH of the board and a copy
j be sent to the joint meeting of Industrial and
I commercial bodies to be held at the rooms of
the Chamber of Commerce, on Thursday,
March 4, 1897. By order of the board.
Oscar Lewis, President.
James A. Wilson, Secretary.
Mr. GreeneDaum su^irestcd that the
foregoing should be laid upon the table
until the remaining resolutions had been
i read.
'â¢There is a memorial," said Julian
Sonntag, "which has been indorsed by the
presidents ot six of the commercial and
industrial organizations of this City and
also of the city of Oakland. This me
morial is in the hands of the secretary and
I would move that this memorial as read
be the sense of this meeting."
The memorial in question, which is in
the shape of a communication to the Sen
ate and House of Representatives signed
by the presidents of the six organizations
co-operating to promote the speedy con
struction of the Postoffice, was thereupon
read by the secretary as reproduced here
with.
"What is your pleasure, gentlemen?"
asked the chairman, when the document
had been read.
Mr. Sonntag moved the adoption of the
memorial, which was done unanimously.
Mr. Greenebaum suggested that it would
be well to make the Builders' Exchange
resolution a part of the memorial, but the
secretary, Mr. Lewis, explained that the
former was merely designed for presenta
tion at the present meeting as an expres
sion of opinion, and the chairman pointed
out that that body had already officially
indorsed tne memorial.
Mr. Filcher said: "These reiolutions
are all right in themselves; they are good
and to the point as far as they go, but
they could be strengthened by some sup
plementary action. They stand now sim
ply in the form of a memorial to Con
gress, but the parties we hav.j to 'pull on, 1
as the saying is, are our own representa
tives and the Secretary of the Treasury.
In the iirst instance we should try to se
cure for immediate use the $240,000 which
is available from the appropriation made
some years ago by Congress for the pur
chase of a site, which can be done through
the Treasury Department.
'In crder to insure prompt|action in this
respect we must work on the department
through our representatives. I contend
that this is a matter in which every repre
sentative from California can work in ha:
raony and with enthusiasm. They can be
made to understand the situation and to
realize, as we at home realize, how much
good would result to this State from the
early expenditure of $250,000 in this City.
The circulation of so much money must
necesÂ«anly disseminate its beneficial in
fluence throughout the State. Its first
effects will be felt here, where the money
is expended, but the subsequent pood will
spread like the ripples on the surface of a
pond into which a stone nas been thrown.
It is from this point of view that the State
Board of Trade feels justified in acting
with you, in representing as we do the
whole Stare, and I believe and repeat that
in order to secure prompt action in this
matter the present memorial should be
supplemented by a strong letter to our
represeniaiives, setting forth the neces
sity for immediate action and insisting
that they use iheir influence with the
Treasury Department to insure a speedy
commencement nnu the granting of the
appropriation asked.
"This is only nÂ»y individual opinion, but
I will move that a committee of three be
appointed by the chair to prepare a letter
addressed to our members of Congress in
both nouses to follow these resolutions."
Mr. Greenebaum: "I think that the
presidents of the various associations
represented are the best committee to
formulate a letter of this kind and 1 would
suggest that the mover make this provi
sion a part of his motion."
On this understanding the motion car
ried.
Mr. Filcher also thought it would be a
good idea to instruct the committee to
address a polite note to the Secretary of
the Treasury calling attention to the
necessity for the Postoffice and to the
action of this body. "Let us wake them
up if we can," he added.
Tne committee, however, thought the
memorial and t c letter to the California
delegation would serve the required pur
pose and at a subsequent meeting drafted
the following, which will be signed by the
presidents of the six organizations repre
sented and forwarded to Washington
without delay :
To the Hon. California Eelegalion, Fifty-fifth
CcngrefH, Washington, D. Câ Gkxtlemen: At
a nieetiug of all the commercial and indus
trial organizations of San Francisco and Oak
land, held at tne Chamber of Commerce this
day, a memorial to Congress was adopted
urging the necessity for the prompt construc
tion of the Federal building and I'ostoffice at
this City. We desire to respectfully supple
ment this action by requesting your active aid
in procuring the commencement of this im
jiortant work. The time is especially pro
pitious; building materials are lower than
ever before in this market, and a large num
ber of men are unemployedâ many, in fact,
suffering in consequence. It is good public
policy as well as true economy to commence
the miik. It will be hailed as a beneficial
measure which will popularize the Govern
ment with our working classes. The public
service needs the building, and the criticism
can no longer be made that, enough money has
been lost in interest on the idle property to
pay for al arge iraction of the total cost. The
unanswerable question cau no longer be asked.
Why did the Government buy the property if it
was not to be made use of?
We are certain of your efforts in our bjhalf,
and thus present the matter to you as a basis
upon which you can predicate your request
lor prompt action on the part of the Govern
ment. With assurances of our high respect,
we remain, your obedient servants, etc.

OREGON FLOUR FOR ASIA.
The Russian Government Places
a Large Order on This
Coast.
American Ship Snow & Burgess Sails
for Vladivostcck With a
Large Cargo.
California merchants have lost another
heat in the race of competition, and one
of the largest orders for flour for the
foreign trade that have been sent to
America in a long time has pone to
Oregon.
An aeent of the Russian Government
recently came to this coast to purchase
supplies for the laree body of troops that
the Czar maintains in Eastern Siberia,
and applied first to San Francisco mer
chants. For some reason, presumably
because prices did not suit, he did not
place the order here, but proceeded to
Portland, wi.ere he boug tit a large quantity
of tne material for manufacturing the
staff of lile.
It is understood that the amount pur
chased will require several ships to land it
at its destination. The American ship
Snow & Burgess, which recently brought
a cargo of coal from Newcastle, New
South' Wales. was the first ship chartered
to carry the flour, and she will sail shortly
with 36,000 fifty-pound bags of flonr and a
large quantity of potatoes, also bought in
Oregon.
The Snow & Burgess' destination is
Vladivostock, ths eastern terminus of the
great Trans-Siberian Railway, the con
struction of which is viewed with so much
â¢alarm by Russia's rivals in the Orient.
Vladivostock is a'so Russia's naval
headquarters on the Pacific, and it iÂ» ex
pected that a large market for American
goods will develop there.
It bears the same relation to Russia 1 s
railroaa that Tacomn does to the Northern
Pacific Â«nd Vancouver does to the Cana
dian Pacific, and is expected to become i
within a few years one of the most im-1
portant places on the Pacific Coast oil
