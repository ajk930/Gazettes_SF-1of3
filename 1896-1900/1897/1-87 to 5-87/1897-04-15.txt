TURKEY'S THREAT
LIGHTLY HEEDED
BY THE GREEKS
Despite a Warning From the
Porte, Raiders Cross the
frontier.
MEANS A DECLARATION OF WAR
Prime Minister Delyannis Assures King
George's Parliament That the Hellenic
Army Will Do Its Duty When
the Crisis Comes*
ATHENS, Greece, April 14.â Assim
Bey, the Turkisn Minister here, has pre
sented a note to the Government declar
ing that if any more insurgents cross the
Greek frontier into Turkey the .Porte will
regard such a movement as a declaration
of war.
Advices received here state that Greek
raiders from Thessaly have again crossed
the frontier and entered Turkish territory.
In accordance with a call issued a few
days ago, Parliament met to-day for the
purpose of voting the budget and passing
an urgent bill relating to the present
crisis. Prime Minister Belyannis sub
mitted a credit of 23.000.000 drachmas for
the Minister of War and Marine. Del
yannis said it was the hope of Greece thai
the powers would agree to a peaceful set
tlement of the crisis.
The present position on the frontier, he
added, was not created by Greece,. but by
the strange policy of states whose pre
cipitate armaments had compelled Greece
to assemble an army to confront all
eventualities and defend the interests
and honor of the country. Delyanni
said the Government was doing its .ut
most to perfect the *" hastily collected
army, and honed in a few days to be able
to do its duty.
This intimation of the possibility of a
declaration of war evoked long and
hearty cheering from the members of the
House and tbe large audience in the
galleries.
Rail!, the leader of the opposition, said
that in view of the exciting condition he
deprecated any debate on the budget.
Delyannis agreed with Ralli and an
nounced that he would to-morrow ask for
a three months' vote on account. The I
Chamber then adjourned. I

LONDON, Esq., April âLate dis

population along the route to arms and
threatening to destroy communication be

The Times' Athens correspondent learns
that a German expert tactician, General

Both officer-* are undertaking these mis

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
I nested such a scene of activity and cx
i citement since Xerxes with his mighty
j host passed through Thessaly on his way
I to Athens. Situated at the head of the gulf
of the same name it has direct inland
water communication with Athens by
way of Triken Straits and Tolanta Chan
nel to the Piiseus and is connected by rail
with Larissa, some thirty miles to the
| northwest, andTrikalaand Slagu. Kalabak,
far up the valley of tbe Salem bria or Pen
eus Rivsr toward the Macedonian frontier.
Almost everyd ay for the past seven
weeks, say* L'lllustration, regular troops
and reserves from the Piraeus and inter
vening ports have disem parked at Volo
and taken the route for one of the three
| military centers, Larissa, Trikala or Kala
bak, and thence toward the very numer
ous advanced posts along the frontier,
ready to go either under orders or guer
rilla fashion as soon as the melting snows
make the roads passable across Mace
donia. Throughout Thessaly. attached to
Greece only since 1881, the recollections of
former struggles against their hereditary
enemy are very lively, and every band of
troops and every warlike procession is
saluted with formidable cries of "Hurrah
for, the war!" and "Hurrah for Mace
donia!" The enthusiasm even runs so
high that people have '. been inviting their I
friends to eat their Easter dinner with '<
them in Salonika, reconquered by the
Greeks.' '. ._. 'â¢'.'â ; l\ ' : -"V~--*
A Greek officer., on being asked what
would happen if all this effort on the part
of Greece ended in a recall, replied: "Oh,
well, we will, not return; we will follow
the guerrilla bands into Macedonia."
This little city, situated under the
somber shade of Mount Pelion and the
twenty-four villages that dot its slopes,
formed even in the time of Turkish power
a Kind of republican confederation, and
would not permit the Collector of Cus
toms for the Porte to come among them,
but carried their duties to him at Almyro,
a few miles down on the west side of the
bay.
The Greek troops do not stop here
only pass through on their way to the
front. The general headquarters are at
LÂ«arissa, an ancient city of some 33,090
people, which still bears something of the
ruinous aspect of all cities submitted to
Ottoman domination. (It has increased
nearly one-fourth in population since the
annexation.* Some few' Turks, of whom
there were formerly quite a number in
this vicinity, still remain. They enjoy
perfect tranquility and even have a Dep
uty of their religion in the Chamber.
They distributed several dundred guns to
the Macedonian volunteer.. The city and
the plains near by are full of troops and it
is a strange spectacle to see Greek bat
talions maneuvering near the mosque at
the foot of the slender minarets and in
the plain, whose horizon is bounded by
the snowy masses of Mount Olympus.
From Larissa _to the advanced posts is
about three hours' ride on horseback, by
way of Turnavo the last important town
before reaching the frontier. . There one
can best see the perfect understanding
which exists between ; the regular troops
and the Macedonian bands from over the
border, the latter eager : to press forward
and tbe former holding them back. The
commandant here is Alexandros Alexun
drou, who fought on the French side in
1870 and received well- merited decora
tions. With him are several chiefs very
popular in the country, among them Liz's
Lipiniotes, S. Barborus Velaias and Nico

SAN FRANCISCO.. THURSDAY MORNING. APRIL 15, 1897.
The city of Volo, the base of the Greek army in Thessaly, is situated at the head of the gulf of the same name, which is entered from the Aegean Sea by Trikeri
Channel, north of the island of Negropont, or by the inland route, the gulf of Orea, and Euripo and Talanta channels, and can be reached by the latter route in twenty
four hours from the Pirscus.
Before the beginning of the present trouble it had some 4500 inhabitants, a large increase from the time of the annexation in 1881, and it is still growing rapidly.
On every side houses are being constructed, and everything wears the appearance of vigor and prosperity. ';'*'*.'p V 1
From Volo a line of railroad runs to the westward, one branch reaching Larissa and the other terminating at Kalabak, which is only twenty miles from the point
on the border where the Greeks crossed into Macedonia week. This road connecting with their base of supplies at Volo, from which in twenty-four hours the
Piraens can be reached by water, gives the Greeks a great advantage over their antagonists. '.â¢*- r-

HAVANA, Cuba, April 14.â A big bat
tle has been fought at Malfiompo, Santa

manded by Aleman and a strong Spanish
column of 1500 men. The Spanish were
defeated, retreating in disorder after leav
ing on the field 200 men, killed and
wounded. â 
Brigadier Aleman, obeying direct orders
from General Gomez, surprised tbe Span
ish column in a disadvantageous position.
The battle was fought last Monday and
lasted the whole day. When the Spanish
left the held darkness was falling. '.
The news kept secret here until this
afternoon, and is now given out by the
Spanish authorities, who minimize the
affair. - ;
Details have come to hand of the cross
ing of the Jucaro-Moron trocha by the
Cuban general Quintin Banderas. They
contradict the report of Weyler. that Ban
deras crossed with only 100' men .' Ban
deras was at the head of 2000 men and
fought his way through after destroying
two forts of the military line on the very
day that Weyler proclaimed this line im
pregnable.
Weyler is very much alarmed over Ban
deras' success, and has ordered an investi
gation by General Arolas as to. how the
trocha was forced. , -
Sugar-cane plantations of the province
of Matanzas whose owners refused to

MgKINLEY STAYS WEYLER'S hand.
Serves Unmistakable Notice on Spain
That Prisoners of War Must Not
Be Butchered.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 14.â
tice has been served on tbe Spanish Gov
ernment informally still in unmis
takable terms that tiiis> Government rec
ognizes a state- of civil : wat in. Cuba,
which demands the treatment of prison
ers taken in action by either side different
from that accorded thus far.
The immediate cause of this notice was
the capture of Rivera and the report that
be would be tried by drumhead court
martial and shot. The President imme
diately after the news of the fate in store
for the prisoner was received directed Sec
retary Sherman to . draw up a protest
aga'nst the contemplated action of Wey
ler. Upon second consideration the pro
test took a less formal shape. Instead of
being delivered to the Spanish Minister in
writing De Lome. was sent for by Sher
man and informed as to the views of the
Government. This verbal protest, no less
explicit than that previously drafted, had
its effect, for Rivera is still living.
Those who have seen the draft of the
original note say it expresses friendliness
to Spain, but refuses to consider the in
surgents as traitors or murierers, and in
sists that they are soldiers entitled to
more civilized treatment. It declares that
American citizens who are pursuing law
ful occupations will held entitled to the
protection of the law. In their behalf no

Not a Moment Tco .Soon, for the

"All Aboard."
FRESNO, Cal., April 14.â What would
have been >. a. terrible wreck to the pas
senger train running on the branch of the
Southern Pacific between Fresno and
Porterville was narrowly averted this
morning shortly after 6 o'clock. At a
point about a mile south of Reedley there
was a washout for a distance of aoou:
forty feet, and but for the warning given
by a 12-year-old boy the train which was
coming toward this " city would have
dashed into it. Â»
The washout was caused by a break in
a neighboring canal during the night anil
was such that the engineer would have
been unable to see it. . The embankment
was carried away, but the track remained
suspended across the opening. The dirt
between the ties was so well* packed that
the water did not wash it away.'. When
the train would have approached the
place the engineer would have been un
able to see but a safe track ahead. Very
fast time is made along this stretch, and,
ignorant of the danger, the train would
have run onto the unsupported track.
"Ii would have turned us upside down
and killed or injured every one of us on
the train,", said the engineer when inter
viewed by The Call correspondent to-day.
"The two coaches weie well filled with
passengers and many lives would have
undoubtedly been lost."
The name of the little hero who averted
the disaster is Ray Ingram and he lives
with bis parents on a vineyard near Reed
ley, about half a mile from 'the scene of
the washout. He bad gone to investigate
the break in the canal and -found the
stream rushing through the big opening
in the embankment of the railroad. The
lad knew that the train 1 was due ;in a
short time and at once realized the awful
danger of a wreck. He saw tint he must
act quickly to prevent it. As j Â«st as his
legs could carry him ha ran borne, and
without explanation to bis father and
mother untied a horse in the barn and
mounted it and -. at : breakneck: speed
rode '.to-: Reed ley. He informed the rail
road agent there of * the washout and a
moment later the operator at Dinuba, the
next station;" received a" hastily worded
message to hold the train, which had ar
rived at that place. . Â», , ,-.:., y/, 'â .;/
". Conductor Frank Kessler was just about
,to call "ail aboard", when the ; warning
was received. The escape , was ' a narrow,
one, and the passengers and trainmen felt
very thankful for their good fortune when
they arrived in Fresno this morning. They
expressed their intention of ascertaining
who the boy was who saved their lives .in
order to reward him.
HUNTINGTON'S VICTORY.
Bill Aimed Against .he Southern Pacific
Killed in the ' Kentucky
. Legislature.
FRANKFORT, . Ky., April 14.â
Southern Pacific Railroad has ; a friend in
the Senate of Kentucky, and for the sec
ond ; time it V- has killed a . bill directly
aimed at the life of this great corporation.
Last week i the â¢* House of 'V Represeta t ives
passed a ; bill empowering : the Attorney-
General to bring suit to annul the charter
of any corporation which, doing business
under the 'Â« laws ,or \ Kentucky, ; failed to
'comply or observe the laws; of this State.
The bill was so constructed as to .reach
the V Southern p. Pacific . charter, and, it is
known, was drawn for the especial pur
pose of giving the Attorney-General power
to demand of this and other corporations
that they report an .-'pay. franchise tax to
be assessed by the State 'Board of Valua
tion and Assessment, and was inspired by
the suit i now pending against the South
ern Pacific Company in the Franklin
County Circuit Court here. This com-
pany, being a foreign corporation that has
failed and still fails and refuses to make
reports, and having no property in the
State on whichassessments may be had,
the , State officers even with . a judgment
acainst the company are a disadvantage.
The -bill was reported ,to tbe Senate
several days ago. The Southern Pacific
bad not detected it in the House, hence it
was passed almost without objection' ; -but
when it reached the Senate vit was â¢ caught
by.thejeagle^eye.- of Huntington's attor
neys in the Senate, and Major Thomas H.
Hays, who is a stockholder and one of the'
incorporators, had it referred to
bis committee. It was here lulled to
sleep and he persuaded his friends that
there was already too mucn law against
this corporation. .. Â" \ *"_';. . - " ,-"'

IDLE RUMORS BROUGHT ABOUT
AN INQUIRY.
He . Was Not Popular .With Navy.
Yard Olficers and They Plotted
Against Him.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April I_.-Tha
Call correspondent succeded to-day ia
procuring an abstract of the evidence ad
duced-at the naval inquiry held at Pensa
cola in the case of Commander Dennis W.
Mullan, who was, until relieved, com
mandant of that navy-yard. The inquiry
was held behind closed doors, and naval
officers have been on the tiptoe of curios
ity as to the real nature of the charges
and of the findings of the court of inquiry.
The evidence will supply a rare morsel of
gossip for naval officers, and will serve to
relieve naval stations, especially at Pensa
cola.
This yard is stationed seven miles from
I the sleepy town of Pensacola. It was in
j a flourishing condition before the war, but
! for the last thirty years has been allowed
', to fall into -decay. Naval officers have a
; constant dread of being sent there. "Any
; place but Pensacola," they say. It is not
! surprising therefore that petty jealousies,
j which are not infrequent in other naval
| yards, should prevail at the old Pensacola
.; yard. ........... '.-:..' / } Â ..-.,;.--:
. Captain Mullan was formerly stationed
i on the Pacific Coast and is well known at
i Mare Island. Later he was stationed at
' j Annapolis,. ; where his . wife" now lives.
; i Commander Mullan's brother, Captain
i John Mullan, has been a resident of
Washington for a number of years past,
engaged in the prosecution of California
State claims before Congress.
Commander Whiting was Mnllan's pre
decessor. Friends of Commander Mullan
say that Whiting is an easy-going fellow.
He was induleent. Whenever any of the
subordinate officers or their wives wished
to make an excursion in the steam launch
it was always placed at' their disposal,
and when thef wished; 10 dance the hall
on the reservation was placed at their dis
posal. Boating and dancing seem to be
the chief diversion of -these Pensacola
naval officers. Commander Whiting was,
therefore, a favorite with the officers and
their :amilies.
In the ordinary course of affairs Whit
ing was sent to sea anil was superseded
by Commander Mullan, who proved to bo
democratic arid indiscriminate in his
tastes. .He mingled with the laborers and
the plain people of the yards too freely to
suit the aristocratic notions of the officers.
He would call ; a'â  hodcarrier â  from his lad
der arid' discourse with him affably on the
topics of the day, whereas his predecessor
was something of a martinet, if this term2
may properly be ascribed to a, naval <
officer. - !
Commander Mullan' did not grant the j
use of the steam launch as freely as did
his predecessor, and when they applied to
him for use of the dancing hall he de
clared that he would not risk blowing up
the powder magazine, which was in close
proximity. â  â¢ â¢ . -
So, being deprived of their favorite
pastime of boating and dancing, .the
naval officers and their wives resorted to
snake stories and scandal. Naturally
enough, the unobliging and non-aiisto
cratic Commander Mullan was the firstvic
tim of their gossip. It was reported that, in
the absence of his wife, he was paying
noticeable attention to a very beautiful
young girl who lives in the neighbor
hood.* The navy-yard reservation em
braces a good many acres of land that is
by sufferance occupied by "squatters."
Some of them are employ' d in the yard
and others have been in times past. Tne
lady in question, a* beautiful girl of IS
years, is a daughter of a former employe
of the yard. .Her people are "plain but
respectable." She is said to be of a very
lively disposition, however, and the
friendship between Commander Mullan
nnd herself caused female tongues at the
Pensacola yard to wag furiously.
Soon navy circles the whole country
over were thrown into excitement by an
article appearing in Town Topics of New
York. It was headed : "The Merry Maiden
and the Tar." It was not signed, but had
been, sent anonymously to Town Topics
by some one at Pens-cola. Commander
Mullan's friends charge that it was writ
ten by the wife of one of the naval officers
stationed at the Pensacola yard.
This article was published I , on January
14 last. In brief it made certain scandal
ous allegations which seemed to fit Com
mander. Mullen's case. It related the
story of "the commandant of "a certain
navy-yard situated on the Gulf of Mex
ico,"' whose gay conduct with other women
in the absence of his wife (who no longer
lived with him) had created a lot of talk
in naval circles. It was alleged that while
the commandant was exceedingly chary
about authorizing the use of the navy
yard steam launch to subordinate officers
and their wives he granted its use freely
to this attractive young woman, and that
it was an edifying spectacle to see her at
the wheel and in full command of the
vessel. It was also alleged that she was
the recipient of bouquets -cut from the
navy-yard gardens, and that she visited
the residence of the commander at all
tours unattended.
The attorneys for Commander Mullan,
who appeared for him at the recent in
quiry, believe that this publication was
made with the hope that the Navy De
partment would take some notice of the
matter. The conspirators against Com
mander Mullan then laid the case before
Secretary Herbert through the instru
mentality of W. G. Chipley of Pensacola,
a politician of some note, woo is ambitious
to ba a United States Senator. Acting
upon the representations of Mr. Chipley,
Secretary Herbert detailed Captain Crom
well to visit Pensacola and make % report.
A court of inquiry was later ordered and
the facts here recited were brought out.
In addition it was alleged by a witness,
that one day when he visited Commander
Mullan at his residence he found him
intoxicated and in' the company of two
Pensacola married women. One of them
was the wife of the engineer in charge of
the . water .works improvements at Fort
Baranca*-.
â¢ At the inquiry Captain Mullan produced
several witnesses to prove that these ladies
bad called on a mission of charity, and
that he was not under the influence of
liquor. â¢
The evidence in the Mullan case com
prises 700 type- written pages. It is now
being briefed by the judge advocate-gen
eral of the Navy Department for presenta
tion to the Secretary of the Navy. Messrs.
McCammon and Hayden, attorneys for
Mullan, stated to The Call correspondent
to-night that they had been granted the
privile_e of seeing the. evidence, and to
make notations, in order that they might
prepare a brief presenting their side of the
case, but that they had not been allowed
to see the report of the board of inquiry.
His attorneys cite the case of Com
mander Graham, who was stationed at
Richmond, and who, upon hearing of the
death of Admiral â¢ Porter, indulged in
profanity and expressed the hope that he
had gone to a hotter place than earth.
Commander Graham was also accused of
falsifyine the record in his own case, but
upon conviction on both charges,- he was
sentenced only to suspension for a period
of seven years, during which time he was
to remain at the bottom of the list with
oat chance of promotion. .
, McCain & Hay den do not admit
that their client will be convicted, but say
that if be should be, the penalty, in his
case will not be any more severe than that
in the case of Commander Graham.* ..'
Commander. Mullan is a veteran of the
late war, having been; graduated from the
Naval Academy in 1863. His first service
was In the We t Gulf blockading squad
ron, during which he was engaged in sev
eral attacks on ' Confederate * batteries on
the Texas toast. ;He was 5 with Farragut
at the battle of Mobile Bay, and was pres
ent at the surrender of Fort Morgan. He
commanded the Monocacy on the Asiatic
Station from 1868 to 1871, and participated
in the naval attack ;v on the batteries on
the river in Corea in June of the latter
.year." He was in command '. of the Nipsic
nt Samoa during the troublesome times
with the Germans, in 1888, and gave pro
tection to "Rein, the American," when
that correspondent was threatened with
arrest by the commander of the- German
eloop-of-war , Adler.* â¢' In h the s great s hurri
cane of March 16, 1889, the Nipsic was the
only vessel of the American squadron at
Samoa that â .'â¢ was saved. Since then he
had; served as Lighthouse Inspector pre

of the navy-yard at Pensacola.' -*â¢*â¢:--

reach of the flood. . At 10 o'clock to-night
a storm is prevailing here, and, as it is
said to be general lor many miles, the
levees must be weakening. Three steam
ers have reached this city in the' past
twenty-four hours, bringing over 1000
head of mules, horses and other stock,
and as many people, the greater number
of whom are colored. Many of them are
without food and shelter. At 6p. m. the
river hud reached 51.6 feet on the gauge.
HELENA, Ark-., April 14.â A distress
ing accident occurred ten miles west of
this city to-day, resulting in the drowning
of a family of seven negroes. Sylvester
Sanders, a tenant on Joel Higgins' farm,
where the current had been so swift as to
threaten the destruction of houses, left
with bis wife and five children for high
ground. Unfortunately, they took into
their flatboat a bull which they valued
highly.
When within a mile of the hills the
Pull, which was almost . famished, at
tempted to eat the small limbs of a willow
tree through which the boat was being
pushed. This action tipped the boat and
frightened the occupants, who made
frantic efforts to right it. In his excite
ment the bull kicked the side of the boat
to pieces and the entire family were
drowned. .:
NEW ORLEANS, La., April 14.â The
river is rising steadily. Shortly after noon
it registered 18.9 fe.tâ above all records.
All wharves along the front of the main
portion of the city are submerged and
much freight stored on them is afloat." At
a few points the river has been washing
into the streets. In the lower part of the
city the ground is very low and the sur
face of the river at its present stage is on
a level with the second stories of houses
nestling under the levees.
*p- ; A ' break at . this ; point would do great
damage. At * the*' slaughter-house below
the barracks the river is washing over the
levee.
v At Amesvilie, the scene of the great
crevasse of a few 'years ago, the river is
again washing over : the levee and the
situation is critical. Heroic . efforts are
being made to hold the levee and save
thousands of acres of rich sugar lands.
: Two very weak places have developed in
Luke Borgne district, the worst being at
â Pecan Grove, below, this city. The situa
tion on Bayou Lafourche is still regarded
as de.perate, and along at Chatafalaya it is
little if any better. The depots ot the
Southern Pacific and New Orleans and
Northeastern railroads .are under water.
Along the city front there is now a "margin
of only eighteen inches between the flood
level and the top of the levees, and most
of .this is composed of sand and bogs.

that the district would not give up the
fight. â¢â¢' He and other leading men have
warned the people to prepare for an over

about four feet higher than, yesterday. It
is thought that twenty-four hours more

CHINESE SWARM
AT THE BORDER
Prompt Action at Wash
ington Prevents Their
Entrance.
Expected to Slip In Under the
Tennessee Exposition Alien
Labor Act
Other Mango' ians Bound for San
Francisco and Vancouver Will -:
Not Be Admitted.
* WASHINGTON, D. C.,, April 14.â
Swarms of Chinese who expected to get
into ; the United States under the very
broad authority given by the act for the
admission ot alien contract laborers con
nected with exhibits at the Tennessee ex
position have. been checked by the Treas
ury Department. Yesterday the first con
signment from the Flowery Kingdom
arrived at Portal, a North Dakota cus
toms station on the Canadian line. The
party consists of 179 parsons. \
The department ordered the Collector
of Customs at Pembina, in whose district
Portal is situated, to hold the parly and
wire all information obtainable about it.
When the news of yesterday's arrival was
received to-day Secretary Gage directed
the Collector to detain the Chinese until
further orders. Tnen he asked Colonel
Budd Reeve, Solicitor of the Treasury,
for bis opinion on the right of Chinese to
make entrance under the law concerning
alien laborers needed at the exposition.
Reeve was given all the information in
the possession of the department, includ
ing a statement from the director-general
of the exposition that it had been under
stood that not more .than' forty Chinese
would b- required for the Chinese exhibit.
Colonel Reeve rendered his opinion this
afternoon. \ He holds that the law did not
contemplate the admission of the popula
tion of the Chinese empire, and that
ample authority is contained in it for the
Secretary of the Treasury to use his dis
cretion in determining how many Chi
nese are necessary to successfully main
tain a Chinese exhibit at. Nashville. The
solicitor maintains that the Secretary may
admit as few or as many Chinese as be
. sees fit. y ' ~ ' :â --â¢. - '
. Secretary Gage, backed by the solicitor's
construction of the law, will to-morrow
Instruct the Collector at Pembina to as
certain whether the person ,in charge of
the party has a concession from, the ex
position authorities, and if no such con
cession can be produced -I to 'â  refuse admit
tance to the entire 179 Chinese. The Sec
retaryhas not determined what he will
do about deciding ;on the : number to' be
allowed to enter this country, but it will
be necessary for" all Chinese claiming ad
mission under the act -relating to the ex
| position to produce evidence.' ..'' . \
opinion of the solicitor bas relieved
the minds of the officials charged with i
enforcing the exclusion la w., Information
has been: received to the effect that at
least 20v0 Chinese would claim 1 admission
as artisans, laborers and exhibitors. J'.\ The
broad phraseology the act gave them a
great ; deal of worry, and â  until Reeve gave
his ' views to-day they were in doubt re
garding their legal ability to prevent, the .
influx^ of Mongolians. Large . parties of
Chinese bound for Nashville are expected j
to, arrive shortly at San Francisco and
Vancouver. Instrucions for their deten
tion have been issued, pp <
WOOL AND WOOLEN . GOODS.
Senator Mantle Thinks the Manufacturer
Will Get More Protection Than
the Grower.
.'. WASHINGTON, D. C., April 14.â 1n
the Senate to-day the subject cf duties on
wool and woolen goods came up on the
presentation of I a .". memorial from the
Wool-growers' Association of the United :
States, asking such rates on raw wool as
will advance the interests of farmers.
One of Montana's Senators, . Mantle,
availed himself of the occasion to point
out that the secretary of the Wool Manu
facturers' Association had been employed
as clerk to the Finance Committee, which
is now considering tariff; bill, and he
intimated that .. such "; employment would
likely operate to the advantage of the
manufacturers rather, than the growers.
' "The Senator is mistaken, " said Morrill,
chairman of the; . Finance", Committee.
"That gentleman called here to give some
information on the subject of the wool
manufacturing business.' _Â»>
"As has been done a great many times
before," put in Frye of Maine. . â¢ Â.
; "He called,'.' Morrill said, "as a .gentle
man of very wide information on the sub
ject of wool and woolen clothes."
"There is no doubt," Mantle remarked,
â¢'that he is a direct representative of the
woolen S manufacturers and there â' is no
doubt that there is a decided difference of
opinion between 'the * wool-growers and
â¢wool-manufacturers as to what should be
the rate on wool. The National platform
pledged tbe Republican, party to give am
ple protection to wool-growers. On the
faith of that pledge the wool-growers gave
their votes to the Republican nominee for
the Presidency. At the same time there
is no doubt that a great majority of the
wool-growers are free silver men. That is
true of all Western Republicans. They
now claim that the pledge of the Republi
can convention is not redeemed in the
wool schedule of the Dingley bill."
After further debate the memorial was
referred to the Finance Committee. - '
- The joint resolution introduced yester
day by vest declaring: the orders of the
Secretary of the Treasury as to the retro
active section of tne Dingley * bill to be
without authority of law was taken up,
and, after discussion, referred to the
Finance Committee by a vote of 24 to 23.
All the affirmative votes but one
(Mantle's) were cast by Republicans,' and
the negative votes by. Democrats, who
were joined , by. Butler (.Pop.), Cannon
(Silver),' Chandler (R.), Hatfield (Pop.)
and Pettigrew (Silver).
A communication irom Mayor Strong
New York to the Vice-President ex
tending a cordial invitation to the Senate
to be present at the Grant ceremonies was
presented, but no action was taken.
A joint resolution declaring the exist
ence of war in Lima and recognizing both
sides as belligerents was not taken up on
account of tbe absence of Hale, who in
tends to speak against it; but notice was
given 7by Morgan that he would move to
take it up to-morrow. â ?.
A communication from the President
was la.d before the Senate urging early
action by Congress order that the
Government may be able to accept the in
vitation of the French republic to partici
pate in the universal exposition at Paris
in 1900. It was referred to the committee
on international expositions.
The Indian appropriation . bill, carrying
over ?7,C00,000. was taken up and Gorman
made a speech urging the necessity of
economy, quoting from . McKinley's in
augural. He argued, that the appropria
tions for an increase of the navy, for
coast defenses and rivers and harbors
might be largely cut down without detri
ment to public interests. :
The amendment reported by the com
mittee on appropriations as to the muc .
discussed question of opening the ; Un
compahgre reservation in Utah, including

Fails to Raise His Threatened Rumpus
in the Douse. -
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 14.â Jerry
Simpson's anticipated row in the House
to-day did not occur, neither did his
prophesied abandonment of Leader B-iley
by the Democratic members. Tbe session
was notable only for the appearance of
De Armond ol Missouri as spokesman for
the little" band of Democrats opposed to
Bailey's policy of acquiescence in the Re
publican do-nothing programme.
Simpson, in the face of an unusually
full House, '. refrained from . demanding
official ascertainment of a quorum.
' Upon'Dingley's motion that when the
House adjourn it be until Saturday, a
division was demanded and the motion
agreed toâ l3l to 38.,, It was. at this point
l bat De Armond appeared as a leader, de
manding a vote by ayes and noes; but the
best he could do, with the h.-lp of his
Populist .cohorts, .was ; to muster, thirty
one adherentsâ not enough to order a roll
callâand the struggle ended at 12:09,
when the House adjourned.
NAVAL CIRCLES EXCITED.
Congressman Shattuck Creates a Breeze
at. Annapolis by Appointing a
; Colored Cadet
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 14.â There
is likely to be a big rumpus in naval
circles. Representative Shattuck of Ohio
to-day. appointed .R. C. 'â  Bundy, the suc
cessful colored boy in the competitive ex
amination, for naval cadet at Annapolis.
General Shattuck also sent a copy of the
order to Secretary Long of the navy and
notified.:. him that he had appointed
Bundy. ?â¢
Representative Shattuck anticipates a
strug le with the naval academy over thin
appointment, but says that he intends to
stand by Bundy to the end and will see
that bis rights are respected and that his
treatment is fair and on equality with
other cadets.
As soon as it became known that Bundy
was likely to be appointed protests came
from the Annapolis cadets, some of them
threatening to resign. General Shattuck
said to The Call correspondent to-night:
: -"We shall see whether tne cadets will
resign or ; not. If they make any trouble
for Bundy, or curtail, bis rights or privi
leges in the least, I shall introduce a reso
lution in Congress to ;".* investigate the
matter and the Naval Academy and ascer
tain if there is a law against colored boys
being made cadets. I don't care What the
unwritten law is. If they don't want to
receive : a colored boy they must make a
rule to that effect: and stand by it. I am
not going to desert my appointee. I have
appointed Bundy and I intend to see that
he gets his place, whether the cadets re
sign or not." -'â¢:.-. --â 'â  Â'-'â 
i--i General Shattuck was quite : indignant
at the threat from Annapolis and says he
will fight the battle to the end.

Ex Governor A'tge'.d Found to Have
Been Responsible lor His "^
Appointment. \*Q v;
CHICAGO; 111., "April 14.â C.W. Spald
ing has admitted that *he p* hypothecated
the missing bonds belonging to the State
University. This admission was made to
F. M. McKay, the University's president,
at the office of Oliver,' Spalding's . attor
ney, on Monday evening.
â¢ "We saw Spalding only a few minutes,"
said President ' McKay to-day. 'He' ad
mitted ~, that he hud hypothecated the
bonds, though not all of them. We ex
pect tnat a complete report of his doings
will be presented to Mr. Keith as soon as
the latter qualifies as treasurer."
Spalding i. either in hiding or has fled.
Nobody seems io know his whereabouts.
An * examination *.' of the Globe Savings
Bank's vaults disclosed no paper of any
value. Several thousand dollars in worth
less bonds were about all the assets dis
closed in the search. It is .claimed many
bonds belonging to the university have
been altered. From the face of the bonds
the University's warning that the bonds
were not negotiable has been erased. It
now looks as though Spalding will have a
hard time to keep out of the penitentiary.
Lawyers say he committed a grave crime
if he made the erasure. f. '. : ;' z'f' ; ; I
The statement that ex-Governor Alt
geld was responsible for Spalding's elec
tion as treasurer of the university was re
iterated by President McKay to-day. The
latter also declared 'that', it was upon tie
advice of * Altgeld alone that Spalding's
first bond was accepted in 1893. McKay
said: ' : : -"'"'--'p
* "Spalding was elected treasurer. on the i
Governor's recommendation , in the first
place. It was understood all along that j
Altgeld wanted him for the position and
that was why he was given it."
It is becoming more apparent that the
ex- banker's business irregularities have
been to a considerable extent the result of
domestic irregularities. Spalding's in
fatuation for his former typewriter and
stenographer, Louisa * Ervine. ; has* been
the root of more evil than is generally
conceded. It is known that he lavished
money upon her. The scandal was so no
torious that Mrs. Spalding secured separa
tion papers several years ago.
Inquiry at the office of the State Auditor
to-day developed the fact that not a soli
tary cent of the big appropriation made to
the university two years ago remains to
the credit of the institution in' the State
treasury. With the official approvrl *of
ex-Governor Altgeld, whose signature was
necessary before any of these funds could
be withdrawn, every cent was transferred
long ago to the custody of Spalding.

. The spirit of the insurgent Macedonians
is not great r than that of the Greek
troops. At the advanced posts of . Ligaria
and Melons, forty steps from the Turkish
soldiers, the "evzones" sing and dance or
exercise themselves in burling great
stones, as if pitching quoits, toward them,
in the hope of provoking combat.' They
ore splendid men. who have preserved the
ancient Hellenic costume in its entirety.
They are inured to mountain life. 'Born
in the country which they are gathered to
defend on the sides of the Melonas Moun
tains, they look with longing eyes upon
the fair fields of Macedonia, the -city of
E assona and the roads to Monastir and
Salonika, then join their officers in
dancing the "tsamiko," a slow, heavy
movement, accompanied with a guttural
melody almost sorrowful. .;-.-'.
Before them quartered miserable huts
are the Turkish .-soldiers. l A correspond
ent essayed a -visit to ; the chief of -the
post, who allowed him to approach only
after a long palaver and with difficulty
consented to let . him enter his quarters.
The unfortunate chief wiÂ»s covered with a
ragged tunic and was distinguished from
his men,* who were likewise in tatters and
most of them barefooted, by the fact that
he wore a pair of slippers â .'strong con
trast with the clean, well-clad; and, well
fed fellows * over the way. To give him a
little pleasure at the cost of a small lie
the visitor told him that he would recom
mend him to the Minister of War ,wheto
he arrived at Constantinople. â¢ The poor
devil smiled and said when be left him
that he must be sure to remember his
promise. These faithful servants of the
Sultan have not touched any pay for many
months and yet they will; submit them
selves to be slain with patient resignation.
Some of them less loyal desert, arriving
at Larissa almost every day, and they
manifest great surprise to see an army
where they feed the soldiers. The same
contrast is to be met with ell along the
frontier. The Turks seem without life
and discouraged, while the Greek soldiers
everywhere evince the greatest enthusi
| asm. ':.". ;
At Trikala, as at -Larissa, the town is
filled with Greek soldiers. Trikala since
the annexation has developed nice-, and
turns to its profit a good part of the trade
and industry of Epirus. In (if oen years
the place has grown from 10,000 to 20.0:0
souls, without counting 5000 or 0000 blague
shepherds who live in town only in the
winter. At this time everything else is
forgotten, and all thoughts are turned on
war, the approaching war or the wars of
other time*.
The prefect. of the city is a survivor of
the great Cretan insurrection of 1866-09.
The old man spoke with much force and
feeling of the violence done by Europe to
his people. "We represent right and jus
tice," said he. "They may tie our hands,
but we will fight with our teeth." An
other time, at the end of a generous feast
which he had prepared in spite of its be
ing Lent, a monk of the convent of Hu
gios Stephanos, on me rocks of Meteoru,
spoke in the same vein in raising his glass
to the health of Macedonia. He drank
the wine to the last drop the better to
show that his vows were sincere and that
he would fight at the need, as did a good
number of these "papas" in former insur
rections.
The same feeling is every where all over
the Levant. The Greeks are quitting busi
ness, organizing and arming, flocking to
Athens and then to the - front. \ From
Marvuo, from Alexandria, from the shores
of the Black Sea and from other parts they
send both men and money.

Excitement Over the Japanese

__
A New Commissioner to Washington.
Government Issue of God and
Silver Notes.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, April 7.â There
has been considerable friction, between
the volunteer portion of the National
Guard of Hawaii and the Government for
some months, antedating even Colonel
McLean's resignation. The volunteers
claim that they have not been accorded
that consideration from the Government
in the matter of appointments to vacan
cies in the various departments to which
their services entitle them. They claim,
ana with some show of justice, that
whenever a vacancy occurred it was given
to. a member of the Citizens' Guard,
Mounted Reserve or Sharpshooters, or
ganizations which are not uniformed and
have no regular drill.
The volunteers claim that fifty-two
nights' drill in the year, besides turning
out for reviews, parades and battalion
maneuvers entitle them to first considera
tion. .
A conference between eight of the most
prominent officers and the Minister of
Foreign Affairs was agreed on for last Fri
day, and the officer, called at the ap
pointed time. After cooling their heels in
the anteroom for some fifteen minutes
they were curtly told by one of the clerks
that the Minister would see teem on Mon
day. They left in high dudgeon, know
ing that the Minister had seen them
waiting through the open door, between
the anteroom and his private office. The
Advertiser of the next morning contained
a long story of the snubbing they had re
ceived, and expressions of their opinions
on the matter.
Minister Cooper afterward called on the
officers personally, and said that he had
previously ordered the clerk to notify
them that he wished the interview post
poned until Monday, and supposed that
when they visited the office they were
aware of the fact. They told him in re
turn that they bad not teen notified, and
that even if they were he might have in
quired what they wanted .when they
called. '
However, it was agreed that they should
call matters square and make an official
call at the time agreed on Monday. They
did so, and were received by the President
alone, the interview 'lasting over two
hours. During this time the President
was plainly given to understand chat the
volunteer portion of the. National Guard
would go to pieces if it' did not receive
more consideration from the Government
in the future than it had in the past; that
the officers were generally disgusted at
ibe lack of interest the .men under .their
command took in military affairs, and re
cited the difficulties they bad in getting
the men to attend drill. They suggested
that hereafter the Citizens' Guard should
be limited to men over the' age of 40,
which would leave more material for en
rollment in the military.
During the interview one of the office rs
charged the Government with favoritism,
and even went so far as to assert that some
of the employes in one of the departments
were paying to hold their jobs, giving
names, dates and amount*.
It is understood 'that this has reference
to the Public Works Department.of which
one of the overseers -is accused of levy
ing monthly assessments on some of the
laborers. ;
The President said in reply that it would
appear that the volunteers certainly had
some grievances, but they had hitherto
not reached his ears. He would promise
that everything complained of should be
thoroughly investigated and redressed.
This is one side of the case.
The other side is that the men are sim
ply tired and have lost their interest
from too much drill. It is claimed th\t
the necessity for a military organization
in this country no longer exists, as the
Citizens' Guard can be called on in case
of riots, etc. To offset this Colonel Fisher
Is advocating the erection of a fine armory
building to cost about. $50,000, which is to
be provided with everything to make the
life of a National Guardsman happy and
contented. He is at the head of a com
mittee appointed to raise the money. for
the purpose, the Government donating
the land and possibly a considerable sum
toward the building.
It is said that all of the officers who
j called on the President went with their
resignations in hand, to be used if the in
terview did not terminate satisfactorily.
By the last Australia the customs of
ficials received word of another cargo of
opium destined for these islands, together
[ with information of the place and a sug
gestion of the date when an attempt would
be made to land it. The little Inter
Island Company's steamer Kaena was
chartered, and on Saturday night left port
with a picked crew, under the command
of Captain Macauley, one of the harbor
pilots, and a force of customs guards and
police under Marshal Brown. The party
took provisions for twenty days and â¢ the
vessel was supplied with all the coal she
could carry. Nothing has yet been heard
from the expedition, which is supposed
to be cruising around the island of Maui.
The Kaena was selected on account of tier
light draught,- from which it is supposed
Captain Macauley knows where he is
going.
All excitement over Japanese immi
grants has died ont, but another lot of 500
is expected to arrive any day. There has
been no rioting of any kind among the
Japanese, nor any. suspicion of any, as has
been re nor led!
The Occidental and Oriental' steamship
Coptic arrived this afternoon, after a quick
trip of six days - one hour and twelve min
utes. The departure of the Australia was
postponed one hour to give an oppor
tunity to answer mail received .by the
Comic

sioner of the Hawaiian Government, leaves

VICTORY FOR ARMSTEAD.
Indictment Against the Colorado Million
* aire for Alleged Fraud Is';'
.". Dismissed.
NEW YORK, N.Y., April 14. -The in
dictment against Henry H. Armstead, the
millionaire mine-owner of . Denver, was
dismissed on motion of District Attorney
Oicott to-day. â¢ Armstead was indicted
last fall: on the evidence of - Thomas Tay
lor, a coal-dealer of Pittsburg, who charged
that Armstead : had swindled* him out of
$10,000 in a stock deal. Armstead was ac
cused of securing a $10,000 promissory note
in payment for shares in an irrigation and
hydraulic mining company which, Arm
stead represented, owned rich New Mexico
mining lands.
Armstead was in Denver when indicted.
He fought extradition' bitterly. When he
finally arrived in New Yon* he drove to
the Manhattan Club, where Judge Mc-
Mahon waived formality by accepting a
bond for $10,000 outside of court hours.
In asking for a dismissal of the indict
ment to-day he asked that such action be
considered a complete vindication. Arm
stead said later that the mining company
was in good financial condition, and the
prosecution was an effort to aid in a civil
suit.
"1 have begun a counter-suit for $100,000
damages ; against ; Taylor," he said, "for
malicious prosecution, and papers have
been served in the case."
A VARSITY PITCHER'S FATE.
Ernest Jesse Cory of Willmmitown, Mass.,
Sustains Fatal Injuries in a
Practice Game.
WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass.. April 14.-
An autopsy over the remains of Ernest
Jesse Cory, the Williams varsity pitcher,
who died last night, proves the cause of
his death to have been a hemorrhage of
the spleen sustained in a practice game
Monday. Cory pitched good ball for the
varsity up to the fourth inning, when he
slid into the home plate. He made the
run, but had to be lifted to a bench. He
came to quickly and though in great pain
pitched the balance of the game. His
work lacked speed and precision, how
ever. After the game his condition grew
so much worse that he decided to go to
the college infirmary for treatment. He
appeared to grow no worse there until
this morning, when he became uncon
scious. â¢ Then the attending phys cian
realized that his condition was. critical
and telegraphed for his ptrents' imme
diately, but they did not arrive until their
boy was dead. Cory was born in Buskirks
Bridge, New York, twenty years ago, and
j was the only son of a well-to-do farmer.

Great Dry Goods Sale in AeuJ fork.
NEW YORK, N. V.. April 14.â A sale of
domestic cotton goods, aggregating $2,000,
--000, took place at the auction rooms of
Wilmerding, Morriss and Mitchell to-day.
Nineteen thousand five hundred packages
were disposed of. The sale was one of the
largest that has been held in several years,
attracting representatives of dry goods
firms from all parts of the country. Among
the buyers were firms in Chicago, St.
Louis, St. Paul. and many other Western
cities. When a comparison of prices was
obtained with the regular wholesale prices
it was found j that the prices of the sale
were only from 5 to 8 per cent below the
regular prices. It is believed this sale will
boom the wholesale dry goods business all
over the country.

COURT OF INQUIRY
FOR CAPT. BARKER
Damages to the Oregon
More Serious Than at
First Reported-
Even a Court-Martial Is Said to
Be Among the Proba
bilities.
-"-â 'â .
Flocr; and Platings Wrenched in Four
Compliments of the Battle-
Ship.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 14.â Nearly
all tbe naval officers in these waters are
of the opinion that tho executive officers
on board the Oregon and those in charge
of the Port Orchard naval station will be
fortunate it they escape a court-martial in
consequence of the settling of the battle
ship upon a rock or r?ef in the harbor ap
proach to the Government drydock ou
Sunday afternoon. Certainly a court of
inquiry will be held, and if the disclosures
warrant it a court-martial will result,
dragging in, in all probability, Naval
Constructor- Capps, Captain Barker, who
was in command of the ship; Commandant
Whiting, who has charge of the station,
and several subordinate officers. Then,
also, the original blame attaching to the
drydock contractors and those charged
with the work of providing a safe harbor
entrance to the dock will be placed.
To-day's inquiry and investigation fully â¢
confirm tbe story of mishap as outlined in !
these dispatches yesterday. If anything j
it will be found that the damages are of i
an even more serious nature. Yesterday's j
expectation of Naval Constructor Capps :
that the water would be sufficiently low- |
ered in the dock to-day to disclose tbe ex- j
act nature of* the injury was not realized. i
It was given out this afternoon by Cap- j
tain Barker that owing to the slow work j
of cleaning the vessel as the water was
pumped out an inspection of the damages !
could net be made before Friday after- j
noon. Meanwhile Commander Barker be- j
lieves they are not serious, and in support j
of his opinion be stated to-day that be
would not be afraid to take tbe Oregon to j
sea in her present condition. He made '
this declaration in the face of the fact that !
a subordinate officer, in a letter to a naval
officer sojourning here, stated . that he !
never in bis experience at sea got such* a j
snaking up in consequence of the Ore
gon's rolling propensities as he did while j
tbe ship was en route from, the Golden
Gate to tbe araits. ".-'â ', -&;Â£",
The Call's* correspondent learned to- j
night from a reliable source that an in- I
spection of the interior of the Oregon re
vealed that the floors and plating of four j
compartments were damaged. One is on i
the starboard and three on the port side.
While no leaks were spruug, this damage
is more or less serious, and . the full ex
tent can only be ascertained with the re
moval of the water from the dock. Two
or three frames were bent and the plating
of the forward turret and fireroom dished, j
Barker is criticized for allowing the Ore- I
gon to remain moored so close to the docK j
entrance as the tide lowered, and the crit
ics say be should have had proper sound- :
ings made, notwithstanding the official }
declaration and pronunciamento following j
the completion of. the drydock, to the j
effect that the shallowest place in the en- j
tire harbor at extreme low tide measured |
twenty-six feet, or t*o feet more water
than is drawn by the Oregon. -.*v : -
HER TECHNICAL IXJURJES.
Washington Reports Confirm the Proba
bility of. a Court of. Inquiry.
WASHINGTON,' D. C, April 14.â N0
additional information about the accident
to the Oregon has been received. Con
structor Capps, who was sent to make an
examination, is expected to report to-mor
row. His seeming. delay is probably due
to careful and necessarily .slow. work re
quired in docking the big battle-ship. This
had to be done and the dock, pumped dry
before an examination Of the outer hull
could be made.
Commodore Hichborn is taking comfort
from the report telegraphed: yesterday by
Captain Whiting. The dispatch said:
"Before entering the dock, while moored
in the entraca of the. channel, the ship
grounded slightly, buckling several frames !
and dishing the bottom plating in th.
wake of the forward turret and fireroom.
Compartments in which the floors and
plating are damaged are Bf)2 starboard,
A 92 port, A 95 port and A9B port. The
damage is not sufficiently serious to rup
ture the plating or cause leaks.".
The port compartment mentioned ex
tends over a distance of forty feet. If the
vessel was strained sufficiently to make '
the flooring in these compartments bulge
inward, as : indicated, a court of inquiry
will be ordered. A telegram was received
at the department to-day from the Union
Iron Works, Sail Francisco, offering to re
pair the damage at cost. Thi3 will be de
clined, and a force of men from the Mare
Island Navy-yard will be sent to Port Or
chard. â ''â â ____________

The CjLfligration Started, by a .Coal

to About $12,000.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 14.â A dis
astrous tire started by an explosion of
coal oil wiped out nearly the entire vil
lage of Lorenzo this afternoon. Lorenzo
is practically - a part of the town of
Boulder, being known as Old Town. The
buildings destroyed were abort the first
built in either town, and .include o'.d
landmarks that had become familiar to
everybody who visits Boulder.
The lire started in J. 0. Boyce's resi
dence and soon communicated to other
houses alongside owned by P. G. Smith.'
The residence of O. R. Bascomb, owned
by Charles Peoples of Scotts Valley, was
the next to fall, and then the fire spread
to Lorenzo Hall, the upper portion of
which is occupied by lodgerooms. . The
wind was carrying the flames northward,
though there was not a strong wind blow
ing.
Tbe Lorenzo Hotel was the next to go.
It was occupied by Morrill & Seidlinger
and owned by H. E. Gardner of Santa
Cruz, Hart man's hotel and livery stable
were caught, despite the efforts of tbe
firemen to save them, and seeing that
these buildings were bound to go atten
tion was devoted to saving the rest of the
town.
Supervisor S. H. Rambo's store was
saved by an extraordinary effort, and
Blum's cottage also escaped th. flames.
The total losses will amount to about
$12,000, and insurance has been so far re
ported on the following buildines: Smith's
house, $400; Lqrenzo Hall, $.300; Hart
man's hotel and stable, $1000.
The fire department acted promptly,
but the location of the buildings and the
situation of the fire-plugs worked against
them. Their efforts, however, saved the
spreading of the fire* into the town of
Boulder proper.

Seven National Ranks Must Pay City
and County Taxes.
SEATTLE, WASH., April 14.â 1n 1891
and 1892, seven of Seattle's National
Banks resiste I payment of city and
county taxes on the ground of an unjust
and exorbitant assessment. Through the
weary length of the city, county and
State courts the case dragged its way, the
decisions in each instance being recorded
in favor of the banks. Now, however.
the Supreme Court of the United States,
to which tribunal an appeal was. taken,
reversed judgment, and the institutions
defendant must forthwith p-v the full
levy â a grand total of about $65,000.
The money comes at a very opportune
time, especially as regards the municipal
ity, whose exchequer has grown painfully
low of late. The banks fought the assess
ment mainly on the ground that com
peting capital, such as mortgages and
loans given to private , individuals and
companies, was not taxed at all; that
bank shares were taxed for their full
value, whereas other property was taxed
on only about 60 per cent..

Ihe Stranded i Vessel's Hull and Ma
\*Cx- '<â â¢'; i chinery '.May Re Saved.
TACOMA, Wash., April 14. The
steamer Edith returned- to-day from its
trip north, on which it "conveyed the
stranded passengers of the steamer Wil
lapa from Bella Coola to Dyea,' their des
tination. â  Captain-, Roberts is in consulta
tion with the officers of the Alaska Steam
ship Company io determine whether an
other steamer shall be chartered and the
opposition to the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company continued." The steamer, if one
is chartered, will be larger than the Wll
lapa; possibly it will be the Sehome, now
tied up here.
Its returned officers say the bull of the
Willapa was in comparatively good condi
tion when they left, and they believe it
will be comparatively easy to save the
machinery with modern wrecking ap
pliances. The vessel was not yet broken
and the engines. and boilers were .till in
position. "_

DAYS ARE OVER
Asylum Doors Close Upon
an Aged Mexican
War Veteran-
Fought Against Maximilian and
Acquired Vast Wealth in
the Republic.
His Estate Afterward Despoiled by
Raiders, Leaving Him Penni
less in Old Age.
' LOS ANGELES, Cal , April 14.â A la
mentable spectacle was presented in De
partment 6 of the Superior Court here this
forenoon, when a grizzled, shaking and
bowed Mexican war veteran, old James
Morel, was brought before the court and a
lunacy commission appointed for an ex
amination as to his sanity.
In addition to being a Mexican war vet
eran Morel played a prominent part in the
Mexican revolution against the Emperor
Maximilian, and contributed to the defeat
of the invaders and the establishment of
the southern republic. He first went to
Mexico as a member of Hays' Texan
Hangers in the Mexican war, and achieved
distinction for his part in that conflict.
Pleased with the country and satisfied
with its possibilities he cast his lot with
the people he had helped to free, and set
tled in the western part of- Mexico. He
gradually acquired land and finally mar
ried an heiress and came into the posses
sion of 35,000 acres close to the west coast
and in the vicinity of San Bias. In addi
tion to this Morel had vast tracts to the
north and south of that place, and his
herds were counted by the score.
The Aztec .Brigade, which played a
prominent part in the history of that
period, was indebted to Morel for aid, and
he says he directed most of the move
ments of that body of men; but as gen
erally occurs in war the raids of both
forces reduced the old man, and gradually
his cattle and belongings were taken from
him. His losses dated from the time these
raids commenced, and at last he found
himself an old man, his family and prop
erty gone and without any means. .' J*J/
Morel came to California about ten
years ago and has been an in
mate of | the Soldiers' Home. Some
tissue ago he was sent to the asylum and
later released.. Recently he returned to
the home and to-day he was brought into
court. He has hallucinations in which be
believes himself to be wealthy. He is vio
lent and profane at timet. He was ordered
committed.
WORK FOR CALIFORNIANS.
â  Should Labor With Friends in the Senate
For a Tariff on Citrus
Fruits.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 14.â
following appeal to the citizens of Cali-
Sornif.mJias been issued from the head
quarters of the State League of Republican
Clubs: - v v ;v%. J, '^l' r; 'l
Deer Sir: Your earnest and immediate at
tention is called to the following:
One of the most important matters affecting
the present and future welfare of California is
the adjustment of the tariff on fruits now be
ing considered by the United States Senate.
The Ways and Means Committee of the Hou-e
of Representatives recommended a duty of 'Â£
of a cent a pound on all citrus fruits, and this
recommendation was accepted by the -louse
when it passed the Dingley hill,- "
In order to successfully compete with for
eign growers and pay the wages demanded by
American workingmen the industry should
have a protection of at least 1 cent a pound.
The representatives of the Citrus Fruit-grow
ers' Association, now at Washington, md the
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and other
organizations are doing all possible to have
the duty plated at this figure, in order that a
California industry that gives labor to Ameri
can citizens, an industry that now remains
paralyzed as the result of the importation of
the pauper-raised product, an industry which
shortly promises an annual income of $15,000,
--000 to tnis State may exist.
Nearly all the countries of Europe, as Swe
den, Russia and Austria, have a tariff on
fruits that is a great deal higher than has ever
been demanded by tne people of tne United
States, and higher than is demanded now, and
these same countries produce no citrus fruits.
he growers and shippers of Mediterranean
fruit are mating this their greatest effort to
crush the largest industry of this State by
means of false arguments, ostensibly promul
gated in behalf of the consumer.
The matter is to be settled shortly and the
battle-ground will be transferred to the United
Hates Senate, and particularly to the Finance
Committee. Senator Perkins is making every
effort to secure the desired protection for this
and other California industries, and it is of
the utmost importance that the Republicans
of this State bring every pressure to bear upon
friends and acquaintances they may have In
the Senate for the 1 cent a pound duty. To
this effect you are urged to write or telegraph
immediately to the Republican member, of the
Finance Committee and Impress upon them
the absolute necessity of a duty of at least 1
. cent a pound on citrus fruits and upon other
California fruits an amount in proportion.
Write to your friends in* the Senate or ad
dress tbs members of the Finance Committee
I vi thou i delay. Ihe latter are as follows: J. _
Morrill ol Vermont (chairman), Edward O.
Wolcott of Colorado, Orville H. Hatt of Con
necticut, N. W. .rich of Rhode Island. Wil-
Ham B. Allison ot lov.-a. Very truly yours,
A. W. Kinney. President.
George Francis, Secretary.

Code Commission.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April Sena
tor R. N. Bulla or this city, to whom the
Governor yesterday tendered a member
ship on the commission for the revision of
California Codes, has declined to accept
the position.
In an interview to-day he said the chief
reason for bis decision was that he did not
fe%l abie to remain practically all the
time in Sacramento, as he would have to
do if be were to accept, for in that case he
would feel obliged to devote himself con
tinuously to the work before the commis
sion. In his opinion (ha duties of such a
position were of the most serious charac
ter, and he could not, without giving him
self up to it entirely, fill tho office as he
would desire to do.
Senator' Bulla was tendered a member
ship in the Code Commission two years
ago, and be regards this renewal offer as a
high compliment.

TACOMA MAN'S INVENTION.
Marine Cyclometer Devised to Measure
the Speed of Ocean
Craft.
TACOMA, Wash.. April 14.â The *, old.
clumsy and unsatisfactory method of
heaving the log in order to calculate the
rate of speed of a vessel and the distance
it has traveled bids fair to be a thing of
the past. First Officer Smith of the
Northern Pacific steamship Tacoma, now
ready to sail for the Orient, has received
word from the Patent Office that he has
been granted a patent on an invention
which he calls his "marine cyclometer."
It consists of a small wheel inserted in
the keel of a vessel, directly underneath
the bridge. As the vessel moves through
the water this miniature wneel revolves
according to the rate of speed, and its
revolutions are communicated to the
cyclometer situated on the bridge by
means of a small shaft inside of a tube
running through the vessel. As each
mile is made the cyclometer rings a bell
and records the distance in the same man
ner that the same sort of a contrivance on
a bicycle records the distance traveled.
Mr. Smith is confident that his inven
tion is feasible and that it will revolution
ize the present method of calculating dis
tance. The only difficulty concerning its
immediate adoption arises from the fact
that it can be applied to vessels already
built only at considerable trouble and ex
pense, but on vessels to be built it can be
placed in position without any troubie
and at hardly any expense.
Golden Gate's Trial at Seattle.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 14.âLieuten
ant Butt, commander of the San Fran
cisco harbor revenue cutter Hartley, is
here for the purpose of testing the ma
chinery and speed of the harbor revenue
boat Golden Gate, recently launched from
Moran's shipyard. To-day the dock trial
(running the engines twelve hours under
full speed with the boat tied to a wharf)
was made. It proved most successful,
and some time next week the Golden
Gate will be speeded. If her machinery,
after being taken apart and again exam
ined, is found in good working order.
Lieutenant Butt will then proceed with
her to San Francisco, where she takes the
place of the Hartley, having shipped a
crew from this port.
CALIFORNIA GAMECOCKS WIN.
Too Fast and Strong for New York Birds,
and Get Seven Out ot Eleven
Battles at Joliet.
JOLIET, III.? April 14.â California de
feated New York in the cocking main last
night, winning seven out of eleven bat
tles. The California birds were owned by
Anthony Green of Los Angeles. Denny
Mahouey of Rochester represented New
York.
Each party showed twenty-one birds,
of which thirteen fell in only eleven bat
tles fought, however, as Green won the
main or eleventh fight. According to
agreement before beginning the fight the
stakes were to be $2000 on the main and
GOOD CHEER FOR THE LINCOLN MONUMENT LEAGUE.
I hope that you will be successful in any efforts you may make
to increase the feeling of patriotism among your pupils and patrons.
W. T. HARRIS,

$100 on each battle, the winner to take the
gate receipts.
A number of well-known patrons of the
sport were present from the East and the
Pacific Coast. Green fought nothing but
cross-breed Japanese. The superior
qualify of these birds over good natives
has never been admitted, and the follow
ers of the New YorK chickens backed
their opinion, freely. New York was
made favorite in the main at $100 to $80.
The four battles, captured by New York
were all won on enduranc-. Id this re
spect the natives clearly outclassed the
California birds, but the California Japs
were so fast and strong that the fights
usually ended before they came to a test
of endurance. *

Keep up the fund for the Balboa road.
Let us show that we can carry through a
local enterprise without a hitch, a haggle
or a bait.
It is Omaha, Nebr., to-day, but it may
be Omaha, lowa, to-morrow. The state
of life along the banks of the Missouri is
very changeable.
The story that the Mississippi was sub
siding was altogether premature. The
.Missouri has begun to contribute to the
floods and the rampage is worse than
ever.
The Oakland people who are complain
ing of the croaking of frogs must be over

There are other croakers that are worse

It is, of course, gratifying to be informed
once more by dispatches from Washing
ton that the tariff bill will pass the Senate,
but what the people yearn to know is the
whenness of the passing.
It seems unfair that Europe should co
erce Greece to keep the peace with Tur
key, but suppose Europe should stand
aside and it should turn out that the
Greeks are unable to whip the Turks, then
what?
The Randsburg couple who made on
Monday the first marriage in the new

faction of accomplishing something like* a
golden wedding without waiting fifty
years for it.
Since the recent victories of the Cubans
the Spaniards do not hold entire posses
sion of a single province in the island.
The Cubans, in fac , are already free in
everything except name and the peaceable
possession of their country.
. The appointment of a commission to
arrange for an international conference on
the silver question will please everybody
except the extreme gold-standari men,
and fortunately there are not enough of
them to disturb the harmony of the
country.
The Palo Alto News remarks "that the
winners of the baseball game at Stanford
the ot er day are entitled to an epicurean
diet, in which the oyster is to play a prom
inent part. Is this because they succeeded
in "crossing the oyster" more times than
their rivals did?
Americans in London will contribute
largely to the hospital fund to be raised
as a memorial to the Queen's grand jubi
lee. They will not only have front seats
at the show, but be a part of tbe show
itself. That is American style, and while
it comes high we tun-t have it.
The Sumraerland Advance is relating

By reason of the generous gifts of Thomas

and California owes him a grateful vote of
thanks.
It is reportsd from Astoria that the Chi
nese have demanded that all white labor
be exclude- from the canneries along tne
Columbia River, and the demand is not

the white man or tbe Chinese; must go,
nnd this is as pood a lime as any to decide
which shall travel.
An order from the Postoffice Department
at Washington has shortened the mail
route from Marysviile to Quincy, so as to
have it be^'in at Honcut and leave Marys
viile back along the road a few miles. To
put it mildly, the Marysvilte papers are
not enamored of this pretty notion, and a
good deal of vociferous Appealing from the
decision is being done.
Senator Morgan says: "That Cuba will
be free is written in the stars that glow in
the unfailing light of the Southern Cross,
to whicn her children turn their eyes with
hope that grows brighter as the night of
their sorrow grows darker. - The senti
ment of that is good and the rhetoric is
line, but unfortunately Cuba is is . the
northern hemisphere and * her children
cannot see the Southern Cross.
There seems to be a . boom in the olive
industry, as the Foraona nurseries alone
are said to have sold over 400,000 trees for
orchards, not only in California, but 'â  in
Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. If the
Government will r now assure 'the olive
growers against cheap European olives
and cheaper cottonseed: adulterations we
shall soon have a new industry to add
millions to our Western revenues.
The failure of the French opera to be
self-supporting in this City for the season
may have been due to some extent to the
lack of a proper opera-house with suitable'
number of coxes. 'It will J - be worth while
to repeat tbe experiment next year, aha it
might also be worth '"-. while to build an
opera-house for future experiments. In
the meantime it is to be remembered; that
opera never pays expenses anywhere. It
is - one of the luxuries that "metropolitan
society must have because it - comes high/
TARIFF REVISION.
According to all reports from Washing
ton, there is little prospect for speedy
action on the tariff bill in the Senate. It
seems that the, measure as it came from
the House will be materially altered in
committee before it is reported to the Sen
ate, and there is likely to be considerable
difficulty in arranging tbe rates of duties
so as to secure a safe majority for it when
the vote is taken.
Demands for a change in the bill as it
came from the House are made by oppos
ing forces. On one side there is a desire
to reduce the rates levied on raw mate
rials, and on the other a desire to increase
them. The East insists that there shall
be no duty on imported hides, while a
number of Western Senators representing
States where the cattle industry is large
ask for a duty on hides' sufficient to mate
rially increase tne price which the Ameri
can cattle-raiser will obtain for the product.
There is also a strong demand in the
East for a reduction of duties on citrus
fruits, raisins and other products of the
kind. This desire will of course be op
posed by men from the States which grow
such fruits. The situation, therefore, is
full of uncertainty, and it behooves the
people of California to be watchful of tne
bill in order that, their interests may ba
thoroughly protected.
The evenly divided condition of parties
in the Senate adds to the uncertainty of
the comoromise which will have to be ar
ranged in order to Dring about the passage
of the bill. The majority for it is not ex
pect-d to exceed two or three. This will
enable a few men to hold the balance of
power when a vote is taken, and it would
seem that those who are least regardful of
the importance of prompt action and most
resolute to have their own way will be in
a position to almost dictate the rates of
duties on the articles iv which they are
interested.
The outlook in fact differs very little
from that which confronted the Wilson
bill when it was sent to the Senate by the
Democratic majority in the House.
Fortunately for the country, the Repub
lican leaders are men of a different charac
ter from those who had charge of the
Democratic measure. They have been
accustomed to the administration of
business, while the Democrats bad been
all their lives in opposition. The Repub
licans, therefore, may be expected to act
together with harmony and vigor instead
of wrangling and disputing with one
another as the Democrats did when con
fronted with similar difficulties.
It is upon the wisdom of the Republican
leaders and upon tbe tact of the adminis
tration tno people must rely at this
juncture, and fortunately that reliance
can be made with confidence. The D.ngley
bill as it came from the House is fairly
satisfactory to the country, and if com
mercial and industrial bodies representing
the people and the interests of the various
sections of the Union vigorously urge its
adoption by the Senate, substantially in
the form in which it was adopted by the.
House, the Senators may be induced to
abandon any attempt to materially alter
it, and by enacting it at once, put an end
to the uncertainty which now prevails
and prepare the way for a speedy resump
tion of commerce and industry.
FOOLISH ECONOMY.
' The accident to the Oregon in Paget
-Sound has called attention to the fact that
the United States possesses in those waters
no arydock sufficiently large to receive the
ship in case it should be found necessary
to overhaul her- for the purpose of *.mak
ing repairs on the hull. In every case of
serious damage to an American warship
in the sound it would be necessary for our
Government to apply to the British au
thorities for permission to take her to the
drydock at Esquimau in order to mil her
in proper shape forgoing to sea again.
It will be seen from this that the United
States Government has practiced a foolish
economy in equipping the naval station
of Puget Sound. It is useless to build
great ships for defense in case of war un
less we build also proper and sufficient
plants for repairing them. It would have
been a pretty piece of business if the Ore
gon had proceeded north in a war with
England and, then, after touching a rock
wnich our surveyors had not located in
the sound, had been compelled to send a
flag of truce to the British commander
and ask permission to take the ship into
the drydock at Esquimau so that we could
repair her and make her fit to continue
the battle with the British ships on equal
terms.
| Warships are not built for use in times
of peace. They are not designed prima
rily for summer cruises of pleasure and to.
take part in water carnivals at San Diego
or at Prget Sound. They are designed for
use in war, and the Government, therefore,
should provide at its naval stations suffi
cient drydocks and all other equipments
necessary to repair them promptly during
a time of war.
The experience we have had with the
big ships of our new navy, both on the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts, makes it evi
dent that we need now a large extension
of our navy-yards. Tne present equip
ments are altogether inadequate to tbe
needs of the navy, and while we are build
ing new ships we had better begin also to
construct proper plants for repairing
them when necessary.
THE EISING MISSOURI.
Tne dispatches of the beginning of the
week announcing that the Mississippi
floods had begun to subside were alto
gether premature. Scarcely had they
been published when new dispatches an
nounced the rapid rise of the waters of
the Missouri and the appearance of floods
along that; stream almost as disastrous as
those which had swept the districts along
the banks of the Mississippi. The Mis
souri floods will of course augment those
of the Lower Mississippi and the damage
in that region, already great, may be
greater still before the waters subside and
the danger is over. â 
At the present time Omaha seems to be
the seat of the chief menace to property.
Years ago the Missouri shifted, Its chan
nel from tbe bluffs of Omaha to the lowa
shore, making Council H.uffsa river town
and leaving the original Omaha a mile ''
away from the banks of the river. The
enemy of the people of Omaha converted
the mud and sand flats between them
selves and the river into an annex to the
city and 'proceeded to build it over with
railroads, streets, shops, factories, stores
and dwelling-bouses.
This year tbe Missouri shows a tendency
to resume its old channel and flow once
more close to the highlands of Omaha,
thus washing away a portion of the city
on the flat and transferring the remainder
of it to lowa as an annex to the rival city
of Council Bluffs. The damage to Omaba,
therefore, will be twofold/;, 'In ,"â"â¢ the first
.place she. will lose much of her property,
and in the second place she will see a con
siderable portion of it added to the terri
tory of her [rival, a predicament which
would _be as disagreeable to Omaha as it
would be- to Chicago to have a portion of
her .incorporated \ area, transferred bodily
as an annex to St. Lotus. -â¢' -i
; .The Mississippi problem taken in itself
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 15. .1897.
is sufficient to fret the brains of American
engineers, but when that of ' tbe Missouri
is added it becomes so complex as to al
most lead to its abandonment in despair.
At the present time it has not been found
possible to even devise a plan of effectively
dealing with tile two rivers.; It is known,
however, that any plan which would be
at all efficacious would .be enormously
costly. , The people along the river dis
tricts could hardly afford .to. defray the
expenditures. The entire people of the
Union would have to be. taxed to carry it
out, and possibly we may see the commu
nity known as East- Omaha shifted back
and forth between Nebraska and lowa
half a dozen times before the great work
is accomplished and the Missouri River
made to take one channel and keep it.
CUBAN INDEPENDENCE.
The recent victories of the Cubans bring
the campaign of the winter to a conclu
sion glorious for the patriots and disas
trous in every way to ' Spain. The Span
ish forces have gained nothing and have
lost much. Their only successes have
been the killing of Maceo and the capture
of Rivera, but these seem in no wise to
have weakened the Cubans, who in spite
of the loss of their generals have prose
cuted the war for independence as vigor
ously and as successfully as ever.
It will he remembered that President
Cisneros of the Cuban Republic in a let
ter addressed to President McKinley
stated that Cuba has now virtually estab
lished her independence and rightly de
serves recognition, inasmuch as' the Span
ish Government in the island consists
wholly of a military occupation, and
Spanish authority is nowhere recognized
outside of cities dominated by. Spanish
garrisons and such small districts of
country as are under the control of the
Spanish camps. In proof of this be cited
tho following specific facts:
Every province of Cuba has risen against
the tyrannical power of Spain.
In over 200 cities, towns and villages Spain
has not a soldier, and has .apparently relin
quished all claim to tbat territory. She no
longer has a civil representative in most of
the districts, while there is not one township
in the entire province but what has its prefect
or assist-nl prefect appointed by the Republic
of Cuba. . IÂ£f__-__B___fl
Spain collects to-day but one-eighth the
amount of taxes in Puerto Principe, Santa
Clara and Santiago provinces that she did two
years ago, while the taxes levied and collected
by this Government have In the three prov
inces amounted to more than $330,000.
We have established througnout the length
and breadth of the island a system of malls,
and the frank of the republic attached to a
parcel insures its delivery at any point It Is
true that there are many delects in the system
and many hindrances to Its efficiency, nut the
same might be true in any country at war,
either within itself or with its nelghbprs.
These statements of the Cuban Presi
dent are confirmed by the Cuban corre
spondent of the London Time;, who in a
letter of which a summary was published
in The Call yesterday says that during
the winter campaign the Spanish troops
had achieved no success calculated to
overthrow the rebellion. The Spaniards
do not hold a single province effectively
and are nowhere in undisputed master
ship, except in some coast towns. This
being so the triumph of the patriots is as
sured, and the only question is now how
much longer Spain will continue to main
tain even a military occupation of the
island.

The practice of presenting infant prodigies
to the public leads to abuses where parents
are unfeeling, and a sad case comes from Chi
cago. Little three-and-a-half-year-old Milada
Cerny Is to give two pianoforte recitals this
week and William Sherwood's name has been
used as authority for the statement that the
baby's touch was perfect and that her playing
was that of an artist. Sherwood indignantly,
disclaims any such statement. He says that
he considers the child exceedingly musical,
but that in his opinion she Is being driven in
sane by being forced to practice. A corre
sDondeut says: "If ever there was a case re
quiring immediate interference on the part of
the humane society lor the protection of chil
dren, surely the contemplated outrageous
spectacle of a three-and-a-half-year-old baby
giving two pianoforte recitals Is one. I heard
this little child about four months ago, and I
then told her father that it was nothing less
than shameful to torce her to play the piano.
It was evident that she had been taught, and
not only taught, but worried into practicing.
She was playing a -small Bach air, and of
course struck several wrong notes, which had
the effect of making Mr. Cerny impatient, and
he spoke almost roughly to the child. Tnat
she is gifted musically is undoubted, but what
she accomplishes is the result of tuition and
practice, and I should say, severe practice.
She appeared to have her eyes affected and to
be a very delicate little baby, requiring the
tenderest care. I hear now that she is almost
blind and that she cannot eat or sleep, and
talks incessantly of the piano."
It is now definitely settled that France is to
have its own "Bayreuth" this summer. "Le
Bayreuth Francais" is the name which Wag
nerians love to apply to the old Roman thea
ter of Orange, which has such marvelous
acoustic properties that modern drama and
opera can be given there in the open air be
fore thousands of spectators as successfully as
in any of the big opera-houses. The official
commission charged with organizing national
representations at Orange, has decided that
the fetes shall take place in August
next. As the Roman amphitheater is
considered classic ground it is thought
appropriate to give classic works, and
the programme â  will consist of ."Lei
Erynnies," translated by Leconte de Lisle,
with music by Massenet, and duck's "An
tigone" and "CEdlpe Roi." It is almost set
tled that festivals will be periodically given
at Orange every two years. The commission
has advised that the ancient theater of Orange
be added to the state-endowed institutions of
France. ' If the acoustics of the amphitheater
prove to be all that they are represented
Orange will be a dangerous rival to Bay
reuth. in addition to the fertility and his
toric interest of the country round and about
Avignon there will be a fascination for the
general public in : witnessing grand opera in
the very arena where the ancient Romans saw
gladiatorial combats. >,- â â â -â â â

P. J. Donohoe, the architect who con

the Reno people are determined to out
rival their neighbors, and with that ob
ject in view ttiey have negotiated with
him to construct a grand hotel connecting
with th* arena in which games of all
kinds will he held.
"I have no hesitation in saying that
Reno will be th- Monte Carlo of the Pa
cific Coast," said Mr. Donohoe in a man
ner that signified that he meant every
word he uOered on the subject,
"It is tire intention of the club, which
was recently organized and which will be
incorporated in a few da***-, to pive a
week's entertainment, commencing on
July 1, which will attract lovers of differ
ent varieties of sport from all parts of the
country.
"In July there are thousands of pleas

carnival of sport which tbe Reno people
contemplate giving cannot fail to induce

"Besides the lovers of good sport will
journey from all parts of the coast, as
railroad travel will be low .md the attrac
tion will b. of such a nature as to induce
sporting men to visit me Monte Car lo of
the far West,
"Now I understand that negotiations
will be immediately entered into between
the managers of the most prominent
pugilists of Americ** and the Reno Club
with a view of having the best possible
tractionsâ that is, of course, pugilisti

"Well, in fact, all varieties of sport that
will attract public attention will be intro

and the arena, which win be built within
the ground that is now surrounded by the
old walls of the unfinished' State prison. 5
"You can rest aasur-d that tne Reno
people are determined to be in the swim,

Policeman William Cole-run Rescued
the Child From the Savage Brute
After a Hard Battle
An owner is wanted by Police Sergeant
Houghtaling for a vicious bull terrier,
brought into the Central police station
yesterday morning by Officer William
Coleman. -
If that unknown happens to be discov
ered be will be furnished with one of the
choicest cells in. the jail, and when re
leased be will be allowed to give burial to
the worthless carcass of the pet brute.
The fellow's non-observance of a City
ordinance prohibiting owners from allow
ing dogs to roam at large resulted yester
day in serious and most in fill injuries
being inflicted upon little Miss Valentine
Goody, the eight-year-old daughter of J.
E. Goody of too cloak department in J. J.
O'Brien's dry-goods house.
But for the prompt action of Officer'
Coleman the child would have been torn
to pieces, perhaps killed, in the very pres
ence of filty of her little classmates.
She was within a few feet of the Hum
boldt Primary School, on Golden Guie
avenue, near Hyde street, shortly before
9 o'clock in the morning. The children
were laughing and playing on their way
to school, and the first they knew of the
affair when the dog fastened his teeth
in little Valentine Goody's left thigh and
she shrieked in, agony as the beast shook
her as he might have , shaken a rat. All
the other children drew back in terror and
ran. . ;-':.,..,"_ .â¢-.;.- â¢ ."'â¢â¢'. '
Officer Coleman realized the child's dan
ger, and in a moment he reached the bull-'
dog throwing, his; weight upon (he beast
choking him meanwhile with a strong
two handed grip around tne neck. ."â¢"â¢.i
j<: Tbe dog growled, fought and rolled over, 1
but go the hold it had on the child's
leg. He proved a powerful beast, how
ever.'and fought ! savagely for : freedom,
throwing the officer to the sidewalk and
escaping long enough to jump at another
child,, whose apron he tore in to" shreds. ' :',
â¢Officer Coleman again seized the brute
by the throat and this time choked nun
until bis eyes bulged out and his frothy:
tongue hung between his ugly teeth. '

that had gathered. '"The dog's mad t

latter wound tightly around the
dog's neck as a collar and packed the ani
mal that way to the City Prison.
* -.. Sergeant Houghtaling sent for the pound |
wagon and yesterday afternoon the brute
was lowered into the well whence ca
canines never return a'ive.
Little Valentine's injuries received im
mediate dressing at the hands of the
schoolteachers, and her father, who was
sent for, removed her to her home at 1002
Golden Gate avenue, where the family
physician took charge.
This is the second time the child has
been attacked by a dog. Last year in Los
Angeles she was severely lacerated about
tne face and ear by a savage pup, and yes
terday's experience has almost frightened
her out of her life.
Policeman Coleman, who saved little
Valentine, was bruised and scratched by
the dog, but not to any serious extent. '
BEANSTON WITHDRAWS.
"Will No Longer Contest for the Office
of Secretary of the. Board
of -education.
Ex-Secretary Beanston of the Board of
Education has decided not to continue his
tight to re am the ' position to which
Charles W. Welch was appointed by the
present board, and has turned oyer to his
successor the keys "and other materials that
he retained at the time he was ousted from
the office. He called also on Auditor Brod
erick yesterday and presented his demand
for the balance dÂ»ie him on his salary as
secretary, which he refused at the time of
his retirement to accept, because it might
prejudice his case in any subsequent legal
proceedings.
Mr. Beanston contended nt the time he
was deposed that the board had no right
to remove him because his was a statutory
office and without the jurisdiction of the
School Directors. He retused to surrender
his office and papers, and his successor
iras compelled to go through the form of
forcibly. ousting him. '*â¢.".'
Since that time the ex-secretary has bad
an attorney delving into the intricacies cf
the law to f ascertain whether be had a
standing in court, nnd the conclusion has
finally been reached that he has not.
Hence the abandonment of the struggle to
hold the office. 6

The Russian barkentine Behring is not

igated her from Vladivostock to Yoko
hama at very small expense and managed
to make this port without even engaging a
pilot or a tug. On arriving last Sunday
night he came to an anchor off Meiggs
wharf, and when orders came to discbarge
his small load' of coal and "trade" he
tripped bis anchor, set sail and made his
wharf. The sight of a barkentine making
sail and proceeding up thÂ« bay gave rise
to much comment around Meiggs wharf.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus

Among those .'who think . the ship
Samaria is lost is Captain Peterson of tbe
schooner Sailor Boy. On March 2. he
was in company with the vessel, and on
tbat occasion there was not a stitch of
canvas t" be seen except some furled sails
on the main. | They had been in company
for sev n days, and ..e last he saw of the
Samaria was in latitude 46 deg. north,
longitude 127 deg. west. At 3 p.m. the
ship was forging ahead under her main
topgallant sails, and about, s p. M. her fore
upper and lower topsails were set. The
next day the gale came up again, and the
waves rolled up in all directions.. The
Sailor Boy could not carry any canvas.
The seas broke aboard from the east
southeast, from the south and the west.
Once in awhile the waves would break
aboard from all three directions at once,
and then there was trouble. The Sailor
Boy weathered the storm, but Captain
Peterson is afraid that she has gone. A
request, made by tbe owners of the Sama
ria, has been sent to Collector Wise, and
the chances are that the revenue cutter
Rush will be sent out to hunt. for the
missing vessel.
Governor Budd and Dr. Chalmers and
Morse made an excursion around the bay
yesterday. Tne general opinion was that
tbe party was out for a pleasure trip, but
the Stale officials asserted they were out
on a visit of inspection. After looking the
Governor Perkins over the party went for
a merry trip around the bay.
The ship St. Nicholas had a narrow
escape yesterday from running into
Howard-street wharf. Tbe 'â ' tugs - Sea
Witch and Redmond had her in tow and
in a critical moment the Tatter's line
parted. The Sea Witch went full speed
astern and checked the speed of the St.
Nicholas. Not before she had crashed
into the pier, howeyer. The damage will
not amount to $500.

ALL THE TROUBLE
SETTLED AT LAST
The Miller & Lux Properly
Massed in a Great
Corporation.
It Is Capitalized on the Basis
of Twelve Million
Dollars.
Henry Miller to Control Four-Sevenths
of the Stock and Be tin
President..
â  '-. - â  a'
All the litigation over the great estate
of Miller & Lux, which has attracted:
such attention, has been settled, at last by
the formation of a corporation, in which
the heirs hold stock in proportion to their
interests, or on a basis at least on which
they have agreed.
The value of the estate has been esti
mated roughly in times past all the way
from $2 000,000 to $20,0.0,000. The heirs,
however, agreed that all the property
should be sold to the corporation on the
basis of $1,750,090. The company itself,
however, is capitalized for $12,000,000.
Henry Wilier will according to the ar
rangement control four of the seven direc
tors, thus riving him a majority of one.
Putting it another way to simplify the
matter as regards the various heirs, he
.will control eight-fourteenths of the
stock, the German heirs three-fourteenths
and the other heirs three-fourteenths.
The voluminous legal document setting
forth the various points o the basis for
the settlement says in part :
The parties to the agreement are Henry
Miller of the first part, of the second part,
Henry -Lux, Philip Lux, Barbara Lux
nry Roebing Sr., Henry Roebing Jr.,
Dorothy Pott, Henry. Lux as tbe adminis
trator of the estate of Dorothy Roebing;
Salome Lux Wolf, Caroline Lux, Michel
Emit Lux," George Lux, Henry Lux, as
guardian of the estates of Emit and
George Lux (minors); Henry Lux as ad
ministrator of the estate of George Lux,
deceased, and Jesse 8. Potter as trustee
under the will of Charles Lux, deceased,
for the benefit of Henry Lux and- bis chil
dren, C. H. Lux, Lenox Lux McÃride and
Lizzie M. Pott. '.r;.V^
The parties of the third part are Thomas
li. Bishop and Agro N. Lewis, executors
and trustees of the will of Miranda W.
Lux. Th" party of the fourth part is
Jesse S. Poller, executor of the will of
Charles Lux, and the party of the fifth
part is Jesse S. Potter, as the sole heir at
law of Miranda W. Lux.
The agreement is dated April 8, but was
not signed by all the parties till yester
day. The facts were given at Delmas &

CALIFORNIA RAN
FAST AND GAME LY
Led Caesarian Out for the
Emeryville Handi
cap.
The Books Laid 12 to i Against
the Daughter of Mid- ,
lothian.
Una Colorado Won in a Hard Drive.
Roadwarmer Was Played for a
"Killing" at Long Olds.
California, the fast Midlothian mare,
carrying the cardinal colors of Tully Coul
ter, won the Emeryville handicap decided
at the track on the other side yesterday,
in a hard drive, from Caesarian, and that,
at the very invigorating odds of 12 to 1.
The distance was six and a half furlongs
and California, carrying US pounds, was
given a decided overlook by the wise ones.,
Zamar 11, with 107 up and Willie Martin to
do the piloting, opened a 6 to 5 favorite,
receding to twos around post time. Cae
sarian, assigned top weight, 122 pounds,
made a grand effort and but for a mistake
of Henry Shields would probaoly have
annexed the stake. Striking the stretch
with a commanding lead, Shields, instead
of hugging- the rail, allowed Coady on
California to get up on the inside and, in
the hardest sort of a drive, was beaten out
. bead, to the fast time of 1:21 flat. St.
.Lee, at 30 to 1, was third. Zamar, cut off
on two or three occasions, was never dan-
goon
The card was quite a fetching one and
the beautiful weather attracted a large at
tendance. The sport was good and three
winning favorites helped deplete the book
makers' bank-rolls considerably.
The fifth race of the day, a cheap mile
selling affair, was to have been the occa
sion of a watermelon party, but tbe "good
thing" crawled. The faint-hearted but
speedy Roadwarmer was backed down by
his party Irom 40 to 8 to 1, and after lead
ing bis field to within less than a furlong
from home, was attacked with a feeling of
ennui and staggered in third. Masoero, a
15 to 1 shot, ridden by Jimmy Bozeman,
beat tbe 8 to 5 favorite Manchester out by
two lengths in 1:42.
The Mariner mare MollieÃ came within
nose of landing the opening mile selling
purse at odds of 20 to 1. She raced head
and head most of the way with the 4 to 5
favorite Una Colorado, but when it came
to the final pinch Eddie' Jones outfinisheo
Prawley and gained the decision for the
first choice. Sea Spray was a fair third.
Ricardo, ridden by Ruiz, stumbled and
fell, after going a quarter, the lad escap
ing without injury.
The Roman opened an even money
choice for the nine and a half furlong run,
but such a heavy play went in on Cash
Day|_gainst which 3 to 1 was laid that
tbe odds against The Roman lengthened
to 9to 5. He headed his company in the
stretch, and won with something in re
serve from Grady, a 300 to 1 shot. Cash
Day was third. Willie Martin was late in
malting his run with Satsuma.
Osric 11. the 9 to 10 favorite for the mile
Belling run that followed, landed tbe purse
through Hennessy'. good saddle work.
Nebula, an 8 to 1 chance ridden by Bob
Isom, made the running and was only
nipped out the last jump by the favorite.
Soniro jnished in third position.
Howard S was a piping hot 9 to 10 favor
ite for the mile and a furlong purse that
concluded the afternoon's racing, and was
easily beaten out by Instaliator, the Bru
tus horse covering the distance in 1:54
flat. Enos on the favorite laid away in
last place during the early part of the
running, and when be finally made bis
run could n ver get within a couple of
lengths of the second choice, which was
cleverly ridden by Isom.

SEWERS TOR SUNSET DISTRICT.
Active Preparations Ketarded Because
of Obstacles to Be Overcome.
The Sunset district shows signs of
rivaling its neighbor. Richmond, north of
the park. But before it can get fairly on
the way it has to overcome many ob
stacles. The one gigantic feature which
retards immediate progr... is the lack of
a system of sewerage to drain the entire
valley. So far the Sunset district is with
out a main -ewer outlet to the ocean, and
until ibis is accomplished there can be
no permanent system of improvement
made.
At a meeting of the Improvement Club
on Tuesday night, at Ninth avenue ana H
street, this important question was fully
discussed. A map of the locality was
shown, with a sketch of a contemplated
sewer from Sixieenth avenue to the ocean,
with side sewers starting from Seventh
avenue and X street-
President R. Keller and Secretary J. J.
Walsh reported for the executive com
mittee that tbe Supervisors would order a
grade established on Nineteenth avenue if
the property-owners so desired. The club
favored the extension of the pound limits
to Ninth avenue. A resolution was
adopted petitioning the Park Commis
sioners to construct a road from Second or
Third avenue through to Stanyan street.
Notwithstanding the many drawbacks
several new buildings are under way,
notably on the block bounded by Elev
enth and Twelfth avenues and H and
I streets. i
Charles Lundberg is erecting an East
lake cottage on the south line of X street,
between Ninth and Tenth av-inues.
George Salsbury is building a residence on
the north side of X street, between Ninth
and Tenth avenues. Robert Webb is
erecting a home on the east line of Tenth
avenue, between Land M streets.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 15, 1897.
MADE A FORTUNE
IN TWO HOURS
Arrival of Two Princes
Fortunati From Far
Coolgardie.
Their Mines Are Now Turning
Out Gold at the Rate of
$2500 a Day.
The Man Who Discover*d the Gold
Fields Was a San Fran
ciscan.
Among the notables who arrived on the
Australia yesterday were the Hurst broth
ers. Tbey are famous in the Coolgardie min
ing district in Western Australia as the
men who took out $32,000 â  worth of gold
ore in two hours, and for having made a
fortune in as many hours as their year..
They are both youDg men, and are only
making a tour of the world prior to return
ing to Western Australia, where they
G. P. and C F. HURST, the Young Millionaire Miners, Who Have
Just Arrived From Coolgardie. CF. Hurst Is Shown on
His Favorite Camel Journeying Through the Desert.
have enormous mining interests. G. P.
Hurst is managing director of tae Han
nan's Croesus Gold Mining Company,
Limited; Hannan's North Croesus Gold
Mining Company, Limited; Tindal'a Gold
Mines Development Company, Limited;
Catherwood Gold Mines, Limited ; Hands-
Across-tbe-Sea Gold Mining Company,
Limited; Hamilton's Westralia Syndi
cate, Limited; Hurst's Mines, Limited;
Fairley's Creek Gold Mining Company,
Limited; Australian Copper Trust,
Limited. His brother, C. F. Hurst, is
equally interested with him in all tho
ventures.
G. P. Hurst is a mineralogist and C. F.
Hurst is a mining engineer. In talking
about their experiences yesterday the
elder brother said: "Coolgardie is the
richest gold field on the face of the earth,
not barring the Comstock lode or the
South African mines. The only trouble
is that there is no water. For instance,
we have a fen-stamp battery at our mines
and all we can get is two ounces to the
ton. The '. same ore we ship to Swansea
and our returns are fourteen ounces to the
ton.
"When we first went to Australia and.
found ourselves, on the road to Coolgardie
we were a little downhearted. We had to
take to camels, and they are terrors.
about a ship tossing at sea and then
about the ship of the desert, . there is no
comparison. Mv back aches yet after a
six months' holiday. from my last trip on
the ship of the desert."
"On our arrival at Coolgardie we located
a mine, and alter sinking twenty feet we
struck the ledge. It was rich with gold.
We put in a charge of dynamite, and then
in two hours we took out Â£6500 of oie with
our picks. The mine is now known as
'The Hursts' find.' . and is turning .out
gold at the rate of Â£500 a day."
The young millionaires are now on a
trip around the world. They left Perth,
in Western Australia, and went â¢to Fiji.
After spending a month among the
islands .they went - to Samoa, and â¢ from
Apia went to Honolulu on the . Monowai.
At the latter place they stopped off again
and went to the volcano and also to Molo
kai. 1 ; Their purpose â¢is, to . stay :in San
Francisco a month and then go direct to
New York. Thence â¢ tbey will go to Eng
land, and after an exetended tour of the
Continent will come back to America.

: "The honor of discovering Cool Bardic
is due to an American," said Mr. Hurst,
after a Dante. "Arthur Bayley was a San
Francisco man and, aa he told me many a
time, us-d to live at the New Wisconsin
Hotel. He went to the Coeur d'Alene
district, but at the time of the strike' he
quit and came to San ; Francisco. ' After
remaining idle for a time he and his ; wife
pact-ed up their belongings and went to
Australia. On arriving in Melbourne he
looked around for a' good mining location
and finally decided upon the desert. land
now called â¢ Coolgardie. . In _ a few days he
located what is now known as Bayley's
Reward mine and he and his partner dug
out of it 13,500 ounces of gold inside of a
month. Bayley started a way with an es
cort to bank the money and while he was
gone his partner hna to keep off intruders
at the point of a shotgun. ; From that on
the daily output of the mine was enor
mous and soon Bailey sold out a sixth in
terest for $150,000 cash.
"Just before we started on our trip he
died, and his one-sixth interest was sold
for $165,000. After his -death there was a
meeting of the miners in the principal
pub (saloon), and in ten minutes there
was $20,000 in cold cash on the table to
erect a monument to the memory of the
discoverer of Coolgardie. His. widow was
in Melbourne squaring. up the estate when
we left, and as soon as everything is
straightened out she will return to San
Francisco."
The Hursts have with them a small iron
box full of the richest specimens that have
been seen in California in many a day.
The small portions of rock are held to
gether by golden bands, and the latter are
so numerous that in many instances the
mass looks as though it were pure gold.
"Oh, my back!" was the last remark
made by C. F. Hurst. "I wish I had that
camel here to take the kink out of it."
NO MATCH RELAY RACE.
Bay City and Olympic Wheelmen
Have Adjusted Their
Differences.
The Eest Interests of Cycling Would
Not Be Subserved by tbe
Proposed Race.
The differences botween the Olympic
Club Wheelmen and the Bay City Wheel
men have been amicably adjusted, and
the much-talked-of match relay race be
tween the two clubs will not be held.
Ever since the big race on April 4 be
tween teams from ten of the coast cycling
clubs, there has been talk of a match race
between the Olympics and Bay Citys.
One word led to another among the leaders
of the two clubs, until considerable bittei
ness resulted. It soon became evident to
these leaders that the true sportsmanship
side of the question was being lost sight
of, and that more important 'matters,
vital to the best interests of cycling in the'
State, were suffering and would continue
to suffer so long as this question of a
match race, from which no good could
accrue to the sport or to either club, was
the primary interest.
It was this consideration 'â  for the sport
which prompted the arrangement of a
meeting, yesterday afternoon between
Charies Albert. Adams, George H. Strat
ton and 'Frank W. Fuller, representing
the Olympics, and Frank H. Kerrigan,
Henry L. Day and Sanford Piummer for
the Bay Citys. The challenges made and
given on both sides were graciously with
drawn, all animus was laid aside and it
was mutually agreed that the efforts of
the clubs and their members would be
productive of much more good ii devoted
to the assistance of the California Associ
ated Cycling Clubs, which has just as
sumed the control of all cycling interests
in this State and has an immense amount
of work to do for the general good of the
sport.
The protest against the Bay Citysfor
allowing their man Kraft to be paced on
the ninth relay, will come up at a meet
ing of the association to-night, but the
Bay Citys are sure they can prove this
charge erroneous, and after that the
troubles of the great relay race of 1897 will
be at an end. >
Australian Baseball . Team.
Hard practice Is in order with the Kangaroo
Baseball team that is to try. conclusions with
the Olympics at Central Park next Sunday."
Since their arrival here they have greatly im
proved, and When they play their first match
a good exhibition can b? expected. '
The team will probably line up in this man
ner: Wallace or McKay, catcher; Kemp,
pitcher; Laner, first base; Engleton, second
base; McAlister, third base; 'lrwin, shortstop;
Carter, left Held; Stuckey, center field; Ewers
or Over, right field.
The inhabitants of the United States
consume more than half the quinine pro
duced in the world.' *.

TO HER MOTHER
Judge Seawell Reverses His
Decision in the Hol
strom Case.
A Scene of M xed Joy and Sor
row in Court Took Place
Yesterday.
Tears of Regret end Exaltation Over
the Rsu t of the Great
Kidnaping Case.
There was a scene of mixed joy and sor
row in Judge Seawell's court yesterday,
when an order was made transferring the
guardianship iof little Effie V. R. Hol
strom fiom Mrs. Lucinda Holstrom, her
foster mother, to Mrs. Sarah d'Artenay,
her mother. MSS-H
The little girl over whose custody the
contest was made joined in the lamenta
tions of her foster-mother, and the ser
vices of several special officers were re
quired to keep the manifestations of ex
citement within bounds.
If there be any parents who are slack or
cold in devotion to their lawfully begot
ten children they would there have re
ceived a lesson impressing them with tbe
love which is sometimes felt for illegiti
mate offspring, as well as the devotion
and affection that is aroused in the heart
of foster-parents.
The present case promises to be hi stori
cal in Californian jurisprudence, as the
Supreme Court will be called on to finally
dispose of the questions involved.
Mrs. d'Artenay applied for letters of
guardianship, alleging berseif to be th*
mother of the child and able to properly
rear and care for it.
It appeared from the records that Effie
was born out, of wedlock, and that when
the little one was 6 days old Mrs. d'Arte
nay, then known as Miss Sarah Maguire,
signed a paper relinquishing all right to
the possession of the child forever and
giving it to Mrs. Holstrom of Empire
City, Or., to adopt and rear as her own.
It was under the authority of this paper,
and the fact that she bad cared for the
child from its infancy, that Mrs. Holstrom
claimed the right to its custody.
In the earl y stages of the controversy
Officer Frank Kane of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children took
forcible possession of the child by enter
ing the home of Mrs. Holstrom without
a warrant and carrying the child there- | and there is no reason to doubt that in a short

CENSUS FRAUD
BUBBLE EXPLODED
School Director Waller
Makes a Manly Ex
planation.
Discrepancies Due to Errors and
Not to Fraud as 'â 
Charged.
Outlying Districts Gladdened by the
Promise of Bet School
Facilities.
The census fraud bubble that was
foisted on a confiding. public as a genuine
sensation by an unreliable morning paper
burst with a crash at the meeting of the
Board of Education last, evening, leaving
its manuiacturer. Chief Census Marshal
Wardeil, high and dry. .
Chairman Waller of the Census Com
mittee reported progress and when re
quested by a member to explain the
pseudo sensation that had been published,
made a manly statement, in which he
said tbat Chief Census Marshal Wardell
was responsible for the mare's nest and
that the investigation had been con
ducted under the leadership of Mr.
Wardell.
He stated tbat the committee was satis
fied that the discrepancies in the old rolls
were the result of error and not of fraud,
and that if. was- quite as likely that as
many names were left out of the rolls as
were erroneously put in.
He stated that ex-Marshal Bausman had
demanded an investigation at the hands
of the Grand Jury, and that the present
Marshal bad been summoned to substan
tiate bis marges.
Mr. Waller's tone indicated that the
committee had washed its bands of the
matter and was willing to let Wardell get
out of the predicament he had placed him
self and the committee in as gracefully
as he is I C^l|j|[]|TO|.teg
The representatives of various outlying
districts that have been, asking for bettor
school facilities were gladdened by a re
port rendered by Chairman Burns of
the Buildings and Grounds Committee, in
which the following recommendations
were made: ;-â _â¢Â£. ';â _
That an eight-class brick building be built
on the present site of the Madison Primary
School building that an 8-room brick building
be erected in the Richmond district on the
present Sutro school site, and that two classes
be added to the Richmond School building, on
First avenue; that a four-class building be
erected in the vicinity of the Preclta Valley;
that a four-class building be erected on the
two lots donated by- the residents of Sunny
side; that an eight-room school building be
erected on the present site of, the Monroe
School building; that a committee be ap
pointed to appear before the Finance Commit
tee of the Board of Supervisors. to ask for a
special appropriation for ;he erection of the
buildings specified. â :â¢
Chairman Charles A. Bantel of the Com
mittee on Supplies, submitted a vigorous
protest against the small amount allowed
the committee for the purchase of school
supplies. He contended that the appro
priation for March should have been $1300,
instead of the $700 that was allowed, in
order to meet the actual requirements of
the committee. -He asked > that the ap
propriation be: placed nt $2000 per month
in order to supply* all the poor with the
articles that they, cannot afford to buy,
and stated that if he did not get a suffi
cient appropriation he would decline to
purchase supplies in excess of the amount
allowed. He stated that the bill lor coal
alone was $1000 per month, and that the
other necessities would easily make up
the $-000.
Chief Census Marshal Wardell was
allowed $75 for fifteen days' work performed
in making a recapitulation of last year's
school census rolls. The charges recently
made by Mr. Wardell were based on what
he claimed was ex-Census Marshal Baus
man's recapitulation, but the board saw
tit to pay for a new one. j "*

The Local League to Raise Funds

Encouraging News From the New

; b ns' Battle for Freedom.
The Cuban League of San Francisco de
cided last night to give a picnic on the
30th of next month for th* purpose- of
raising additional funds for tbe assistance
of the patriots who are battling for the
freedom of Cuba. Acting upon the recom
mendation of the executive; committee,
the league selected Wildwood Glen, near
Sausalito, as the objective point of the
proposed . excursion. . President J. H.
Jones was given until Saturday to name a
committee of seven, which" will lake
charge of all the. arrangements for the
outing. -The money accruing from this
affair will be forwarded to the New York
Junta, there to be devoted to whatever
purpose the Cuban sympathizers deem
most expedient. .
: A letter from the Cuban League head
quarters â at New York was -read at last
evening's meeting. It was most encour
aging in its references to the revolution
ists' prospects, but gravely reminded all
sympathizers, no matter where they are,
that they must not permit their enthusi
asm nor their duties as regards contribu
tions to lag in the least if they hope to see
the cause of liberty- triumphant. The
local league is also asked to be industrious
in the matter ot seeing that auxiliary
leagues are formed throughout the State,

Shirek & SRirek, the furniture and car
pet dealers of 747 Market street, are in
grave financial difficulties, and have been
forced to the wall by impatient creditors.
The head of the firm has executed a bill
of sale to' L N. Walters of the firm of D.
N. &E. Walters, the wholesale furniture
dealers, and * the business of the concern
will be wound- up as soon as possible for
the benefit of the creditors. The firm ad
mits liabilities of between $8000 and $9000,
and claims assets, consisting. of stock,
amounting to $6003, but it is asserted that
the stock will not realize more than $2500.
A stormy meeting of creditors and of
the members' of the -insolvent firm was
held at the Board of Trade rooms yester
day, and when it was over it was seen that
the firm was hopelessly involved. . ,
I (The creditors .demanded to know what
had become of $2030 which had been re
ceived from the insurance companies to
cover losses by fire incurred a few weeks
ago, and Sigiried Shirek told them that
he bad. paid it out on debts that were
pressing him.
Close questioning elicited the informa
tion that $800 of the amount had been paid
to Shirek's wife* and $1100 to a relative,
the furniture roan claiming that he owed
them to that extent. This transaction is
to be closely inquired into. Shirek denied
that he bad known that he was about to
fail when be paid out the money.
I. N. Wallers stated that Shire_* had
i agreed to pay each of his main creditors
' something on ._ account when the insur
: ance money was collected, but bofore they
j could get around to see him he had dis
posed of the funds. ,
It was â¢at first intended to bring pro
ceedings against Shirek on a charge of
concealing his property from, bis credit
ors, and this may yet be done, but the
j matter was temporarily postponed by tbe
' making of the bill of sale mentioned.
, : Proceedin_s in involuntary insolvency
will be begun, however, and , an "effort
made to save as much as possible for the
creditors. ''â ''' .'... r. ' : .r
The heaviest creditors are D. N. & E.
Walters, $1100; J. Hoey & Co., $700;
& Co., $600.
The creditors are anxious to know how
it is that a firm that seemed prosperous
should become involved, and it is said
that other transactions aside from the
matter of the insurance money will be
looked into.
The Durand Furniture Company of 1433
Mission street was attached yesterday on
a claim held by J. J. Rimer, and it is said *
will be compelled to go -into insolvency.
Tbe stock amounts to about $1500, with

Shaved by a -Sleeping Man.
A rather â ; remarkable .'< xperience hap
pened to me last August during my stay
in a Northern seaside resort. Early one
morning I went into a hairdresser's shop
in a main thoroughfare for a shave.
Only one assistant was there at tbe time,
and after the usual greetings as to the
weather, etc.. proceeded 'quietly with, his
work. When he had finished operating
on m he again took up . his .' lather-brush
and was about to recommence. I caught
his band and told him one shave at a time
was enough. .;;.:>. ' ;; ': -.â >â "... -. -/-.*.
The man started and looked thoroughly
scared, and apolog zed, saying be remem
bered me sittinir down in the chair, and
then while lathering me he had gone to
sleep and had shaved me mechanically,
not knowing what h> had done. He went
on to say he had been up ail night nurs
ings sick child.
You may be' sure I felt uny thing-, but
comfortable at ihe Ujotis:ht" of .having
been shaved t>\- a man "â¢_ asleep.â Catsell's

OF THE PULPIT"
Dr. Boyer of Chicago to
Hold a Revival in
Oakland.
He Is Also Known as the "In
gersoll of the Church" in
the Press of the East.
His Resemblance to the Actor and
His Dramatic Fcrc2 Have Greatly
Aided H m in His Work.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, April 14. J
Dr. Thomas Boyer of Chicago, wbo is
well known as the "Edwin Booth of the
Pulpit," will commence a series of special
services next week at the Central Christian
Church.
For several months efforts have been
made by the board of trustees of the
church to induce the celebrated dramatic
DR. THOMAS BOYER of Chicago, Who Is Known as the
" win Booth of the Pulpit."
Evangelist to come , to Oakland, and for i
the greater part of this time they were un
able to obtain a favorable reply.
Now, however, they have just received
â word that Dr. Boyer will be in Oakland
next Monday night. Daring his ten years
in the pulpit Dr. Buyer has added 10.000
members to the church, and this is owing j
it is said as much to his great dramatic
ability in the pulpit as to the power of the
gospel which he preaches.
He began leaching school when he was
but 16 years of age, and three year* later
resigned that position to accept a pro
fessorship in an Illinois college. After
ward he directed his attention to the
study of law, finally forsaking that pro
fession for ecclesiastical research which
terminated in his becoming an evangelist.
"While in Cnicago," said Rev. Edwards
Davis to-day, "Dr. Bover w*s cilled the
'Ingersoll of the church.' This title was
given him because of the aptness with
which he answered many critical ques
tions hurled at him from large audiences
by learned and experienced atheists.
"Only six years have passed since be
was fully ordained, and it was only after
his friends had used a great deal of per
suasion that he adopted the evangelical
method of proclaiming the gospel. In
personal appearance Mr. Boyer is tail,
with a faultless figure and a refined face
Capable of great exprsssion. Without be
ing sensational in the pulpit he possesses
Bnd it is impossible for' him to conceal, a
decided dramatic power. His resemblance
to Edwin Booth is very noticeable, and
his sermons are direct, learned and con
v.ncing. Yet he works in occasional
touches of humor that please bis audience !
and seem to add. to his magnetism."
The special services wiil beheld every I
night except Saturday at Hamilton Hail. !

lowing address to the merchants and busi- |
ness men of Alameda County:

lieve the money of its citizens should be ex

creasing the capital of our city and county and
; the thrlf tines* of our people.
We believe the keeping of such moneys in
our own city and county would be a great
factor ln solving the problem of unemployed
labor, for with the increase of trade in our
own limits would come a demand for more
labor. , .*.â â ., ;
We believe the thrift so gained by our city
ana county would be an inducement for the
ir.crea-e of manufacturing interests. The ob
jects of this association shall be tbe keeping
of trade in our. city and county; to seek the
co-operation of tbe merchants, tradesmen, and
all residents ,of the county to prevail tithe '

runs than in their last game together.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 15, 1897.
BUDD SPIES OUT
THE ESTUARY
The Governor and Party
Get Into a Small Boat
and Explore Creeks.
He Declared That the Trip Was
, Merely Oae of Pleasure and
Curiosity.
B.lieved to Be in Connection With
the Sanitary R quirements of
the Tidal Canal. *"v
â¢: . '
. Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 14. J
Governor Budd made a tour of the estu
ary to-day, and although he stated tbat it
was simply for pleasure it is believed that
his trip originated from some other mo*
tive. J.};;, WV 'Jil/J;
The Governor and a party consisting of
Dr. Morse of the State Board of Health,
Dr. Chalmers, San Francisco Quarantine
Officer, and J. T. Burke approached . the
Webster-street bridge in the Governor
Markham shortly before 10 o'clock.
The tug passed through the draws and
the Governor made a close inspection of
the bridges as the Governor Markham
steamed slowly through.
Alter looking at tbe bridges tbe tug
steamed as far as the new Adams
wharf, which seemed to possess great in
terest for the party. After going a short
distance above the wharf the tug turned
and made her way to the Webster-street
slip of the city wharf, where she was
moored. A boat was hailed from one of
the boathouses on the Alameda shore and
the party got into it. They then pro
ceeded along the Alameda snore and up
the small creek on that side for some dis
tance. The Governor asked many ques
tions, which plainly showed he had great
interest iv being informed regarding the
estuary, and alter rowing about three
miles the party returned to the Webster
street bridge and boarded the tug.
"The trip was only an outing," said
Governor Budd to a reporter, "and has no
significance at all. 1 merely wanted a
lutle trip on the bay, and I thought I
could enjoy myself this lovely morning
taking a good look at the estuary."
All other questions failed to produce
any information, aud a few moments after
the Governor boarded the 1115 the party
steamed out of the estuary and made for
San Francisco under full speed.
On account of the peisonneiof the party
it is believed that the Governor's trip was
in some way connected with the sanitary
condition of the estuary. Dr. J. C. Mc-
Lean of Alameda is also a member of the
State Board of Health, and he has just re
turned from Washington after trying to
secure as a sanitary measure the construc
tion of the tidal canal at the Alameda end
of the estuary, for the purpose of having
tidewater pass completely around the
island of Alameda every flood tide. No
definite information, however, could be
obtained from any of the party.
THEY SPRING SURPRISES
Berkeley Athletes Held Their
Last Try-Out B.iore the
Intercollegiate.
Drum Snatches the Hundred . Yard
Dash From Barnes and Dorn
Throws Remarkably
BERKELEY, Cal,, April 14. âThe uni
versity athletes held their final try-out
field day this afternoon, prior to the inter
collegiate meet. Several surprises were
.prong, chief among which was the win
ning of the 100-yard dash by Drum from
Barnes, who has thus far this season been
considered to have a "cinch" on the
sprints. Drum covered the distance in
10 2-5 sec, though two watches caught him
at 10 1-5. Humphreys took the 440-yara
in 53 1-5 sec, thus approaching the record
by a second.
The 880-yard run was an easy first for
Carroll, who made it in 2 minutes 4 4-5
seconds. Dorn ma<le tbe remarkable dis
tance of 135 feet 10 inches in the 16-pound
hammer throw. He has had but little
training of late, having only commenced
to practice within the last ten days. Tom
Carroll, the professional, cave an. exhibi
tion throw, making 155 feet. Lloyd
reached 10 feet 11 inches in the vault,
which is three inches better than he has

SACRAMENTO'S LIGHT.
Alameda's Experience With Municipal
Ownership of Her Electric-Light
Plant Wanted as a Guide.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 14. â Mayor
Hubbard of Sacramento. has written to
the authorities of the j city of Alameda
asking for full information with regard to
this city's ownership of its electric light
lain. Tbe information will be furnished
by City Clerk Laruborn, who is an enthu
siastic advocate: of municipal ownership
of all public utilities. It appears -that
there is a sort of -combination: in Sacra
mento to charge the city over $11 a month
apiece for .'. lights, and >- the Mayor thinks
-his is too much. \ In Alameda the cost to
the city for similar lights is about $7 and
the electricity.used here is generated - by.
steam, while . that â¢at :'; Sacramento ;; comes
from - the State power : plant at Folsom,*
where the fluid can be generated at far
less cost than when steam Is used. r
.;:, Fraitvale After Light -J
ALAMEDA, Cal.', April 14.â people
of Fruitvale want to get* supply of eiec
tricity from Alameda's plant and have
commenced negotiations with that object
in view. At present they,- obtain light
from the electric railway plant, but they
complain that tie service is poor and in
termittent,'and they; will try to change
the source of supply, to Alameda.
A Peacemaker In Trouble.
ALAMEDA. Cal., April 14.â J. E. Mor
rissey. of East Oakland pot , into a lot of
trouble yesterday. while acting as peace
maker between mother ana son. He
heard cries of distress coming from a store
on Park street, apparently emanating
from a woman, and rushed to her aid.
He says he found' Valentine Humphrey
striking his rnotlur, and thereupon a row
ens ed between the men,- which ended in
both being arrested for disturbing the
peace. When the case came up this morn
ing MrÂ«. Humphrey denied point blank
that her son had struck her, and Mr. Mor
rissey vows that no woman in distress
shall ever receive his chivalric aid again.
The 'Saloon Vote.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 14â An analy
sis of the vote cast by the different pre
cincts on the saloon' question on Monday
shows some interesting > facts. .'There ie a
total registration in this city of 36G4. yet
over 1500 voters failed to go to the polls.
The highest number, of voles cast for any
one office was 2107. On he saloon ' ques
tion there were 1903 votes cast, with a
majority all told of but 83 for the saloon.
There is, of course, no means of ascer
taining the sentiments of the non-voters,
but the division of sentiment is so close
that it is not considered probable that the
Trustees will take any action in the prem
ises one way or the other.

DEACON JONES'
UN IQUE PETITION
Files a Portrait of His
Many Little Ones as
Proof of His Need-
Wants to Mew the Lawns in
the Parks Controlled by
the City.
Thinks It Will B: Better to Give
Him a J b Than to Extend
Charity to Him. .
Oakland Office San Feancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 14. )
Deacon Sam Jones of the Beth Eden
Baptist Church filed, a petition to-day
with the Board of Works for a position as
city gardener. In its entirety this peti
tion is the most unique document ever
recorded at the City Hall.
Deacon Sam wants a job very badly.
He has a family of seven little children,
tbe eldest of whom looks to be about 8
years of age. Sam naturally concluded
I that if be put forward in a concise man-
ncr the nature of the claim upon his
labor the Board of Works would be favor
ably impressed in his behalf.
After taking advice upon the sub
ject with his .better half it was
decided tbat an illustrated petition
would have more weight than a
holographic document. Sam therefore
mustered all his family, tooK them to a
photographer, grouped 'them so that they
would appear to the best advantage, aud
with his petition inclosed a cabinet photo
of the Joneses. f^_9Pâ¬H-B*VV'^-6**@_4
â¢ All the Utile people are intelligent and
appear to be well fed and well cared lor
and tho deacon is very proud of them.
When he filed his petition this morning
he had a little conversation with Harry
Thomas, secretary of the Board of Public
Works, and asked that official if be
thought it would be better for him (Jones)
to bring bis family in the flesh to the
City.. Hall*.' to urge his- claim. Harry
Thomas looked around and noted tne
somewhat cramped quarters of the Board
of Public Works and told Mr. Jones that
be thought the photograph would answer
the purpose equally as well.
A little later Mr. Jones got the ear of
Mayor Thomas and with the aid of the
photogiaph be tried to convince the
Mayor that it would really be a good
thing if the job of mowing the city's
lawns for- $75 a month should fall
J ones ward. The Mayor thou.ht so, too,
but being a politician he did not say. so,
but assured Mr. Jones tbat bis petition
would be duly considered by the board, of
which Mayor Thomas is chairman.
Tne deacon did some canvassing this
afternoon after filing his petition and was
evidently impressed with the value of his
family picture. ;. He carried it around
town and with its aid secured many signa
tures to be ultimately added to hie peti
tion. '."â¢-'
. This matter of city gardener is one
which needs to be handled very carefully
at the City Hail. Last year the coveted
position wa_ sought by Msyor Pier.on,
one of the brethren, but he was opposed
by one element of colored society and as a
result Editor Wilson of the evaior was
sued for libel for declaring that "Brother
Pierson was no go. d and did not know a
cactus from a horned toad." Deacon
Jones declares that although his ideas of
botany were not gained in the State Uni
versity, he knows enough to mow lawns,
sweep sidewalks and pick out weeds, as
j well as trim the solitary flower, that are
to be found in the city's parks.

gave out that Mr. Cidogan was going to

Quarantine ' Officer Jordan Too Late to

When the' steamship Monowai arrived
last week her white passengers were in
spected by Immigration Commissioner
Stradley, who found that everything was
all right so far as his duty was concerned.
; Dr. Jordan, Federal Quarantine' Officer,
did not show up, and the passenger* being
impatient at the altogether unnecessary
delay clamored to be let ; ashore. They
were all' in first-class health, but Chief
.Customs Inspector Holmes had notified
the gangplank: inspector and the captain
and the purser of the vessel not to allow
any passengers ashore without permission
from Dr. Jordan.
Dr. Jordan seemed to' have been 'lost,
and the passengers clamored .so . loudly
against being detained unnecessarily,
some of them threatening suits for dam
ages, that Captain Howard, captain of the
dock, assumed the responsibility of land
ing the passengers. .
Deputy Surveyor Ruddell was the cus

SHAM INFANTRY FIGHT.
Troops at Presidio Perform the
"Defile Defense" Ma
neuvers.
'.
They Are Fitting Themselves for the
Field Days Next Weekâ The
-New Grand Stand.
' At the Presidio reservation yesterday
morning there was some lively mock
skirmishing between two divisions of in
fantry. It was merely a part of the regu
lar tactical drills, but the soldiers pre
tended to attack each other with so much
enthusiasm and fired with such vigor as
to make it quite exciting to the civilians
who watched the mimic war.
Four companies were engaged in the com
bat; two had the task of doing what
soldiers call defending a defile, and the
other two tried to destroy them.
If it bail been real battle the attacking
party would have swept the road clear of
the opposing force, but both bides played
their parts with si-ill and all the courage
the occasion required.
The troops are lakme '. an especial inter
est in the exercises this week because next
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday will be
field days and the wish is to make them
selves so perfect by practice as to give a
good display of military excellence when
they will have so many admiring specta
tors to watch the maneuvers. . .
Captain J. J. O'Connellwas the officer
who had in charge the planning of the de
file right. ,
Quite a number of people witnessed the
regular maneuvers of the. cavalry yester
day morning. . They were performing the
."monkey drill." The horses behaved well
when being shot over and the riders dis
played excellent horsemanship
The grand stand is rapidly being built
at the parade ground, and there will be
comfortable Beats for the women next
week from which to witness the athletic
contests. In addition to this work there
is much being done in the way of leveling
and beautifying the grounds. The show
of flowers out at the barracks is well
worth a visit to see, and the lawns and
walks are being put in fine order.
General Forsyth and bis staff boarded
the McDowell yesterday and went round
the bay and to Lime Point, presumably
for coast-defense study.

tournament at the Presidio to take place

RED WAX SCALE
FROM HONOLULU
Came Here From the Islands
on the Steamer
Australia.
Found on Wreaths Presented to
Passengers Before Leaving
for Home.
In Future All Such Presentations
Will B i Consigned to the Fur
nace by Mr. CraW.
The cabin passengers on the Oceanic
Steamship Company's Australia and In
spector Craw of tbe Horticultural Society
had a ''spat" yesterday. For years it has
been the custom to pass all the flowers
and wreaths presented to passengers on
the departure of the steamer from Hono
lulu.
In the "Paradise of the Pacific" the val
leys and hills are always covered with
wild flowers and creeping plants. The
gardens of the well-to-do are in bloom
from year's end to year's end, but unfor
tunately there is not much supervision,
and in consequence numberless pests have
found lodgment in the soil. Ferns, man
goes.and other South Sea island plants
have been thrown into the furnace on ar
riving here, and on one occasion a mag
nificent consignment ior the conservatory
of Claus Spreckels was destroyed on the
order of the Sugar King. The remark of
the latter was, when spoken to about the
matter by Mr. Craw, "Belter I should be
out a lew thousand dollars than that a
pest should be introduced into Califor
nia." It has made several attempts to
make a landing here, but on every occa
sion has been bellied by tbe vigilance of
Inspector Craw. \.";'lp"
When the Monorrai arrived here a few
weeks ago a number of pot plants and
lai- 1 , or wreaths, were consigned to the
furnace. When the Australia arrived ye?
terday Mr. Craw saw the red wax scale on
at least half a dozen wreaths, so he cut
off all tbe green foliage and left nothing
but the wilted flower." for the indignant
women. In future every wreath mat
comes from Hawaii will be consigned to
the furnace when it reaches San' Fran
cisco.
In order to understand the widespread
significance of thin ruling it must be un
derstood that it strikes at one of the roots
of Hawaiian custom. On leaving the
islands it is an established rule that the
staterooms of friends and relatives must
be duly decorated, and wreaths to crown
them must be at the wharf prior to the
vessel's sailing. Nearly all these flowers
and wreaths, if taken care of, will last un
til this port is reached, and, then the pas
sengers will chow them with pride to the.r
friends. Now tne edict lias gone fortn,
and no more Hawaiian wreaths will come
to San Francisco.
Every pgr.en leaf that comes here on the
next steamer irom Hawaii will be de
stroyed. The islands are invested with
bogs and a stringent quarantine i-Â» the
only thing ..that will keep them out of
California.
"Three years ago I wrote to Commis
sionerof Agriculture Marsden and pointed
out that the red wax scale had been carried
into Hawaii from India," said Inspector
Craw yesterday. "Tne answer I received
was that it was not doing mucL damage;
but now I can see plainly that it is
opreading, and the most stringent meth
ods must be taken to keep it out of Cali
fornia. It does not attack fruit, but it is
death to tbe leaves, and that means death
to 1 the tree. No more wreaths, no more
flowers, no more palm?, no more flower
ing plants, no more mangoes and no more
Tines of any kind tbat have the slightest
trace of the red wax scale on them will be
allowed to land. All will be consigned to
the furnace."

STAGING INTO THE YOSIMITE
TO BE REDUCED.
Benefit to a Great Mining Section
Oakdale and Cculterville the
Termini.
Construction work on a new railroad in
the "mother lode" counties of the Sierras
has actually begun, and within the next
few months a standard-gauge railroad 124
miles long wiil be in operation from Oak
dale, Stanislaus County, to Coulterville,
Mariposa County. :> , .;
Some time ago W. Bullock conceived
the project of constructing an electric line
as a feeder to the Valley road. The road
was to be known as the Sierra Pacific and
was to run into the heart of the mining
sections of Calaveras, Amador and Tuol
umne counties from Stockton. Rights of
way were secured and other preliminaries
were arranged, but ior some reason the
enterprise was not matured.
Meanwhile others, including Prince
Poniatowski, b?c_rae interested in the
idea of opening direct rail communica
tion into this district, and the result was
that Bullock transferred his rights of way
and other privileges to the new parties,
who incorporated and organized under
the title of the Sierra Railroad Company
of California.
Without flourish of trumpets those back
of the new company began work about
ten days ago, and to-day two miles of
track nave been laid and more than five
miles of the new road have been graded.
The construction work is in charge of the
Ericsson Bros., who have instructions to
push it with the utmost rapidity.
The proposed line will pass through
Jamestown, Angels and probably Sonora.
At the latter point there are some differ
ences over right of way. and should these
not be arranged to the satisfaction of the
projectors the line will be Duilt around
the town. For most of the remaining por
tion of the road the right of way is virtu
ally secured. At no point will there be
more than a _ per cent grade, and this
will be for a short distance only.
Two great objects it is claimed will be
accomplished by the building of this road.
It will give ready and direct access to the
mining country/which has hitherto been
reached only by a circuitous and incon
venient route, and will, among other im
portant things, permit of timber being
brought into the mining camps at a com
paratively low cost.
Sidney D. Freshman of New York is tbe
president of the company and John M.
Bonner is secretary. There is to be a
meeting of the stockholders shortly, when
the present board of directors and officers
will be replaced by an entirely new body
of men, from the president down.
An important step in connection with
the enterprise- was the recording yester
day by Jesse W. Lilienthal, the attorney
for the comnanv. of two chattel mortgages
as security for $3,720,000 wortn of bonds to
be issued by the company to raise funds
foi the prosecution of the work. The issue
of bonds was authorized by the directors
at a. meeting held on the 10th of April.
It will also reduce the staging into the
Yosemite Valley to one-third of what it is
to-day, even by the most favorable route.
Although it is claimed that the new
corporation is entirely independent of the
Southern Pacific, it is admitted that it
will serve as a leeder to that system, con
necting with the east side branch of that
company, as already stated, at Oakdale.
It is understood that when the Sierra
Railroad is in operation all the Yosemite
tourist travel will be diverted from the
present Southern Pacific route, via Ray
mond and Wawona, to the new line via
Oakdale, as most of the long stage ride,
now part of the trip, will-be avoided.
One is?ue of the bonds is to be for
$1,860,000, payable in gold, to run for forty
years, to bear 6 per cent, and for the pay
ment of which a sinking fund is to be
provided. These are secured by a first
mortgage on all the prouerty, rights and
privileges of the company now owned by
it, or which may come into its possession.
The other issue is for the same amount,
also bearing the same rate of interest and
to run for the same period- of time, and
are to be known as income bonds, that is
the interest is to be paid from the . income
of the road, but must not exceed 6 per
cent. This is secured by a second mort
gage, covering the same property- that is
specified in the first mortgage. The bonds
are already printed, and it is understood
that they are virtually already disposed
of. Including both mortgage!*, the line
will be bonded for about $30,000 a mile.
The Anglo-California Bank is to be the
depository of the sinking fund.

CREDITORS ARE LENIENT.
Coblentz, Pik* & Co. May Tide Over
Their Â£111 bar ran in '
The creditors of the embarrassed whole
sale liquor firm of Coblentz, Pise & Co.
developed a disposition yesterday to deal
leniently with the house rather than to
force it to the wall, and there now appears
to be a fair chance for it to survive tho
disaster and avoid insolvency.
This is practically ' the only new de
velopment in tbe unfortunate firm's
affairs since the publication in yesterday's
Call of its financial troubles.
T..e creditors have agreed that aggresive
measures at this time would result more
seriously for themselves than they had
previously anticipated. Besides, ihe
friends of Boa- Pik.\.,who since there
cent death of Joseph Coblentz has had
sole charge of the business, have come to
the front for htm en masse, and are using
every influence to obtain lor him a chance.
The firm's liabilities at ihe present time
will foot up nearly $109,000, but an ex
amination of the boots shows the firm has
good bills outstanding which will about
cover this amount.
Mr. Pike's i opularity in the business
would have much to do with the leniency
being accorded him. Beside*, if an im
mediate adjustment should be demanded,
scarcely over 25 cents on the dollar could
be realized by the creditors, whereas, by
exhibiting, a little patience, they might
realize consiaerable more. At least/this
is the conclusion thÂ«Â»y have reached of
their own accord, and Mr. Pike was notified
yesterday tnat he might continue to con
duct the business until further notice.
This means that no obstacles will be
thrown in his wav until after the probate
proceedings it connection with the Cob
lentz estate are sufficiently under wav to
determine whether or not there will be
any legal entanglements.
A SPEEDY MISSION CAR.
It Struck En ward L Levey's
Wagon and Crippled
Him.
Witnesses ho Testified That the
Motorman Was Contused and Made
No Effort to Stop
There was another interesting session of
the Edward L. Levey suit against the
Market-street Railway in Judge Bahrs'
court yesterday.
Yesterday's testimony tended to estab
lish the plaintiff's contention that the car
was going at a rate of speed greater than
is allowed by law, and that no warning of
the car's approach was given by ringing
a bell in accordance with the requirements
of the city ordinance.
In regard to the law to compel the ring*
ing of a bell, S. M. Shortridge offered in
evidence the city ordinance on that ques
tion. Attorney Charles L. Ackerman ob
jected on the ground that this matter had
not been specially pleaded. Argument on
this point was reserved until the testi
mony is ah presented to tbe jury.
Eugene Brackett, a teamster, testified
that he was on Mission street, going
toward Erie, when he saw Mr. Levey's
team approach the track. At that mo
ment the car was Irom 150 to 300 feet from
the wagon, going at a terrific speed. He
thought it was equal to fiiteen miles an
hour. The bell was not rung and no
warning was given. The car crashed into
the wagon while he was looking. There
seemed to be no attempt to stop the car..
He thought the gripman was confuse
A. Gunnison, driver of a drayage team,
testified that when the accident occurred
he was on Mission street, near Erie. He
saw the horses on the track when the car
was Bixty feet away. It was plunging
along at the rate of something more than
twelve miles an hour. He beard no bell,
and could not perceive that any effort
was put fort i by the gripman to slow
down. The speed was not noticeably
diminished until after the collision.
After it struck the wagon the car went
fifty feet before it was stopped. The man
in the wagon, Mr. Levey, was thrown
headlong to the grouud. ",
Joseph H. icholl-, a milk-dealer, was
sworn as a witness on behalf of the de
fendant. He was not asked in regard to
the excessive speed of the car. In fact, it
was noted that none of the witnesses for
the railroad corn-any were called on to
give opinions on that point. Mr. Nich
olls said that he was standing on the front
dummy of the car when the catastrophe
occurred. He saw Mr. Levey on the
ground and agreed with a remark by Mr.
Shortridge that it was a miracle the man
was not killed. The witness said he re
membered hearing the bells of the car
ringing for the purpose of warning the
occupant of the wagon. He also heard
several men shout for the driver to look
out, but couldn't say whether he shouted
or not. He thought that the car went
not more than six .feet after striking the
wagon.
John Bunker, a paver, testified ' that .he
was repairing the track on Mission streei.
tween Fourteenth and Erie, and that he
was not injured by the car as he thought
he would have been if the car had gone
any great : distance * after striking the
Wagon. ' . ' â¢ ' - â  ':' '.;*;.'.
It is expected- that; the argument of
counsel will be heard to-day and that the
case will go to the jury this evening. '

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 15, 1897.
WON ON A NEW
POINT OF LAW
Santa Rosa Will Have to
Pay Her Water Works
Bonds.
Important Decision Rendered by
Judge Morrow in the Cir
cuit Court.
It Means the Saving of About $150,000
to the S.-ligmans of New
, York.
In eiving judgment in favor of the Sel
lgmans of New York for $11,000, principal
and interest due on bonds issued by the
city of Santa Rosa, Judge Morrow on
Monday, last passed upon a novel point in
law raised by Jesse W. Lilienthal, the at
torney for the New York bankers.
It was claimed by Lilienthal tbat where
a tax had been levied and collected for a
specific purpose, no taxpayer, bad tbe
right, subsequent to such levy and collec
tion, to intervene for the purpose of pre
venting the application of the money so
raised to the payment of the indebtedness ;
for which the fund was created.
When the city of Santa Rosa decided to
construct its own water works instead of
purchasing the plant of Mark McDonald
and those interested with him, it author
ized the issuance of $165,000 worth of
bonds, which were bougnt by the Sel ig
mans. . â â ' :
The. first lot of bonds matured in Decem
ber, 1895, aud were duly paid, and also in
terest on the entire issue to tbat date.
In the meantime five or six different
suits were brought by McDonald to re
strain tbe work of construction on the
new plant and to restrain tbe city from
paving the interest on the bonds and the
bonds when they matured. The suits
were first brought" in Santa Rosa. . .', -J-.-- r
Then on the plea that the judges there
were biased Judge Daingertield of this
City was selected to try the case. -After
tbat application was made lo remove the
case from . Sonoma to Marin County on
the ground that, the Sonoma County
judges were taxpayers and, therefore, in
terested in the matter to be adjudicated
upon. The matter was then transferred
to the court of Judge Angelotti.^_3Â£^Â£B_gg|
Last January Lilienthal, as attorney for
the bondholders, brought an action in the
Federal court for the amount due his
clients, making the city of Santa Rosa the
defendant. The defendant was given
thirty days to answer. After the answer
was filed Lilienthal made application to
Judge Morrow for judgment on the plead
ings.
Previous to this McDonald asked leave
to intervene on the ground that the city
of Santa Rosa was in collusion with the
bondholders, would not honestly defend
the suit, that the bonds were illegal, and
that whether or not the city was honest
he, as a taxpayer, had sufficient interest
to intervene.
At this stage of the proceedings the at
torney for the plaintiffs made the point
tbat, irrespective of any contention made
by the intervener and regardless of the
truth of anything he alleged, when the
bonds were allowed to be issued and the
tax had been levied and collected for the
purpose of paving those bonds, it is too
late for any 'taxpayer to complain.
Judge Morrow decided the case flatly on
this point and gave judgment for plaintiff.
Yesterday McDonald filed a bill in
equity to restrain the execution of the
judgment.
The next proceeding of the plaintiff will
probably be to ask for a mandamus order
ing the City Treasurer to satisfy the judg
ment out of tbe funds in his hands raised
by mean- of the special tax levy.

AGNEW WON AN
EASY VICTORY
Thompson Did Not Care
to Fight It
. Out.?
Greggains and Ste'zner Fought
Well but Ended in a
Draw. -
A Good Night's Entertainment Under
the Auspices of the Pac.fic
' Club.
The sports who witnessed the contests
at Woodward's Pavilion last evening : un
der the auspices oi the Pacific Athletic
Club retired more than pleased with th- |
entertainment. Tne first evdnt was an
eight-round go between a white
man named Goff and a colored
gentleman named Johnson, but Goff had so
much the better of the argument that the
bout was stopped in the sec md round and
the decision was given â¢in favor of Goff.
Referee Gilbert Pringle was selected to
decide the two "events of the evening." j
The first was a fifteen-round contest
between Lon A.new and Thompson, the
colored lightweight of Salt Late. This
was a first-class bout up to the eleventh
round, when Thompson fell in Aenew's
corner just as the gong sounded the end
of the round. ..-.-.â¢'-.
The blow he received was not a heavy
one, but the coon, for reasons best known
I to himself, thought that be had had
I enough of the game and concluded to go |
out by the ea-y route. The gong saved j
him for another round, and in the twelfth
he went down three times, and, although
he dropped the last time to his knees
without receiving a blow, he remained !
down until counted out.
It can be safely said that be either J
showed the white feather or was in- !
fluenced by gamblers to allow his op
ponent to win. He fought well up to the
time he fell. in Agnew's corner from n
slight jab in the mouth.
The next and last event was a twenty
round contest between Jack Stelzner and
Alex Greggains.
For the first twelve rounds Grt-ggains
scored a good lead. His blow.-, it is true,
lacked steam, but be continually kent his
glove on the left siae of Htelzner's face
until a bright red spot made its appear- i
ance on bis opponent's jaw.
Occasionally Sielzner landed a body
blow and a left which landed slightly on
Greggains'. nose, but' the fireman had cer
tainly all the better of; the argument up
to this point of the game.
In the thirteenth round the excitement
commenced, as the fighting was compara- |
tively tame up to this juncture. Stelzner,
prompted by his seconds to move in and* \
accomplish something, made a charge at i
his clever opponent, and in a rally he {
happened to land bis right on Greggains' |
jaw. The fireman staggered back and re
ceived a left hook under the ear, which
sent him to the boards.
Greggains regained his Dins before the
ten seconds were up and Stelzner rushed
at him like a mad bull.
. Greggains, who was in a partially dazed
state, ducked cleverly from right and left
swings aimed at his jaw and saved him
self from defeat by hard clinching.
Stelzner slashed at him wildly, but
failed to plant bis big bunch of lives on a
vulnerable spot.
The gong sounded and ; Greggains was
given another chance to redeem himself.
There was great excitement when the
fireman was hurried to his corner by his
seconds.
In the fourteenth round Stelzner made
another rush at his game, but Alec was
too clever and avoided . the swinging
blows and upper cuts by ducking- and
guarding. Finally Stelzner grew a bit
weary, and toward the end of the round
Greggains caught him ' two hard left jabs
on the /jaw, which dazed the famous
trainer of Bob Fitzsimmons.
Stelzner recovered from the effects of
the blow and landed a rignthookon Greg
gains' neck, the receiver landing up
against the ropes, almost gone; but Stelz
ner was so far exhausted that he could
not send home a finish blow and again
the gong saved Greggains. "
â When time was called for the fifteenth
round and zner toed the scratch,' his
left ear looked like a cauliflower. It
.was swollen to the size of a baseball, while
Greg.ains' left eye was almost closed.
Both men being weak from the fast fight
ing of the previous rounds there were only
a few exchanges in the round and no dam
age was done. J'J.'J,
. In the sixteenth round Btelzner made
one more attempt to land his right, but
Greggains ducked and sent his right
across, landing squarely on the point of
Stelzner's jaw and sending the receiver on
his back. *'._""*;.-.*'*'
The excitement now was intense, and
everybody was standing up and shouting
for Greggains. Stelzner was down seven
seconds, but when he got up and faced the
music he placed, his hands over his face
and protected himself from a knockout
until the bell came to his rescue. ' â¢'.**.
The seventeenth, eighteenth and nine
teenth rounds were uneventful, but in the
twentieth and last round Gre.gains forced
the fighting and opened Stelzner's cauli
flower with a stiff swinging right-hand
punch.
The blood flowed down Stelzner's shoul
ders and Greggains was looking for an
opening to send home ; the final touch
when the gong sounded and both men re
tired to their respective corners, tired and
satisfied that they had put up a good mill
that was satisfactory to the club and the
spectators. .;_ . ;,-. ;
'V.The referee decided that the contes.
was a draw, but although the decision was
-irly satisfactory it must be said that
Greggains had done all the leading and
had taken the offensive from first to last.
He certainly had a good .shade the bet
ter of the mill, and a decision! in his favor
would have been received with general
satisfaction. .'*'.'.. _
The contests were first call all round.
Jim Neal, the horseman, was one of the
audience at the fight, and when -he left
the arena he found some one hart picked
his pocket to the amount of $160 in coin
and notes. : Harry W. Waldon was locked
up at tbe Seventeenth-street station on
suspicion of being the thief.

Laid to Rest at the .
Presidio.
Many Beautiful Floral Offerings
Sent In by Her Near
Friends.
Short and Simp'e Reigicus C.re
monies at the Houssâ Only One
Relative Left.
Under the waving boughs of the green
trees, with the birds caroling their sweet
est lays and the warm April sun beaming
down and brightening up the face of na
ture, the mortal part of Mme. Mezzara,
the adopted daughter of Louis Philippe
and Queen Amelia, the last of the royalist
rulers of France, was laid away yesterday
afternoon..
â¢ .No ordinary burial ground was fit for
such as she â the woman who .nursed the
soldiers of the Union in their illness: and
distress, with no requiem for those whose
spirits took flight but the ceaseless roar of
guns and 'the loud bursting of shells.
And neither did she receive an ordinary
burial. jWWHBMWfIj^^
: She was laid to rest at the Presidio Cem
etery, side by side with those who gave, as
she, their lives in the service of * Uncle
Sam. And the soldiers gathered and
stood by hat in hand, listening to the last
sad rites as they were performed by the
minister.
At 2 o'clock the friends gathered at 1404
California street, ncr late residence, to do
honor 'to the dead woman. The services
were short and: simple. Rev. Dr. Wells
told in a few words the story, of the fam
ous .woman's life, and then gave a short
prayer for. the peace of her soul.
The rooms were beautifully/decorated
with flowers sent in by the dead woman's
lriends. : They were banked in prolusion
around and on " the casket, and . the air of
the room was heavy with their sweet, com
mingled odor. ...,
1 The - flowers were in 'various designsâ
crosses, wreaths, bouquets and solid banks.
Among those making floral offerings were
the pupils of Miss Hamlin's . school. Dr.
Charles Brie-ham, Mrs. Edward Hopkin?,
Mr. and Mrs: Homer S. King,* Miss Beard,
tbe French Zouaves, Mrs. Dinkelspiel and
Mrs. Huerl-. -
The pall-bearers were: G. W. Hindes,
Jules F. 'Hancock, A. C. Rulofson, L.Bo
rel, John F. Baldwin and J. W. Vendryes.
â¢ Only one relative in ; t his : City : survives
the ' deceased, Mme. Elizabeth , Cousin of
1125 Clay street.
At St. Mary's Church.
: The mass of 1 the presanctified will be most
solemnly celebrated at . St. Mary's Church,
California street, f to-morrow v. (Good Friday)
morning at 9 o'clock. The full ceremonial i of
the Catholic Church will be observed In- all its
details. The Passion will be lmnressively sung
by Fathers r Clarke, Powers - and Maynadier.
This service is considered as the most touching
and sublime of the church's year.
Suits for Divorce.
â¢ Two suits for divorce were filed ; yesterday-
Charles W. CUne against -Martha Cline for de
sertlon, and Mary B. Keenan against John F.
Keenan lor cruelty.

inst., and Colonel W. P.. Sullivan is doing
all in bis power to make this one of the
most striking events of the year. The
boys, too, have entered into the spirit of
the affair with vigor and are drilling when
ever time and opportunity permit.
Last evening several companies from
Oakland and this City held a practice drill
on Van Ness avenue, from McAllister street
to the foot of the hill. Four or five hun
dred were in line, led in their movements
by a fife and drum corps. The gathering
called together a large crowd that lined
both sides of the avenue.
The boys made a very creditable show
ins, whicn promises well or the perform
ance they are to give.* The drill was in
spected by Colonel Sullivan.

counsel for the prosecution, while Attor
ney Collins spoke on behalf of the de
fendant. The trial of this case occupied
nearly a month, involving the taking of a
vast amount of testimony. Judge Wal

that an early verdict would be secured.
