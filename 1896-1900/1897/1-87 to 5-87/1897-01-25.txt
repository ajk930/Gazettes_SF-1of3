BUT THE BRUTAL BUTCHERS
ARE PUNISHED.
Now the Captain-General Is Burning
All the Villages in His
Pathway.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 24.â A special
from Key West, Fia., says: Spanish guer
rillas surrounded Las Paimeras, twenty
miles south of Artemisa, at midnight and
filed all the dwellings. As the inmates
rushed out they were shot down, women
and children as well as men. Many per- !
ished in the flames rather than face the
Spanish bullets.
When morning came more than fifty
bodies were "-een among the ruins. The
guerrillas fled after looting trie two stores
which the flames had spared.
A Cuban band, attracted by the firing,
came up two hours later and started after
the Spaniards. Catching up to them a
light ensued and out of seventy guerrillas
thirty-five only escaped.
General W'eyler has burned four villages
since starting oat, warning the people to
move to the larger places, which are gar
risoned.
A special dispatch to the Herald from
Havana, via Key West, Fia,, says: The
ten officers of the garrison at Guanabacoa,
who were captured by the rebel, Aran
gueren, will be court-martialed, nine for
traveling unarmed in war time and one
for not resisting capture, though armed.
General Weyler's order that all owners
and managers of plantations who cannot
show a receipt for the payment of taxes
up 10 date must leave their plantations is
causing great hardships. The deserted
plantations are immediately sacked and |
ruined by marauders and irregulars of
both parties.
Cieiueacia Araguos, a girl of 29, a sister
of the rebel chiei, Araguos, was captured
to-day and probably will be placed in the
refuge for fallen women.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 21.â The authori
ties here ignore the Cometa affair, and it I
is impossible to learn from them what, if
any, iruth there is in the report thai the
little gunboat bad been destroyed by in
surgents. The military authorities pro
fess to Know nothing of the matter and in
this case their professions are believed to
be true, for in view of the antagonism be
tween the military and navy authorities
it is thought thai if the former were in
possession of facts detrimental to the
navy they would not hesitate to make
ti.em known to the genera! public. From
other official sources it is learned, how
ever, thai the reports that have already
reached the United States regarding the
loss of the guncoal aro correct.
The official reports issued to-day give
the details or" a number of engagements
between Government forces and rebels in
the provinces of Santa Clara, Havana,
Matanzas and Piiiar del Rio. According
to the*e reports the troops wereuniformlv
victorious.
Tlie rebel looses in the various engage
ments are placed at thirty-seven killed, a !
large number woumled and two captured, j
The insurgent camps, prefectures and
over 100 huts were destroyed. Many fam
ilies who had taken refuge in the woods
*e-e found by the troops and taken into
the towns.
The Spaniards say their losses were four
killed and a lieutenant-colonel, three cap

Notwithstanding the recent announce- (
ment of the "paci6cation" of the province [
of Pinar del Rio, o<iicial reports show that i
a greater number of eneagements referred
to took place in that province, which is
pretty good evidence that the rebels are
still conducting their operations.
The most important of the several fights
took place near Guines, province of Ha
vana, where the troops met the rebel
party led by Castillo and Delgado.

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 24.â A Key
I West special says: Another effort to kid
nap Major Fondeviella, "Weyler'a as
| sistant butcher," in command at Guana
bacoa, is reported from Havana.
An effort was made to capture him on a
train between Regla and Guanabacoa, but
it failed because be was not on board.
; This time a small band of rebels com
manded by an American named Welch,
one of the famous Texan s, went to Guana
bacoa, Wednesday and hid in a public
house near the town line where Major
Fondeviella'.-i train passed.
When his party reached the house it
stopped for liquid refreshment. Colonel
Fondeviella bad twenty men with him.
The insurgents rushed out, killing ten of
the escort and knocking several down.
The rest surrounded Fondeviella, while
one cavalryman galloped off for aid.
It was impossible for the Cubans to get
near enough to Fondevielia to knock him
down, but just as they were going to tie
him to his horse before galloping away
re-enforcements came. Welch seeing that
the attempt to kidnap was a failure
snapped his revolver in Fondeviella's face,
but it failed to go off.

BALTIMORE, Md., Jan. 24.â General
Carlos Roloff, Secretary of War of the
Cuban Provisional Government, and Dr.
Joseph J. Luis, who were eiven a.prelim
inary hearing in New York yesterday on
the charge of violating the neutrality
laws in connection with the shipment of
men, arms and ammunition to Cuba by
the steamer Woodall, will bo brought to
this city for trial. District Attorney Mar
bury said to-night that instructions had
been sent out to that effect from Wash
ington.
The reason assigned for the transfer of
i the case from New York to Baltimore was
! that the steamer Woodall was purchased
here and cleared from this port. Mr. Mar
bury will ask the United States Grand
Jury for an indictment against General
Roloff and Dr. Luis, and it is thought that
when they appear before Commissioner
Shields in New York next Saturday, they
will be turned over to United States Mar
shals and brought here.

BALTIMORE, Md.. Jan. 24â The
I American steamship Laureada, Captain
| Hughes, which has been leased by the
Cuban agents and representatives in this
country and which is said to have safely
landed a number of filibustering expedi
tious within the Cuban lines, is at Hamp

lemons from Palermo and Messina con
signed to this city.
The firm has not definitely decided,
owing to the dull condition of the market,
whether the Laureada will be ordered to
this port or to New York, Philadelphia or
Boston. The present commander, Cap
tain Hughes, is not the one who had
charge of the steamer when she is alleged
to have violated the neutrality laws. The
old captaiD left the Laureada at Palermo,
when she was ordered to sail for Valencia,
Spain, in the early part of December.

and Shelter.
Mercury From 25 to 40 Bslow in the
Northwestâ Tfiou ands of Cattle
and Sheep Perish.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 21â The cold
wave which reached Chicago last night
tightened its grip to-day, and at midnight
Chicagoans were shivering in a 16-below
zero atmosphere.
At 8 o'clock this morning the thermom
eter registered 14 below. The tempera
ture then moderated somewhat, but at no
time during the day did the mercury rise
above 3 below. Shortly after sunsut the
temperature began dropping rapidly, and
to-night promises to be a record-breaker.
The weather bureau promises no relief for
four or five days.
The suffering among the poor is intense,
and to-morrow morning Mayor Swift will
issue a proclamation, calling for bread fur
the starving.
According to the report made to the
Mayor by the Bureau of Charities and
other associations which have applied to
him, the number of destitute families is
increasing every day, until the condition
in â¢ <>me parts of the cily is appalling. Im
mediate relief is necessary or, it is said,
some will die from starvation and cold.
The police s ations all over the city are
filled with lodgers, hundreds of homes are
without iuel and food, and skilled work
men are begging on the streets.
Committees of charitable institutions
and many individual philanthropists have
called on Mayor Swift and urged him to
make an appeal to the public for immedi
diate help for the sufferers. He will issue
a proclamation to-morrow setting forth
the exact condition of the poor in Chicago
and will make an appeal for public help.
No actual cases of starvation have as yet
been reported, but many are suffering with
hunger. Distributions of food and fuel
have been carried on by the Bureau of
Charities, but they say they are unable to
take care of one-fifth of the people who beg
for assistance.
County Commissioner Beatty reported
to Mayor Swift yesterday that the lists of
needy are growing at the rate of from 300
to 500 families per day. These are not the
families of paupers, but the families of
skilled workmen, who are unable to get
work.
Last nicbt's blizzard continued until
early this morning, but there was no se
rious delay to streetcar traffic, as the
thoroughfares -were kept open by the hun
dreds oi men who were at work all night.
Many of those suffering from want were
given an opportunity to earn a few pen
nies by clearing away the snow.
All trains are late, hut the delay is not
serious.
Through the suggestion of Major Swift, j
Chief of Police Badeuoch issned an order
to-night which will facilitate the furnish
ing of relief to such as nre in danger from
want of food or fuel. The patrolmen
throughout the city were ordered to make
reports on all cases of extreme destitution
and explain the character of relief re
quired. On all such reports immediate
assistance will be rendered.

Blood Fever Being Worked
Up Among the Friends of
Little Pete.
THE PITIFUL PLIGHT OF HIS
WIDOW.
King Owyang, the V ce-Consul, Has
B.en Threatened, and It Is Feared
He Will Bi the Next
Tbe ephemeral sensation of an.ordinary
Chinese murder has no place on the list
with the feverish anxiety,Â»bitter vindic
tiveness and cuss-dog deviltry that have
been engendered through the cold-blooded
assassination of Little Fete Saturday night
in Chinatown.
That brainy little heathen, connected as
he was with the most powerful element*
among hi* own people, being a man of
wealth, haying almost intimate acquaint*
ancesbip with the social, financial and
political classes among the whites, could
hardly be shot down without a word of
warning without his killing assuming
greater importance than any of the hun
dreds recorded on the mortuary tablets of
former years.
Little Pete was better known among his
own people and the Americans of this
State than any Chinaman in the local col
ony, but where he was most cherished,
and where the weight of his counsel was
besi felt and most needed was rieht in the
chambers of the Sam Y up Company, of
which he was a leader.
What will the Sam Yup people do now
to avenge his death? Those who, iika
Captain Lees and his officers, have studied
the ways of the heathens during three de
cades of blood-spilling, and who know
these almond-eyed queue-bearers to blend
in their constitution the vendetta of the
Corsiean and the love of lucre which
causes Italian brigands to take the life of
non-combatants upon whose head a price
is set, look forward to troublous times in
Chinatown.
Already the regular squad of six men
has been increased to two score and even
with that force of guardians the peace is2
but a travesty upon the same and there is
a likelihood of an ou break at any mo
ment upon the slightest provocation or
Done at all.
The situation is positively alarming
more so than ever before â because the
contending factions instead of being little
siae ramifications as in days gone by are
the two representatives of the entire Chi
nese lopu.ation. Jour-fifths of the latter
are among the poorer classes from the dis
tant provinces far outside of Canton.
They are the See Yups. They are made
up principally of the Sun Wing, Sun
Woy, Hoy Ping and Ymg Ping families.
Only a few days ago a member of 'he
latter family was shot down and killed on
Jackson street, ten minutes after he had
engaged ir. a wordy war with friends of
Litile Pete, in whose gambling- house the
disagreement occurred.
The other factionâ the Sam Yupsâ con
sists mainly of the Puon Yee, Sing Duck
and Nam Hoy families, residents of Can
ton or its immediate suburbs. These are
tbe wealthy Chinese here and among
whom Little Pete was the leading light.
The See Yups, strong in their numerical
position, chafed under the yoke of the
Bam Yups and, a yeÂ»r ago, they withdrew
from the Chinese Six Companies, em
ployed Campbeb, Reddy and Metson to
set them runt in a legai way and imme
diately set about incorporating firms in
every line of business calculated to be in
opposition to the Sum Yups.
It was ihe old story of the boycott, with
more horrors than such aff irs have ever
brought about id the old wona. Murder al
ter niuruer has been committed until the
wealthy men have mostly withdrawn iheir
capital from tbe channels of commerce,
leaving the See Yups and their new estab
lishments in power. Aanost alone Little
Pete braveJ the opposition. His shoe
manufacturing tirm, under tne name of J.
C. Peters & Co., the largest and most pros
perous in Chinatown, refused to close its
doors. His gambling interests were great
enough to help him financially to tide
over the lack of patronage and income
caused by the boycott, and he felt strong
enough to again rally about him the weak
ones among the Sam Yups to eventually
down the contending faction.
Guarded day and night by four Chinese,
two of whom were well-known "fighting
men," ana one white man named C. H.
Hunter, a special policeman, Little Peie
nursed bimseli into a feeling of security.
He became reckless to the extent of going
forth alone af times, chaffing his guards
with kindly meant assertions that they
acted like so many old women, ana that
there was no danger that any one wouid
try to molest him.
But Pete went out alone once too often.
He was watched by bis assassins and most
cruelly put to death when be was found
to be unprotected.
However, his death will not end the
fend. Chinatown is afire with passion
and venom. The wealthy Sam Yups, with
as little regard for social customs and the
rieht of individuals to live their allotted
lease of lifa as nave their enemies, are
already sending out to interior towns for
fighting men who will come here and
Bland off, it not annihilate, the highbinders
in and employed by the See Yups.
Placards in flaming red are posted on
the bulletin boards in the Mongolian quar
ter. They mate most interesting reading,
no doubt, for the dirty scum of Chinatown
gathers about with bloodshot eyes and
nervously twitching fingers, drinking in
their meaning.
The police oieak up these gatherings as
often as tney occur. Still, the scattered
vermin, with nothing but gain to be se
cured by murder and rapine, go down the
street a little mrther and read tne incendi
ary posters there.
These Chinese anarchists, belonging to
either faction or to neither, quarrel and
glare at eacn other with murderous looks
and would welcome tbe opportunity to
cut throats at to much a cut."
All Chinatown knows this and so do the
police, who suggest to the white popu
lation to refrain for a while lrom offering
themselves as targets to stray bullets mat
may fly at any moment between the
warring Chinese.
That the venom displayed between the
Yups is more acrid than any heretofore
engendered, is apparent from the fact that
it has come to the surface at this time.
Usually, the Chinese bury the hatchet in
January, and seldom if ever do they
attempt or do murder just prior to or
during their New Year holidays. Their
festivals will begin on February 1 and,
under circumstances less aggravated than
those existing, Little Pete might have
expected one more mouth's lease of life.
The crack of the pistol has been heard,
however, Little Pete is dead, and tbe lifo
of his friend, King Ow Yang, the Vice
consul, is threatened, so it is not lively
that the spirit of assassination will stay
put with the funeral 01 the last victim on
Tuesday next.
It King Ow Yang manages to make bis
exit from this world of care and strife with
no physical disfigurement he will have
accomplished much, if tbe signs of the
limes speafc for anything. But this iact is
not worrying the Consul-General a lit
tle bit.
"There are many more men in China
capable of filling this office," he remarkep
with a laugh. "If thej succeed in laying
me beneath the sou somebody else with
perhaps a less amiable disposition may be
sent to fill the office."
AT THE MORGUE.
Pathetic Visit of the Widow and
Her Little Boy.
The officials at the Morgue were be
sieged by hordes of visitors ail during the
day. Seldom has a murder case attracted
such a multitude of inquirers as that of
this notable Chinaman, and the cariosity
mongers clamored to gaze at his body.
In this they were mostly disappointed.
It was a strange aggregation oi human
ity that called at the City's charnel-nouse.
They were not all prompted by morbid
curiosity. Hundreds of his Chinese
friends called to gaze at their dead com
rade. They made no complaint wnen
iney were in formed the body was not on
exhibition. Stoiidly they retraced their
steps.
There were white men among the
callers, too, men ot influence and promi
nence in the community. They nad nad
business dealings with the little nabob of
the Chinese quarter and they were not
ashamed to ca.l mm tueir friend. They
lingered to tell anecdotes of the little
Cele-tial, and they illustrated traits lv his
character which his public record has not
hitherto di*clo?ed*
"I have known Little Pete for years, "
said Robert Ferral. "I have prosecuted
him ana be has been my client, but I
have never once known him to break his
word."
It was a pathetic scene when Fong
Ching's widow, bis brother, Fong Shun,
and the decedent's little boy called at
the Morgue. When Fe e was stricken he
bad on bin person a gold watch, a mag
nificent diamond ring and a iew trinkets.
The Coroner did uot desire to be the
custodian of these articles any longer
than possible, but, to protect himself, he
refused to deliver them to auy one but the
widow. Accompanied by two women
inenils, her brother and her little boy, she
called o claim her husband's property.
The widow is not prepossessing from a
Caucasian point of view. Sue is short of
stature, inclined to fleshiness and plain of
feature.
With the stolidity of her race she ap
proached the Coroner's desk. She watched
with no apparent emotion While one by
one her husband's effects were counted
out and receipted for. Mechanically she
put her hand to the pen us the Coroner's
deputy guided ii to make her mark,
The trinkets were placed in a paper-ban,
all but the dinmoud ring. It contained a
dazzling brilliant ox extraordinary, value.
Little Pete Was Vety Proud of This Picture, Which Shows Himself, the Second From the Left, and All of His Near Relatives.
The deputy hesitated about placing It in
so frail a receptacle. The woman's hand
rested on bis desk and be slipt ed tbe ring
on her finger. She eid it up and gazed
at it a moment. The ring had been con
st^niiy worn upon ncr husband's finger.
Perhaps it recalled memories which even
a Mongolian woman chenshe-t as sacred.
It opened tbe floodgate of her tears. She
shrieke I her rief and fell writhing upon
the Moor. Her female companions joined
in her wailings, and the brother stood
helplessly by, while tears rolled down bis
face. At the Morgue the attendants are
accustomed to scenes of grief, but as the
mourning woman was gently urged away
by her friends the conversation did not re
sume its usual frothy strain. Such grief,
even in a little woman of an unpopular
race, commanded respect.
THE AUTOPSY.
Three Wounds, Any One of Which
Would Have Caused Instant
Death.
The autopsy, which was conducted by
Dr. Morgan, showed that one more bullet
had entered the body than was at first
supposed. One bullet entered about one
inch from the right eye and emerged at
the bacfc of the neck. Another entered in
the corner of the right eye. These two
wounds met in the brain and, by a re
markable coincidence, both emerged from
the same hole. The unsuspected wound
was through the heart. The bullet bad
entered on the left side, between the third
and fourth ribs. It had passed through
the left lung, the heart and the liver, and
was found imbedded right under the
sKin in tbe small of the back. '
Any -one of the wounds wouid have
caused instantaneous death. This is a re
markable circumstance when the usual
erratic style of highbinder shooting is
considered.
FUNERAL PREPARATIONS.
No Expense Spared In the Prelimi
nary Arrangements.
Immediately upon the completion of
tbe autopsy the body was taken to the
undertaking establishment on Sacramento
street of Nathaniel Gray & Co. Here
preparations were made for a funeral as
bented the financial standing of the de
ceased. A metallic casket covered with
broadcloth, the best the establishment af
forded, was procured. Two apparently
similar caskets were shown the brother.
One was held at $175, the other at $200.
Without inquiring the intrinÂ»ic difference
between the two the brother stated tbe
$200 one was what he wanted.
An order has been placed with a Chi
nese tailor for the finest burial raiment
Chinatown can produce. The crowning
elory of his interment outfit will be a con
sular cap ornamented with a huge gold
knob, one of the kind in which the nobil
ity of China are buried.
The funeral will b* held to-morrow, prob
ably at 1 o'clock. The arrangements for
the ceremonies have not yet been made,
but they will undoubtedly be elaborate.
After the funeral the body will be placed
in a vault, where it will remain until the
widow is ready to return with it to China.
This cannot be much short of a year, as
the widow must remain until the estate is
settled up.
IN CONSTANT DANGER.
Little Pete's Whits Guard Tells of
the Highbinders' Vigilance.
C. H. Hunter has been in constant at

tendance on Little Pete for a month. Pete
also had four Mongolian guards, but one
white man is considered more effective
than a dozen Chinese, as the yellow as
sassins do not do murder in the presence
of white witnesses. Experience lias
taught them that the evidence which
they can always produce in unlimited
quantities does not cut much figure with
white juries when opposed by tne testi
mony of a white man.
'â¢Of late," said Hunter, "I have been
contemplating giving up my job because of
Pete's recklessness and bis often-expressed
contempt of the value of my services.
'There is no more danger of my being
hurt than there is of you,' he would say.
"In spite of this tne fact that a price
was on his head worried him, and of late
be has been rather ill-tempered. Last
night he sent me to get a copy of the
Sporting World and said he w*s going to
get shaved. I told him not to go as it
was dangerous. He cursed me and said
there was no danger. He was killed
while I was away."
Hunier says that men have several
times tried to get the drop on Pete since
he has been in his employ. "Only last
week." he said, "a man rubbed up against
me to see if I lad a weapon. I gave him
a shove and four other men showed hos
tility. I had to hit one on the head with
my revolver before they would desist."
WHY HE BRIBED POLICEMEN
Little Pete's Bold Acknowledgment
to His Attorney and the
Court.
Tbe extraordinary cleverness of- Fong
Ching, the Chinaman who was murdered
Saturday night, was never so well evinced
as upon bis trial on a charge of bribery as
far back as 1888. when he was but a lad of
21 years of age.
In t ose days Little Pete, as he was
better known even among his Chinese ac
quaintances, was a power in that quarter
where tha heathen most congregate. With
power in those days, as at the present
time, there went a certain element' of
danger. Pete, realizing this, imported a
notorious highbinder named Lee Chuck
to act as his bodyguard.
Not satisfied with preventing others
from murdering his master, Chuck went
a-gunning himself one day on Washing
ton street, exactly opposite the place
where Pete was assassinated Saturday.
He killed his man, and after several
years of detention pending numerous
trials he was eventually and satisfactorily
hanged.
Little Pete- stood nobly by his body
guard until the last, bringing to his aid
all hi* cunning and using his sack quite
liberally where it couM do the most uoo<i.
On August 5, 1886, Policeman John B.
Martin, now a sergeant on tbe force, ar
rested Pete, chargiM 1 -' him with attempt
ing to bribe Polic m^n Burr Love and
Con O'Sullivan with $40J to assist in clear
ing Lee Chuck. The offer, it was claimed,
was made in the back room of a saloon at
Clay and Stockton streets.
Attorneys Hall McAllister and Bergin
were for the defense and they were as
tounded at the declaration made to them
by this bit of a Chinese boy.
"Now, I will tell you, gentlemen," said
Pete, '"I'm no lawyer and that's why I re
tain you. But I do know this: I stand
alone agnir.st two policemen who will
swear I offered them $400, therefore 1 will
not be believed. Now, I want to go on
the stand and confess that I not only
offered them the money, but that they
took it."
This extraordinary plea, the most re
markable Attorney McAllister nad ever had
submitted to him, was out of the question
until Little Pete convinced his attorneys
that ha was right. 4
"Gentlemen," he continued, "you are
not as well acquainted with the pol cc de
partment as I ara. They have been black
mailing every Chinaman in Chinatown
for years, and it is not a question of right
or wrong with them; it is 'how much
money do we get?'
"Yes. gentlemen, I paid those officers a
bribe, but it was honestly done, as I asked
them to take tbe money and only testify
to the truth. The truth is all I wanted
of them, and 1 thought" $400 would be
enough for them to tell that, but it was
not. They came back for more money,
and when I refused their demands they
not only convicted my friend but ar
rested me."
Little Pete, whose English was as per
fect as any American's, told the above
story in court before a jury and Judge
Toohy. Tie jury disagreed and upon a
subsequent trial Pete was convicted.
Uron the latter occasion the Judge's
charge w"as a virtual instruction to the
jury that Pete be found guilty, as a China
man's word could not bear the same weight
as that of a white man. Upon the latter
showing the Supreme Court granted Pete
another trial, at which he was acquitted.
In the mean time, however, Pete suffered
eighteen months' incarceration in the
Folsom Penitentiary.
Subsequently Pete wa3 arrested on a
charge of embracery in connection with
this same matter of Lee Chuck, but tie
secured an acquittal.
In those days Chris Buckley, the Demo
cratic boss, was in power. Pa c had
named him the "Blind White Devil."
While searching Little Pete's safe during
his incarceration the police obtained con
siderable evidence showing that Buckley
and Pete were doing business, and one
letter in particular, or, rather, a copy of
it, from Pete to Quang Chic, told the
story of the former's refusal to any longer
submit to Buckley's demands.
That Little Pete was a man of great
business acumen, as well as a heavy-weight
thinker and general schemer, needs no
better i lustration than the flourishing
condition of his estate.
His attorney, Tnomas D. Riordan, who
has been his legal adviser during more
than a decade, tells how bis client was
clever enough to take advantage of all the
benefits to be gained both in this country j
and in China. Here be had but about
$50,000 invested. This amount was suffi
cient for him to carry on bis large shoe
establishment and other enterprises, jn
China, however, Pete had nearly $100,000
invested in artificial fish ponds, the in
dustry there that pays even better than i
the cultivation of tea or rice. In fact, it is
claimed ;hat Litile Pete's profits on his
fishing investment amounted to more
than 7 per oent.
Pete was a great lover of American
methods and particularly of tbe life
insurance plan in vogue here. He fre
quently spoke to his friends, saying that
he wouid deem himself a benefactor of his
race if he established life insurance among
his people. He carried a rather heavy
line of insurance upon his own life, the
beneficiary being his brother, Fong Shun.
Pete had a ereat reverence for his old
mother in China and cared for her in
good style. He also thought very much
of his wife, who lived with him in this
City up to the time of his death.
Contrary 'o the usual custom of white
men who insure for the benefit of their
wives, Pete followed the custom of his
race and his brother was made tbe bene
ficiary. The condition of his estate would
have been different, however, had his eld
est son been of age. This not being the
case the entire estate must revert to the
brother, in trust for the widow and chij.
dren.
HE LEFT NO WILL.
Little Pete's Estate Goes to His
Brother Until His Oldest
Boy Is of Age.
Following the usual custom of the Chi
nese, Little Pete le!t no will.
"Thati3 not strange," stated Attorney
Riordan, when asked about* the matter
yesterday. "As far back as I can remem
ber, Dr. Li Po Tai is ihe only Chinaman
who has ever died here who made a testa
ment accordine to our laws. That was
prooaDly on account of the tremendous
holdings of his estate in these parts.
"The custom of the Chinese is greatly
according to the old English law which
provides that the estate of the deceased
shall go to the eldest child who, if not of
age, cannot enter into its possession until
the proper time. The esiate in such cases
goes to brother or parents of the deceased
in trust."
BREAKING UP THEIR DENS.
The Police Have Started Demolish
ing the Different Strongholds
of the Highbinders.
Sergeant Mooney and posse last evening
opened the battle of the police against the
highbinders and as a result many a fight
ing Mongolian felt a twinge of pain with
out tne pleasure of seeing the red gore
flow or hearing the bark oE the murderous
revolver.
Early in the evening the headquarters
oftheQuong Hon Tong, Brenbam place
and Clay street, was raided by the squad.
Here an exrited crowd of pagans was
gathered discussing the murder of Little
Pete.
The congregation soon scattered, bow
ever, when the police arrived. Those who
lingered in the vicinity were helped along
by the muscular officers, and, thoroughly
chagrined, they sought secluded spots to
meditate and ease their aches. The Bo
On Tong headquarters, Biockton and
Jackson streets, and the Lucy Sing Tong
meeting-room, Juckson and Dupont
streets, were visited in turn and the
gathered celestials were driven and
jammed into the open air, each witn a
warning to select a spot and occupy it
solely and alone or suffer the conse
quences. Chief Crowley has placed Ser
geant Price in charge of the Chinatown
squad in the day time and Sergeant Cook
at night. Price is the Sergeant who so
successfully broke up the highbinder dens
some months ago, and his presence is
hailed as guarantee o! exciting times to
come.
GRAND THEATER TO OPEN.
Now That "Little P<=te" Is Dead the
Play Will Go On.
The Grand Theater, 814 Washington
street, which is owned by the See Yup
Company or members of that fraternity,
will open this evening with due oriental
pomp and ceremony. For months past
I the doors of the house of amusement have
been barred. The boycott between the
I S j e Yod and the Sam Yup companies
caused the closing of this celebrated thea
ter.
An occasional Sam Yup man, thirsty
for pleasure, thinking that he would
escape identification, would slip in and
take a seat. In a moment, however, a
shrewd spy would scent him, and he
would be dragged in disgrace from the
place and fined for his faithlessness.
These disturbances finally resulted in the
closing of t c place, as honest people
were afraid to come â afraid that a shoot
ing jifiray would occur and a stray bullet
end an innocent life.
Last evening, however, a glaring sign
heralding tbe theater's opening was
posted outside its doors. Coming so soon
after the death of "Little Pete" this fact is
tail to have a deep significance; the
effect after a disturbing cause removed.
"Little Pete" was the aggressor among
t> c Sam Yups, and now that he is a
corpse â that his soul has "saluted his
ancestors"â the See Yups feel safe in
adding the clanging of their theater
gongs and the cries of their actors to the
chaos of Chinatown.
DONG GONG IS MARKED.
Rumor Has It That the Interpre
ter's Life Is Wanted.
A rumor Is passing and repassing from
Chinese lip to Cbinese ear that Dong
Oong, confidant, interpreter and police
informer for the Chinese Merchants' Asso
ciation, is on the list marked for assassina
tion. Truly this Chinaman Is as inoffen
sive as he is honest, ami it is probably the
latter virtue that has gained for him th*
enmity of the lawless an d blood-thirsty
Highbinders who seek bis life.
A bae of gold, how large cannot be
learned, it is said, is waiting ready to be
placed in the pocket of him who stains
his bands with the blood of the inter
preter.
D >ng Gong will not admit for publica
tion that his life is sought by his enemies.
His actions, however, are inconsistent
with his denials. He called at the Cali
fornia-stree police station early yesterday
morning and in tones that betrayed bis
fears asKed to be guarded to bis home.
This was granted him and Done Gong
walked to bis residence beside a blue uni
formed policeman. It is said that outside
of Dong's honesty, he is also the victim of
another mislortune, that of being a cousin
of a Suey Sing Tong leader. The Buey
Sin r Tong is partially, if not. w oily re
sponsible for "Little Pete's" Ueatb and
in true accordance wit highbinder custom
the spilled blood of the interpreter would,
it is thought by Chinese, wipe out the
crime of bis relative.
THE SAM YUPS MEET.
It Is Understood i hat They Havp
Decided to Even Up on
the S c Yups.
Hardly had the warmth died out of the
body of the murdered man when the Sam
Ynps held a meeting at the rooms of the
Wan Ting San Fong tong at 820 JacKson
street, the third floor. Scouts were sent
out to bring as many members to the
meeting rooms as posbible, and the place
was crowded.
The conference lasted till daylight, and
resulted in the declaration that som>
prominent member of the See Yups must ,
die in expiation of tbe murder ot Fong
Cbing, or "Little Pete."
Nor is a fear of arrest and punishment
likeiy to cause these highbinders of the
Sam Yup Society to go slow. Their blood
is up, ami revenge is the prominent idea
in their minds.
The regular Chinatown squad was on
duty as usual yesterday. It consists of
rive men. E. C. Robinson, J. P. Myler,
Peier A. Gillin. P. O'Connell and James
Regan, all under the command of ber
geant Mooney.
Besides the regular squad there is a
special detail of nine officers, under ber
geant Wollweoer. Their names are W. D.
Scott, R. Connor, M. Callinr.n, J. B.
O'Connor, P. Butler, James Mc-G â vern,
John Crotfley, P. Walsh and P. J. O Brian.
Late yesterday afternoon Captaiu Lees
ordered six additional officers to be added
to the squad. All of them are kept Lusuy
engaged patrolling the alleys and peeping
inso ibedenaof iniquity, with which, the
Chinese quarter abounds.
Officer Butier was stationed yesterday
before tue door of the barber-shop at 8.17
Washington street, where 'LittJe Pete
.was killed. The shop is closed, bui But
ler was constantly obliged to keep the
crowds of morbidiy curious moving on.
Tbe 6iÂ«ht of tbe blood-stained floor and
chair in the room, which couid De seen by
straining on tit toe, was more than cu
riosity could withstand.
An examination of tiie premises showed
that the assassins narrowly missed killing
two other men at the time they shot at
Pete. One of the bullets passed through
tbe partition into an adjo niug barber
shop at 815}^, and another was found im
bedded in tuc same partition a few incues
from the nole made by the first.
A Chinese well Known in local court cir
cles as merchant and interpreter was in
King Ti's merchandise establishment next
door io the scene oi tbe shooting. He
states that immediately beiore "Little
Pete" entered tue barber shop he told him
that he bad lately made a good business
deal and closed up %'IWO on it, at the same
time exhibiting with aiy winks a handful
of gold coin. . .
'liiis person is inclined to the behei that
the Sue Sing is responsible for "Little
Pete's" death, as Chew Jing, the man
lately murdered by the Wah Ting San
Fong tong, of which Pete was the recog
nized bead, was a member of that hatchet
wielding souety.
It will be remembered also, as reported
exclusively in Ihe Call of a former date,
ih.it it was the Sue Sing highoinder soci
ety which accused the dead Chinese of
putting up tbe job on the police to give
ihe murderers of Jing time to leave t .c
country. The Sue Sing stated tnat "Lit
ile Ptte" had hired certain men, whom on
occasion could be easily proved innocent,
to rest under the suspicion of ttie police
and go to prison until after the affair had
blown over.
The men did so, at least, whether vol
untarily or not, and in due time were re
leased for lack ot evidence. The scheme
worked like a charm.
Officer Robinson desires to correct some
mis>tatements made regarding ihe arrest
of Wong Sing and Chin Poy made in a
morning pÂ» per. He also contributes the
very valuable statement that the revolver
(with four chambers emptied) picked up
by Special Officer George Welch on the
corner of Jackson street and Waverly
place is known to belong to one of tue
men that fled into 123 Waveriy place.
Welch caw one of the men drop it, al
tuough he cannot tell which one did so.
"The public would get a conception
from certain published statements,'' said
Robinson, "that the squad had been de
coyed into raiding tan games to give the
murderers a better chance oi escape. This
is not true.
"Two of the (quad had raided one game,
and my partner, Myler, and I contem
plated raiding another. We were stand
ing at the time at tie corner of JackÃon
street and Fish alley.
"Weil, I leit Myler there and went up
to Ross alley to get an ax. Woile I was
on my way there I saw Chinese running
and toot after them.
"When I came to Wawrly place I met
Welch. He told me two men just ran
into No. 123. We went up there and ar
rested Sing and Poy. Both were taken to
the barber shop where the murder oc
curred and I turned one man over to
Officer Callinan, who had been along with
loaded that if it had been discharged it
us.
I 'As the crowd w-as increasing I went
after Myier and then we both returned to
the shop. You see by this that the squad
was on the scene as quick as anybody.
It is stated by the police that the old
fashioned pocket howitzer picked up by
Robinson on Waverly place was so heavily
would have blown tue man that held it to
atoms.
in the room where the two men were
arrested tbe officers found a chest contain
ing a box of loose cartridges, a three
cornered dagger and two pairs of "solder"
knuckles. The solder used in their manu
facture was douotless purloined at some
cannery, as more of the loose material lay
in the chest

The game was a close one up to the sev

The Santa Claras became rattled in the
jeventh and made some cos:ly errors, al
lowing their opponents to score two runs.
In the next inning our more runs were
added, winning the game.
The defeat of tbe vsito s was due to the
poor support given Steffani. The latter
p tched an exce lent garae, .iving but two
men their bases on balls and striking out
ten men. Foley played ye!iow ball on
third, making six costly errors and vir
tually losing the game.
While .etching too close to the batter in
the filth inning Drews was hit in the heait
by Farry as he swunu around. He was
knocked insensible, but when he retrained
consciousness he pluckily continued the
game. The features of the game were tbe
excellent batting of Spellman and Drews'
running catch of a foul fly. The score is

IN STRICKEN INDIA
Ravages of the Famine and
Plague Described by
Missionaries.
Oae-Third of the Population of
Bombay Fiee for Their
Safety.
Children of Afflicted Natives Rescued
by Christian Workers From
This Country.
BOSTON, Mass., Jan. 24.â The American
board has received a group of letters from
its missionaries and correspondents in
India relating to the plague and famine.
Rev. E. S. Hume of Bombay, who went to
India in 1875, sayc:
"Things have been goinp from bad to
worse until the situation is most grave
and even alarming. One-third of the poo
ulation of the city is said to have fled and
multitudes are still leaving. One of the
railroads has put on six extra trainÃ a day
/and hundreds crowd about the municipal
/ .tious waiting for an opportunity to get
t away. At first the plague was confined to
-. one ward of tue city, but it nas spread
from place to place until no section is free
Irom the disease. So, also, all classes of
Europeans have suffered from it. The
public reports have greatly under-esti
mated the number of deaths, which is not
less than 200 and 300 a day.
"The native Chr.stians have been mar
velously protected. Not one so far as I
know has suffered from the plague. The
Bishop of Bombay has appointed a day
lor special prayer to be observed by all
of the Church of England congregations,
and has invited all other Christians to
jpin with them. This has been done none
too soon. Hindus, Mohammedans and
Parsees have in their own way shown that
they recognize the hand of God in the
affliction and know that deliverance must
come from a higher than human power."
G. S. Eddy, one of the secretaries of the
students' volunteer movement, mingles
an account of the effects of the famine
with a story of the efficiency and demands
of missionary work. The letter is dated
from Calcutta, but refers to previous ex
periences in Bombay. He says:
"Leaving the steamer we step into a boat
and enter Bombay, a town of nearly a
million people. The streets are thronged
with dark-skinned natives, whose differ
ing turbans ana dress indicate their re
ligion and caste. Here we pass a group of
women tearing their breasts to a dirge;
ti.e plague has another victim. From the
busy street we enter the acre of mission
ary compound with its low buildings.
After the finest welcome we ever received
we go to breakfast, just such a one as we
wouid have at home. As we leave break
last we notice a native woman working
quietly in the corner of the halL The few
pennies she is earning keep her from
barving in these times when ncr only
I ud has been cold water. vVe pass a
' Â«roup of swarthy men from the famine
district waiting to ask the missionary for
work. After helping them he crosses the
comooniid to the schoolhouse. About 200
of the brightest faces one ever saw are be
fore him, the boys with bright eyes, the
girls neatly dressed in white.
"While we are singing we are noting
some of the more striking faces. That
dark, wistful child was rescued from un
der blows. Notice those few black faces,
evidently African, among the ligh:er In
dian brown. Those girls were captured
from a siaver. The missionary rescued
them a second time from the Mohamme
dans here, who almost had them in their
clutches. That fair Indian girl, the
beauty of whose character is written on
her face, wa^ brought here one day by her
heart-broken father.
" 'Madam,' he said, 'my wife has just
died and our law requires that I turn my j
little girl of six out from under my own j
roof. A man at forty has offered me 200
rupees for her this morning. I cannot
â  give her to him for it will mean her death.
Our priests are waiting at my door, de
manding my child ior the degrading ser
vice ol the temple. They shall not have
her, for I love her. All of these years I
have watched your school girls pass my
door and I have never seen an unhappy
face. Some one must love them. Oh,
will you love my little piri? It will cost
me caste and everything, but I give her to
you.'
"If you could see the peaceful face of
this little girl and the filthy temDle priests
at the temple waiting for their prey like
vultures at the Parsee burying-ground,
you would never ask again if missions
paid in sustaining girls in this Christian
hoarding-school, rescued from filth and
/ famine and vice for $35 a year.
We next visit a low caste school for
* .vs. Last week the best scholar died.
He had fallen from a tree, and the parents
called their heathen doctor, who said that
a spirit pushed him from the tree and it
must be driven out of him. He is seized
by tne hair and beaten with a stick. From
the fear and pain fever sets in and the
little boy die;. This is civilized Bombay.
In the last lamine, half of the children in
this school ate salt so they could fill up
with water and not require food. One
little boy was discovered wearing a big
knot tied against his stomach 'to tie down
the pain so that he could study."'
Rev. Mr. Barton, D.D., secretary of the
American board, Â«ays that while the pop
ulation of Bombay are leaving it, the
missionaries remain, in order to render
assistance to the stricken people, and, by
their presence, even to restore confidence
and impart knowledge to those who can
not get away. The plague has reached
very near to their premises.

LONDON, Ejtg., Jan. 24. â In the House of Common* Lord George Hamilton, Secretary of State for India, stated that Lord Sandhurst, Governor-General of Bom
bay, had informed the India Office by telegraph that alarmist telegrams, greatly exaggerating the plague situation as regards the spread of the contagion to Europeans,
were being sent from Bombay to Europe by press representatives and others. Thus far, Lord Sandhurst wired, only four Europeans Had died from the plague, in
cluding a physician and a nurse.
any attempts to interfere with their sui- <
cidal way of living.
Having once gained a foothold in such a
quarter and among such people nothing
but tbe most drast c measures can ever j
stamp out any epidemic, let alone such a
terrible scourge as the present visitation.
The city of Bombay, or rather the aggre
gation of densely populated districts which
are called by that name, is situated near
the lower part of. an island of the same
name, which is one of an archipelago of
seven islands near the mouth of the Ulas
River, on tbe west coast of India. Bom
bay Island is about tweive miles long and
in the vi.per part three wide, with a long
peninsula (Kaiaba) narrowing off to the
south on the land side, and a shorter one,
Malabar Point, on *he sea side. A range
of hills extendÃ from the latter up the
west side as far as Mahim, and another on
the east side from Mazagon up an equal
distance. The long peninsula is a sort of
low plain, with an eminence of thirty to
fifty feet at tbe southern extremity.
On the upper part of this peninsula is
the original European town founded by
the Portuguese. This is the commercial
and administrative quarter and goes by
the name of "The Fort." Below it is the
town of Kaiaba and various hospitals and
Suniia ruins, observatory, barracks, etc.
North and west of "The Fort" comes
the esplanade, which foimerly was en
tirely open, but of later years has been
devoted to railroad and other industrial
and business purposes. On tbe east side
from the Government dockyard, on up to
Mazagon, is the port of Bombay, witn its
large basins, spacious docks and vast
warehouses, said to be as extensive as any
in the world. In "Tbe Fort," along this
quarter of the city, the business of the
Kurop-ans mainly lies. As is the custom
in the Far East, the hours of business are
short â from 10 A. if. to 3 P. M. â at which
hour tbe offices and stores are deserted
! and the place is quiet and, as it were,
! dead till the next day. The Portuguese
and ihe wealthy Parsees repair to Maza
gon Heights, while the other Europeans
betake themselves to Malabar Hill,
Khumbala Bluff and Mahim, while many
cross over ihe hills about Tannah on Sal
i cette Island, or on by rail to the moun
tains of Abunatu, Matheran and Panwel,
on the road to Madras, where at an
altitude of over 2000 feet more comfort can
be had than on the island.
The impetus given to the trade of Bom
bay in cotton during the American war.
the completion of the Suez canal and tbe
grand trunk lines of railroad to Calcutta
and Madras, with branches to other parts
of the great empire, has more than
doubled the business and the population
of the city during the last forty years, the
latter now being estimated at about
900,000. Seventy per cent of these are
Hindoos. The Europeans number about
13,000, and the rest of the population is
made up of every nationality and race
under the sun, Parsees, Arabs, Chinese
and Malays being the moat numerous.
From the first the other races left "Tbe
Fort" to the Europeans and settled them
selves in the part of the island just to the
north and between Mazagon and Malabar
hillsâ each nationality a race together.
The rapid influx of people caused more
indifference than usual in tbe location of
these habitations, and streets were not
laid off, but just extended themselves,
haphazard, as it were, in the direction of
travel. Soon all the higher parts of tbe
plain were taken up with dwellings and
huts, and when the railroads were built,
with their great causeways over to
Salcette and the mainland, much land
was reclaimed and used to raise them
above the tide water. Over this tha town

was rapidly extended. The streets, or
rather roads, being kept nearly to a level,
the houses were left some feet below, and
in many instances whole districts were cut
off from proper drainage â sufficient cause
to breed disease and epidemic at any time.
The first outbreak in Bombay in this in
stance is said to have been In the quarter
called Umarkliadi, south of Mazagon and
just west of the Prince's does. Thence it
spread to Bycullah on the north, Bhu
lesvar on the west and so on over "Black
town."
Bycullah, the district in which the
plague now rages with the greatest viru
lence, is situated on a low, marshy plain
of great extent, formerly covered by the
sea. It is about the most unhealthy quar
ter of the many to be found in black
Bombay. The inhabitants are chiefly the
poorer classes of Parsees and half-castes
and some minor European employes, who
have set up native establishments. In
this quarter is the notorious Duncan road,
the "blood town" of Bombay, a sort of
Alsatia. It is a place of resort and refuge
for every person of bad repute on the
whole island â in fact, of all the west coast.
Numerous thieves, deserting sailors,
beach-combers of every nationality and
other abandoned characters, throng the
low taverns and grogshops and swarm in
the pestilent hovels.
Adjoining Bycullah on the northeast is
another large and populous city, Maza
gon, but of a different character, though
also a very unhealthy place, except on the
summits and slopes of the hills. The soil
about Mazagon is very fertile and the
vegetation very rank, from which poison
ous exhalations constantly arise. Maza
gon is largely inhabited by descendant of
the old Portuguese colonistsâ a very much
mixed and degenerated race, who have
entirely adopted the Indian mode of
living. .
CORBET T TALKS AGAIN.
TÂ»ll8 of His Training and Says He Would
Like to Have the Battie in the
Sagebrush State.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 24.â James J. Cor
bett arrived here to-day from St. Louis.
He will commence actual training in
about two weeks. His theatrical com
pany will play in Chicago this week and
next week in Kansas City, and then his
trainer will take him to t h- battle-ground.
Corbett is not accompanied by his wife.
"I am keeping in training," said Cor
bett; "work hard for an hour and a half
or two hoars every day. I do my train
ing with McVey, although I find some
body in every town to meet me in a few
rounds of sparring. Handball is the best
kind of exercise for me and I can say with
out boasting that I play a great game. I
have met all the best players in the
United States and Canada, and the man
who wins from me has some trouble."
Asfced about the location of the ap
proaching fight with Fitzsimmons, the
cbampion said:
"You know as much about that subject
as I do. It will be a weight off my mind
when I learn the truth. I should like to
have it in Nevada, out toward my old
home, but as Dan Stuart ie spending so
much time in the South, I suppose the
battle will be down there. I shall have
more work to get acclimated if the South
is the place.
"Fitzsimmons is talking a good deal
and with very poor excuse. It would be
much more graceiui if hÂ« would put up
his money first. I have $7500 and he but
$2500. Of course Ido not doubt but that
he will make the rest of tbe forfeit, but he
is ratÂ»ier slow, to say the least."
After another mierview the question
was put as to Corbett's plans after tbe
fight:
"I shall go on the road attain at once,"
he said. "I don't know whether 1 shall
ever fight again or not."
VON HAHNKE NOW
HAS THE SWING
It Means a Naw Turn in
the Policies of the
Kaiser.
Lteps to Be Taken Toward the
Repression of All Liberal
Ideas.
Gig Laws to Bl Put in Operation
Worse Th ;n Those in Vogue Dur
ing the Bismarck Regime.
[Copyright, 1807, by the United Associated PressesJ
BERLIN, Germany, Jan. 24.â The Em
peror's allusion to a recent report of the
existence of a court cabal, and his state
ment that he knew nothing of any such
clique as has been alleged to exist, do not
alter the fact that besides his Majesty's
public ministerial council, he has his all
potent private advisers.
The influence of yon Hahnke appears
now in the ascendant with the Kaiser,
who has on several occasions dined his
charge of military cabinet alone, a dis
tinguished mark of imperial favor and
confidence. General yon Hahnke's as
cendency implies much. It means
the active prosecution of the plans for
increased armaments and in the sphere of
internal politics, lor Hahnke is no mere
professional soldier. It means a return
to a policy of repression of liberal ideas
and especially of Socialism. It means
that the Kaiser has for some time past
regretted the line he took in 1889,
in endeavoring to reconcile the
workingmen. He finds that they will not
be placated on any terras but their own,
and that his endeavors at conciliation
have been taken as a proof of weakness
on his part.
In going back to a policy of restriction,
of which the Umsturz bill in the Reichstag
was an instance, the Kaiser will have- the
heartiest support from the Hahnke circle.
There is good reason for expecting a Gov
ernment measure in thd Landtag propos
ing such amendments to the existing
common laws as will supply the Prussian
authorities with ample means to counter
act thestil! growing Socialist propaganda.
The law touching political organiza
tions, rights of meeting and press criti
cisms of public or private events is to be
"amended" and the severest repression
resorted to, as in the worst period ol the
Bismarck regime.
The composition of the Landtag renders
these proposals mure likely of acceptance
by the Landtag than was accorded by tfie
Reichstag to the Umsturz bill. Apropos
of the spread of Socialism, a Socialist re
view, Die Neve Zeit of Stuttgart, pub
lishes a statistical table on the influence
exercised by religion on the development
of Socialism. The figures as given show
that in every case where Catholicism is
dominant Socialism has the smallest rela
tive number of adherents. In Hamburg,
for instance, wnere the numerical ma
jority is Protestant, the Socialists hold
59.3 percent of the suffrage. In districts,
as in Hesse, where the Catholics form an
important majority, the Socialist vote de
scends to 24 per cent, and in districts such
as Posen, a Catholic province, there are
only 2 p?r cent of Socialist votes.
Centerist papers draw the inference that
the Catholic religion affords a resisting
force 10 the growth of anarchism and
argue that the Government in combating
socialism ought to recognize ita best ally
in the party of the Center.

cently became the husband* of Miss
Lucy Uhl. The ladies of the Embassa
dor's party wore court dresses of unusual
splendor. Mrs. Squires was attired in a
white satin gown embroidered with silver
arabasques. tier corsage was embroidered
with gold flowers, each glittering with
diamond dewdrops.
The movement for a common German
national fete day, which was started in
1893 by some wel'-meaning folks and con
siderably discussed at the time, but with
out practical issue, has been revived. An
executive committee has come to the front
with a proposal that the first celebration
be tiled for 1900, that being the earliest
year when the gigantic arrangements con
templated can be carried out. There are
opponents to any national fete of this
kind, who say that 1900 will find particu
larism in Germany stronger than in 1897.
The economic differences between north
and south, west and northeast, the old
jealousies between Sudbraus, Bavarians
and Prussians, continue wide and deep.
The Kaiser is understood to have con
sulted Minister Miquel on the question of
the Turkish finance?, and especially in
the light of the recent report of Sir Edgar
Vincent, president of the Imperial Otto
man Bunk. The result has confirmed the
Kaiser in his determination :o support the
Sultan in his project of a council of
finance composed of Turks and Europeans
appointed by the Sultan himself and not,
as suggested by Lord Salisbury, under Eu
ropean control.
The conclusion of the Vincent report
that, Turkey will soon be financially sound
and prosperous under even moderately
good administration is now the official
German conclusion. The Kaiser appears
still to rely on the tjultan as being de
sirous to obtain an honest and effective
administration. Immediate developments
in the East will tend to disprove the gen
erally accepted notion that German in
terest in and influence upon Turkish
matters are only of a minor character.
Upon all this all-important and initial
question of financial reforms the Sultan,
with the support of Germany, will have
his way. German policy, adroitly passive
regarding Armenia, has been equally
adrou on the leading question before the
em bassiidoriaJ conferences. One result of
this agreement between the Kaiser and
the Sultan will be seen in increased con
cessions to German subjects, who now
hold the concessions for the leading Ana
tolian railways, supply the officials that
work them and get the principal contracts
for arms und ammunitions.
The Under Secretary to the Turkish
Finance Ministry, Bertran Effendi, who
recently resigned rather than countenance
the bogus budget, is likely to withdraw
his resignation. Bertran was sent from
the Berlin treasury nearly sixteen years
ago to reorganize the Turkish customs.
Nominally he is still a Prussian official,
holding the rank of sturerrath (Councilor
of the taxes), and he has been told to re
main at Constantinople.
PLENTY OF TIMBER
FOR THE CABINET
Every Available Man in the
Country Suggested for
a Place.
Nearly All the Portfolios Have
Been Tendered, But There
May Be a Readjustment
Cold Comfort Gven a Nebraskaa Who
Urged the Claims of His Own
State.
CANTON, Ohio, Jan. 24â There is a
growing impression that the Cabinet will
be finally completed within three weeks,
with the possible exception of one place.
Though Major MeKinley may decide
within the next ten days upon the eight
men who are to form his official family, it
does not follow that tne tinai appointment
of places and portfolios will be made
within that time. Most of the men who
are selected for the Cabinet will doubt
less be shifted about from time to time
and the final complexion of the Cabinet
may not be arranged before March 1. The
Secretary of State is, of course, decided on
and the Secretary of the Treasury will be
as definitely known as will that of tiie In
terior Department, but the portfolios of
war, of the navy, of agriculture, of justice
and the Postoflice Department will be a
good deal shifted about. The President
elect desires to fill the more important
places in his Cabinet as soon as possible,
in order that some thought may be given
as to the wort of choosing assistant secre
taries and the organization of the depart
ments.
A good deal of progress in the work of
Cabinet-making will probably be made
this week. Major McKinley has prac
tically finished the sifting process, and
he has listened to as many suggestions on
one hand and protests on tne other as he
has time for. The whole situation has
been thoroughly canvassed, every avail
able man in the country has been sug
gested for appointment to the Cabinet
and a legion of almost unknown quantities
have caused the President-elect to be
convinced that if he so desired he would
be told where he might discover some
hitherto unexpected timber for his Cab
inet.
The New York problem of Cabinet rep
resentation will probably be solved this
week. The current gossip is that General
Stewart L. Woodford will be the New
York member of the Cabinet. He is
highly esteemed by the President, and
personally is on most agreeable terms
with him.
Major McKinley is more intimately ac
quainted with General Wood ford than
with any of the other New York men who
are talked of as Cabinet possibilities. The
President-elect has a high opinion of
Wood ford's ability, and if political condi
tions continue to be as favorable as they
now seem to be, he is pretty certain to be
the next Secretary of War or tne Navy.
General Alger's appointment to the
Cabinet is not regarded as certain, but the
belief that he will be in it grows, and this
notion Is strengthened by the knowledge
that ex-Governor Merriam of Minnesota
and Henry C. Payne of Wisconsin seem
almost to have dropped, for the time at
least, from the Jist of those who are bains
seriously considered. There will be in all
probability a Cabinet officer from Wiscon
sin, Michigan or Minnesota, and if Mr.
Payne or Mr. Merriam is not chosen it is al
most certain General Alzer will be, unless
Lyman J. Gago should be made Secretary
of the Treasur ', in which event his ap
pointment would be deemed sufficient
recognition for all that general section of
the country.

by the visit of a Chicago gentleman to
Canton, it may be safely assumed that his
appointment is being more seriously con
sidered than ever, though it is by no means
certain that he will be selected, and indeed
the impression still prevails here that
Charles Emory Smith of Philadelphia is
the strongest possibility.
Information received here to-d3y and
during the last ten days make it certain
that the Senate of the United States will
be favorable to the enactment of protec
tive tariff legislation.
Major McKinley is more interested in
restoring confidence and prosperity than
the mere filling of offices and a good deal
of his time which the public thinks is oc
cupied with questions relating to pat

and discussions bearing on policies.

LINCOLN, Nebr., Jan. 24.â Peter Jan
sen, one of the delegates-at-laree from Ne
braska to the Republican National Con
vention, is in the city direct from a visit to
Major McKiniey. He tells of an extended
interview with the President-elect on
Cabinet possibilities, and says:
"The conversation turned on the matter
of Secretary of Agriculture. I impressed
on him that the agricultural interests of
the country wanted a man from tne Mid
dle West, not from ttie Far West, as Cali
fornia, for a man from there would not
â  understand the problems that confront the
farmers of the great plains region. Major
McKiniey replied that he was satisfied a
man from the corn belt was needed. The
major then turned and said : 'Do you
know Senator Wilson of Iowa?
"I replied that I did and that he was a
fine man. 'But we have some good timber
in Nebraska, I interposed, anxious to
stand up for the State. 'That is so; I
lully realize it,' said the major. Then
after a pause he said significantly, 'It is
really too bad that Nebraska went back
on us. The State should have pone Re
publican.' I took this to mean that Ne
braska could not expect to get a Cabinet
position under the circumstances, and I
believe Senator Wilson will be Secretary
of Agriculture. As for the Treasury, I
believe either Lyman J. Gage of Chicago
or Senator Cullom will be the choice."
Mr. Jansen says Major McKinley is
strongly in favor of international bimet
allism. â â 
FALL OF A TOPMAST.
It Killed the Captain's Son and Cause
the Sorrowful Mate to Attempt
Suicide.
TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Jan. 24.â The
schooner Norman, Captain E. B. Gray,' of
Castine, Me., from Barbacioes, West Indies,
arrived at Carrabelle yesterday. When off
Santo Domingo January 11 the mate, J. J.
Leighton, W'th two men, was aloft on the
mizzenmast to repair some damage that
had been done to the topmast, and from
some cause unexplained the lashings hold
ing it broke, letting it fall to the deck.
The captain's son, Walter, a youth about
18 years of age, was standing on the poop
deck, and was struck and instantly killed
by the falling spar. He was buried at sea
January 12. The mate, Leighton, was so
overcome by the accident that he at
tempted to commit suicide by shooting
himself with a revolver, but was prevented
by one of the crew throwing a marlin
spike at him, striking him on the head,
causing the bullet to glance off and in
flicting only a painiul flesh wound on the
head. He was put in irons, and was
handed to Deputy Sheriff Mattair, who
took him to Apalacbota before the Com
missioner, who, finding him rational, and
as he was in no way to blame for the acci
dent in which young Gray was killed, dis
charged him from custody.
Imitating Hryan'* Book.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 24.â Judge Horton
yesterday granted an injunction against
a Philadelphia publishing house to pre
vent imitation of "W. J. Bryan's new book.
Of late another Bryan book has appeared.
While the title page does not say it was
written by Mr. Bryan, the display of
words in large and small type is such, it
is said, as to convey that impression. The
title is "The Great Battle". The injunc
tion was served last night. Attorney
Newman taid that similar injunctions
would be asked for in every city where aa
attempt is made to sell the book.

SPENT A FORTUNE
IN OCEAN TRAVEL
Death of an Old Lady Who
Was Infatuated With
Salt Water.
Had Crossed the Atlantic Two
Hundred and Fifty Times
in Thirty Years.
Never Missed a Trip on the Locania
and Was Known by the Astors
and Vanderbilts.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 24.â Elijah Car
son, a most remarkable woman, died Fri
day night at Alamosa, lowa.
Mrs. Carson had crossed the ocean 250
times and possessed the extroardinary
record of never having missed a trip on
the Lucania since that splendid vessel was
launched.
For thirty years she has been traveling
across the Atlantic until her face has be
come a familiar one, not only to the of
ficers of the vessels of the Cunard line, but
to the custom-house officials on both sides
of the Atlantic. She is said to have been
received on intimate terms by the Astors
and Vanderbilts and other prominent
families of the country who had long been
accustomed to meeting heron her trips
across the sea, and Patti, the prima
donna, had the strongest liking for Mrs.
Carson.
Mrs. Carson was the wife of Samuel
Carson of Belfast. Her name was Newell
before her marriage, and her brother,
William B. Newell, was a millionaire of
Nashville, Term. Shortly after the death
of her husband, in 1864, Mrs. Carson, ac
companied by her daughter Elizabeth,
came to America to visit her brother.
This was Mrs. Carson's first ocean trip
and was the beginning of her infatuation
for the Bea. Mr. Newell prevailed upon
her to remain in America and on his
death bequeathed to her half a million
dollars in cash and property. This formed
an ample fund to permit the indulgence
of her eccentric desire to be continually
on the water.
It was in the year 1566 that Mrs. Carson
was first at liberty to follow her penchant.
She left her young daughter in the hands
of friends and took her second trip to
Belfast. She returned in a few weeks,
saw her child was in safe hands, and from
that time until the day she was seized
with her last illness a month seldom
passed but she took a voyage across the
Atlantic.
In the year 1883 her daughter was mar
ried to Julius Rohrbach, a traveling van
of Chicago. Mrs. Carson then felt that
she had no more family ties which would
restrain her from keeping continually on
the sea, ant] since 1886 her entire time has
been spent in her voyages.
Mrs. Carson had the strongest affection
for Captain McKay and all the officers of
the Lucania and remembered them in her
will. It is said Captain McKay was be
queathed $50,000, and the subalterns sums
proportionate to the esteem in which she
held them. The exact terms of the will,
however, cannot be learned, as the docu
ment was filed at Belfast.
Mrs. Carson was well known in Chicago.
About two years ago her son-in-law, Ju
lius Rohrbach, by the advice of his wife,
made an effort to restrain Mrs. Carson
from taking any more trips across the
ocean. While she was stopping at the ho
tel here on a visit to her daughter, Mr.
Rohrbach went before a local court and
asked for the appointment of a guardian,
making the statement that Mrs. Carson
had already spent $250,000 in her sea voy
ages, and that unless a stop was put on it
her entire fortune would be spent.
Mrs. Carson violently fought this legal
move. In her vigorous manner she an
nounced that she would submit to no re
straint, and that if her son-in-law dared to
interfere with Ler liberty she would cut
him off without a cent. This so alarmed
Mr. Kohrbach and his wife that the pro
ceedings were dropped, and Mrs. Carson
was permitted to resume her journey
ings.
The incident, however, had made an
impression on her mind, for on her next
visit to Belfast she made and had placed
on record a will, in which she gave but
$1000 to her daughter, $25,000 each to her
bankers at Belfast and her agent in New
York City, and the remainder of her for
tune to the officers and crew of the Lu
cania.
Mrs. Carson made her last voyage across
the Atlantic five weeks ago. On the trip
out from Liverpool she was seized with an
attack of pneumonia, and when the
steamer reached New York she was fail
ing rapidly. She was taken to a hotel,
where she remained two days, when her
daughter, Mrs. Rohrbach of Alamosa,
lowa, arrived and took her West.
Mr. and Mrs. Rohrbach arrived this
evening from lowa with Mrs. Carson's
body. They were on their way to Nash
ville, Term., where the interment will take
place. Mrs. Carson was 74 years old.

venience was caused to pedestrians. Prom
all over the city to-night came police re
ports of persons who had fallen on slip
pery sidewalks and been injured more or
less severely.
PITTSBtJRG, Pa., Jan. 24.â The bliz
zard reached this city last night and with
it came the heaviest fall of snow of the
winter, more than six inches covering the
ground to-day. The thermometer was 6
degrees above zero at 6 o'clock and fall
ing.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 24.â N0-night's
reports from every part of the Northwest
indicate that last night was the coldest in
two winters. St. Paul, about the warmest
point in this whole section, registered
25 below. The range was from that figure
to 30 below at St. Cloud, 36 below at Aitkin
and 40 below at St. Hilaire. There are no
reports in yet of people freezing to death,
though suffering in the country must have
been very great. The St. Paul Relief
Society has been busy all day furnishing
coal and other supplies to the needy.
Indications point to a further drop in
the temperature of at least ten degrees to
night.
Eaiiway traffic is everywhere greatly j
retarded, either by drifts or inability to
keep up steam. Around Aberdeen,
Huron, Milbank and Wilmot, S. Dak., no
effort has beea made for two days past to
clear the tracks, owing to the very high
winds, and the cutÃ are now full to the
brim.
A Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul
passenger train is stuck in a drift near
Bonilla, S. Dak. Fuel has been carried to
the train to keep the passengers comfort
able. Another train containing $250,000
of the money of South Dasota ii stuck in
a drift near Highmore, S. Dak. Reports
from points along the Missouri River in
dicate that there will be heavy mortality
among cattle and sheep in that section.
It is clear in Central and Eastern Minne
sota and the wind has subsided.
OMAHA, Nebr., Jan. 24.â This has been
the coldest day Nebraska has experienced
in two years. At many points the mer
cury registered 12 degrees below zero, and
the warmest reported was 4 degrees below.
A strong wind from the north made the
cold seem more interne. The Missouri
River is frozen over, and icemen, who had
given up hope of a crop, will begin cutting
to-morrow. Little snow has fallen in this
section, and railway traffic is not inter
fered with.
DENVER, Colo., Jan. 24. â The cold
wave struck this section at 5 o'clock yes
terday afternoon, and in less than an hour
the thermometer fell 30 degrees from 60
to 20 above zero. Ten above is the mark
registered at 8 o'clock to-night, with pros
pects of zero weather before morning.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan. 24.â The
thermometer at 8 p. M. registered 4
above zero, and before midnight the mer
cury had dropped to as many degrees be
low, with a continual downward tendency.
The reports show that before morning it
will reach 10 or 15 below. The streets
are deserted to-night; the churches are
empty, and numerous entertainments an
nounced in various balls and theaters had
to be abandoned. The suffering among
the poor is appalling.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Jan. 24.â The

still falling.
BUZZ A III) IX Â£AGI4.VC.
Sheep and Cattle IHe on T,and and Fi*h
arm en Perish at Sea.
LONDON, Ekg., Jan. 24.â The snow
storm which began on Friday continues,
and Is causing any amount of interrup
tion of travel and inconveniences. Many
sheep and other animals have perished,
and the losses sustained by farmers and
others will be quite heavy. The snow is
so deep between Hastings and Brighton
that a number of trains have been blocked,
an occurrence which is seldom heard of in
that part of the country.
The severe wind which accompanied the
storm has done considerable damage along
the coast. Some of the fishing boats which
have arrived at Lowestoft report the loss
by drowning of several of their crews. A
number of the boats â were quite badly
damaeed in the buffeting tney received
while trying to make port.
Quantities of wreckage are being washed
ashore on the Norfolk coast, indicating
the loss of some vessels at sea.
SPLIT AMONG THE STRIKERS.
Some of the Union Miners at Leadville
Conclude to Cut Loose From
Their Leaders.
DENVER, Colo., Jan. 24.â The report
was spread about the State to-night that
the Leadville strike had been settled. No
report has ever caused such good feeling
and general rejoicing among the people of
the whole State. At the theaters, when
the curtains fell on the first act=, it was
annoanced from the stages that the strike
was settled. Audiences rose in their seats
and cheered most wildly. In the largest
and most fashionable theater in Denver,
which held about 2000 people, the cheering
continued until the curtain rose on the
second act.
It was not until midnight that the ex
act situation could be learned. It ap
pears that there has been a bolt of a part
of the union members and these have re
solved to cut loose from the dictation of
the leaders and seek work in the mines.
While this has not settled the strike it is
hoped that it may soon reach that end.
The most extrnvagant claims of the bolt
ers still leave a good majority in the
union.
Eugene V. Debs has urged the men to
accept a proposition from the mine-owners
which guarantees the re-employment of
the strikers.
It is believed that if the miners would
get away from the influence of their of
ficers and men from outside the camp they
would soon declare the strike off.

DALLAS, Tex., Jan. 24.â A suit has
been filed by George M. Alvord against
his son-in-law, Dr. M. M. Edmundson, for
$20,000 damages. General Alvord alleges

Dr. Edmunson slandered him to Mrs.
Alvord, destroying her confidence in him,
causing a separation. General Alvord
also caused Dr. Edniundson to be arrested
on a charge of criminal libel. General
and Mrs. Alvord are very old and the
family has been prominent in social and
business circles of Texas for many years.
Dr. Edmundson i.-i a native of Chicago.
His wife was a leader of Dallas society at
the time of her marriage. A son of Gen

Suffering in Aeto York.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 24.â A special to a
morning paper from New York says:
There is famine and suffering in New
York. Tens of thousands of men are out
of worfe and thousands of them doubtless
are suffering the pangs of hunger. Sev
eral cases are reported daily in the local
press, but no attempt has been made by
the newspapers or by any organized
charity to secure statistics, and no one
knows even approximately the extent of
the penniless unfortunate brigade. It is
impossible to make any comparison with
the conditions in Chicago.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 25, 1897.
IMPORTANT WORK
BEFORE CONGRESS
Coming Week Expected to
Be a Lively One in
the Senate.
Arbitration Treaty, Nicaraguan
Bill [and Cameron Resolution
Set for Discussion.
Turpie Will Speak on the Independ
ence of Congress and Arrogance
of the Administration.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 24.â The
arbitration treaty, the Nicaragua canal
and the insurrection in Cuba will be
again discussed in the Senate during the
coming week. Senator Turpie of Indiana
will open the Cuban debate to-morrow,
ostensibly on Senator Cameron's resolu
tion recognizing the independence of the
Cuban republic. Mr. Turpie will devote a
considerable portion of his time, how
ever, as has been said, to a consideration
of the subject of the independence of Con
gress, with sncn incidental strictures on
the manifesto of Secretary Olney as may
occur to a plain, outspoken man who be
lieves the executive department has over
stepped its proper function in seeking to
intimidate the Senate by the threat of the
veto power and the predicted defiance of
contemplated legislation. Mr. Turpie's
penchant for sarcastic comments and his
failure to conform to the polite language
of diplomacy in attacking policies that he
believes to be wrong lead to the belief
that hit speech may be piquant readiug.
The condition of the Nicaragua canal
bill is peculiar. It is still the unfinished
business. Senator Morgan, who has given
the subject careful consideration, says the
bill is drawn so as to come within the
terms of the concession granted by Nica
ragua, and he denies that the letter of
Minister Rodriguez has any weight what
ever. He will antagonize a motion to send
the bill back to the committee if any is
made and insist upon the vote on the bill
being taken. The debate in the Senate
will probably be protracted until the Nica
raguan correspondence called for by Mr.
Morgan's resolution, adopted Saturday, is
received. Meanwhile the Rodriguez let
ter will liaye an important bearing upon
the general treaty of arbitration which
will be taken up by the committee in
special session to-morrow. Friends of the
Isthmus canal will antagonize final action
on the treaty until something definite is
done on the canal bilJ.
At the conclusion of Mr. Turpie's
speech to-morrow, the Senate will listen
to eulogies on the late ex-Speaker Crisp.
The bankruptcy bill, which was on the
special order for 2 o'clock, will in all prob
ability be postponed a few days.
The bill to provide for the representa
tion of the United States by Commission
ers at any international monetary confer
ence hereafter to be calledâ the Wolcott
biil â will be considered Tuesday after the
morning business.
Less than six weeks of the present ses
sion of Congress remain, and this fact has
impressed upon the managers of the
House the necessity of more vigorously
pushing the appropriation bills yet re
maining to be considered.
It was stated yesteiday by a member of
the Committee on Rules that the agricul
ture and Indian bills now on the calendar
would be the principal business on the
programme this week. These bills,
although carrying comparatively small
sums, usually give rise to more debates
than others on the list.
The seed distribution provided for In
the agricultural bill is sure to evoke criti
cisms, and the Indian question can be re
lied upon to occupy a day or more of the
time of the House. The Indian bill fur
ther contains the provisions of the bill
reported two or three weeks ago, to abol
ish the officers of Indian Commissioner
and Assistant Indian Commissioner and
confer their duties on a beard of commis
sioners. This may be promptly disposed
of on a point of order, but is more likely
to be the occasion of considerable talk be
fore being thus disposed of.
The new immigration bill agreed upon
by the conferees will be presented to the
House to-morrow, and the advocates of
the measure will endeavor to secure a day
later in the week for its consideration.
RIVER AND HARBOR JUNKET.
Fourteen Members of the House Commit
tee Start Out to Inspect Work on
Southern Waterways.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 24.âFour
teen of the sixteen members of Congress
composing the Senate Committee on Riv
ers and Harbors, many of them accompa
nied by their wives and other members of
their families, left Washington this morn
ing at 11:15 o'clock over the Southern
Railway for New Orleans and Mobile and
other placet to inspect Government im
provements on waterways.
The party traveled in a special car In
charge of Captain J. W. Bryant, repre
senting the commercial and shipping in
terests of New Orleans. They will reach
Mobile to-morrow, sDend two or three
hours examining the harbors of that city,
reach New Orleans Tuesday evening, and
on Wednesday go down to the mouth of
the Mississippi to see the crevasse in
Pass Aloutre and the jetties and south
west crevasse. They will return to New
Orleans Thursday and leave that night for
Sabine Pass to see the Government works
there, thence to Houston to inspect the
improvements on Buffalo Bayou. After a
visit to Galveston the party will return to
Washington, stopping en route at New
Orleans and Chattanoogo, Term. At the
latter place they will examine the Gov
ernment worts on the Tennessee River.
The trip will consume ten days. Amoni;
those composing the party are Hon. B.
Hermann of Oregon, wife, daughter and
son.
SENATOR G&OKGK VERY ILL.
Relative* Summoned and the Doctors
Thinie He Cannot Recover.
WASHINGTON, D. C.. Jan. 24.âSena
tor J. Z. George of Mississippi is lying ill
to-night at the Garfield Hospital in this
city. At 11 o'clock to-night he is reported
as resting slightly easier than he had been
during the day. His wife and family, who
are at their home at Carrollton, Miss.,
have been summoned to his bedside and
are expected to arrive to-morrow.
Senator George came to this cily from
Mississippi on January 5 last, and imme
niately entered the Garfield Hospital. He
was then suffering from a complication ol
diseases, bronchial catarrh causing him
much annoyance. During the last week
bis hchrt has become involved in the gen
eral complications and it is from this
source that the greatest fears are now en
tertained. A consultation between doc
tors was held yesterday and the gravest
fears of his recovery were expressed. Sen
ator George has been unwell for nearly a j
year and has not occupied his seat in tne
Senate this session.
He is over 70 years of age, and this fact
militates against his recuperation.
STOLE lEX THOVSAXIK
Forged Contracts Cashed by the Con
fidential Cleric of the Contractor.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Jan. 24.â Forged
acknowledged contracts of city woric on
which $18,500 was raised, have been dis
covered. The paper was held by the
Columbia National Bank and the Mercan
tile Trust Company, but neither institu
tion will lose anything for the reason that
the amount involved has been made good
by the contractor, W. J. Dunn.
Mr. Dunn places the blame on a con
fidential clerk, who, he says, is now in the
West, but would not give his name. The
man has wealthy relatives who will
probably make good the money taken by
him. The torged assignments were placed
in tho banks as collateral, and were dis
covered when they were presented to the
County Comptroller for payment. The
actual amount of money appropriated by
the clerk was $10,000.
LOS ANGELES CHURCH WAR.
Colored Brethren Fight in a House of
Worship, end One Gets
Into Court.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 24.â The
brethren (colored) of the Second Baptist
Church of this city have been involved in
strife for several months, with good pros
pects of disrupting the organization. Sev
eral fistic encounters among the deacons
and other leading members of the congre
gation hare taken place during the past
few months. In one of these a Bible was
made to do yeoman service in the hands
of an enraged brother, who floored his an
tagonist with the good book. Great care
has been taken to keep these things from
the general public, but in the trial of Sam
uel Sims on a charge of disturbing the
peace before Justice Morrison yesterday
afternoon ail of the unpleasant facts came
to the surtace.
It appeared from the testimony that the
defendant, Sims, was at the time of the
disturbance endeavoriug to further the
candidacy of Brother Bowman lor the
place of deacon.
Brother Joseph Whitlock, an elderly
man, was the leader of the opposition,
and in the course of the meeting arose to
read a passage from the book of Timothy
.relative to the qualifications of deacons.
Before he had got well started. Brother
Sims appealed to the moderator to de
clare Whitlock out of order unless he
would read the entire chapter instead of
such passages as he might choose to bol
ster his side up.
A personal encounter ensued and
Brother Whitlock was badly worsted.
The church members took sides, some
with Whitlock and some with Sims. One
witness said that Brother Sims, on the
night in question, acted very "gentlefied,"
and she considered his arrest entirely due
to prejudice. Whether Justice Morrison
will take this view remains to be seen.
He took the case under advisement until
to-morrow.
ONTARIO EXPERIMENT BIA.TIOX.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 24.â Ar
rangements are being made at Chaffey

tion, will commence active operations
next week. The test plats will be on the

LOSQ BEACH VENTURE.
li'f.t Sugar factory to Be Built Hear

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 24.â The in
dications are that a beet sugar factory,
with a capacity equal to the one at Chino,
will soon be constructed on the Cerritos in
the neighborhood of Bixby Station and
not far from the town of Long .Beach, in
this county. The locality selected is said
to be well adapted to the production of a
splendid beet, rioti in saccharine matter.
Reports from the agents in New York re
garding the placing of bonds for the en
terprise are reassuring, and it is expected
that work on the factory will begin soon.
fatally Beaten in a Fight.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 24.â John
Bellew was found early this morning on
East Second street, suffering from a frac
tured skull. It is said he had been in
company with three other men. A fight
had evidently taken place between the
quartet, as two pools of blood were found
on the oppoÂ»ite side of the street, and
near by was a heavy cane made from a
billiard-cue, with which Bellew had no
doubt been struck. Bellew was too dazed
to give much information, and tho police
have not made any arrests. The doctors
held a consultation this afternoon and
pronounced that Bellow's injuries were
fatal.
Souta'a Musical Contribution.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 24.â A meet
ing of the fiesta executive committee
was held yesterday, when appointments
to the various committees were made. It
was reported that John Philip Sousa will
compose a new march for the fiesta, to be
dedicated to the people of Southern Cali
fornia.
SANTA CRUZ REFORMS.
Tramp Nuisance Eradicated at but a
Slight Expenne.
BANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 24.â The re
cent effort of District Attorney Carl Lind
say to reduce tbe tramp nuisance by be
ing present in pers n or by deputy at all
trials for vagrancy has created a great
deal of discussion as to the amount of fees
made by constables by arresting vagrants.
According to the rÂ«ply made by County
Clerk Ed Martin to the Committee on
County and Township Government of the
State Legislature, whicn asked for the in
formation, the total amount paid to con
stables during the year 1896 was only $2228,
and the sum paid Justices of the Peace
only $1949.
These amounts are divided between ten
constables and ten justices, so that the
vagrancy expense is less than was sup
posed, considering the other duties per
formed by the justices and constables.
The fact is made more apparent by these
figures that Santa Cruz County has a
minimum vagrant element, which is
steadily being reduced through the efforts
of the District Attorney ana the Salvation
Army, the latter supplying work for the
unemployed.
Fresno Cutting Affray.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 24. â William
Bridges, a leader in colored circles of this
city, wa3 slashed with a razor to-night by
another negro named Partee. The wound,
though an ugly and cry painful one, is
not serious. The cut extends from the
crown of the head downward and under
the right ear to the cneek. It required
fourteen stitches to close it. It appears
that Partee had been too intimate with
Bridges' wife, and to-night her husband
caught him in the yard at the rear of the
house. Partee then set upon Bridges and
did the cutting. Partee has fled and offi
cers are looking for him.

entertaining the delegates who have as
sembled to attend the Grand Lodge of the

the Grand Lodge where the visiting rep
resentatives have been accorded such a
hearty reception. The members of Hope
Lodge of this city are among the most
wealthy citizens of Stockton. They never
do things by halves, as was evidenced to
day and to-night Dy their treatment of
the visitors. Especial interest on the part
of Rtocktonians was taken in the gathering,

nine grand lodges, nearly 500 subordinate
lodges and more than 35,000 members
scattered through the most civilized
portions of the world. The order expends
millions of dollars in deeds of charity.
To-day's meeting of the grand lodge of
the Pacific slope was one of the most suc
cessful ever held. Officers will not be
elected until Tuesday, but in the mean
time the routine business of the order is
being attended to and the delegates are

largest tank will be 14x60 feet in dimen
sions, with a depth of 14 feet, and there
will be two smaller ones for women and
children. It is proposed to heat the water

FRESNO BURGLAR
COMES TO GRIEF
Tries to Enter a Rancher's
House and Is Badly-
Wounded.
Ignores a Warning to Depart
and Dashes Against a
Shotgun.
The Marauder Probably Crippled for
Lif) as a Reward for His
Indiscretion.
FREBNO, Cal,, Jan. 24.â Fred Bonn.an
was shot in the legs to-night by William
Hill while trying to enter the latter'a
house, a mile southeast of town. The
would-be burglar, who is a hard.looking
character, is now lying in the County Jail
suffering from two badly shattered shins
and with the prospect ol losing the use of
his rieht knee.
Hill says he first heard Borman walking
on the front porch of his house. Tae
rancher arose from bed and called to the
fellow to "get out." Looking through a
window Hill saw Borman waiting aroood
to the rear of the house. The rancher
then took his shotgun, loaded it and went
out to the rear porch. The burglar came
directly toward the steps and Hill stepped
out with his gun leveled and asked the
intruder what be wanted. Borman, see
ing the gun, sprang forward to grapple
with the rancher, crying out: "You will
shoot me, will you? I'll fix youl"
But Hill was too quick, and fired, aim
ing at the man's legs. The burglar
bounded into the air, gave an awful howl
and then foil in a heap on the ground.
His wailing and cries of pain were pitiful.
With the assistance of a neighbor, Hill
brought the rascal to jail. Borman sajrs
that he has been working at the Helm
ranch, but refuses to talk concerning
to-night's escapade.

II BIG HOLEJ HIS HEAD
It was a fearful accident which occurred
in Oakland yesterday, and it goes to prove
that carelessness is as dangerous as dissi-
pation, indulgences, excesses and abuses.
A big hole in a man's head is sometimes
easily patched up provided the individual
has been in good health and has not
abused himself or dissipated. There are
hundreds of men, however, who never can
recover because they have misused them-
selves in a variety of ways in early life.
You cannot stay out all night, drink a
barrel of whisky and continue to abuse '
yourself and retain your good health. V"
If you have indulged in any of these /
forms of abuses the sure and speedy cure
is the great "HUDYAN" remedy treat-
ment. "HUDYAN" cures nervous de-
bility, neurasthenia, melancholia and the
diseases and disabilities of man. "HUD-
YAN" has been used as a remedy treat-
ment by the great doctors of the Hudson
Medical Institute for many, many years,
and has been so perfected now that it is
absolutely certain to cure. If you have
not read the testimonials about "HUD-
YAN." or if you bave not read the circu-
lars about "HUDYAN," write for them.

BLOOD POISON.
It is certainly not known to the laity,
though it is true, that blood poison in its
first, secondary and tertiary state, if not
properly cured, will be carried down from
father to son. After three or four genera-
tions blood poison ends in scrofula, malig-
nant cancers, etc. You have a body to
protect, young man, and you owe it to
yourself, and to your children to be per-
manently and skillfully cured of blood
poi>on. If you are suffering from blood
poison, if you notice falling hair, glandu-
lar lumps on the tongue, lumps on the
back of the neck, sores, sore throat, loosen-
ing teeth, copper-colored spots on the
I body, consult the great doctors of the
Hudson Medical Institute about their 30-

UPON A PROPHET
Remorse Believed to Have
Caused a "Messiah's"
Suicide.
Ogden Police Searching; for the
Companion of the Late
McAllister.
Missing Man's Eff cts Found Among'
Thosj of the Strarg-r Who
Kilhd Himse f
OGDEN. Utah, Jan. 2i.-The mystery
surrounding the suicide last Tuesday of
the man who claimed he was the Messiah
has been deepened instead of dissipating
as the investigation proceeds. Tlie Coro
ner's jury has been working on the case
for two days and is awaiting further news.
So far the evidence that instead
of the dead man being George O. Davis of
Lefors, Tex., he is one McAllister, who m
December last stooped with a shoemaker
here for some time. At that time he was
doing duty as religions exhorter, warning
the people that the end of the world was
at hand. There was with him a deaf man
who claimed he was the one mentioned in
1.-aiah. This man is now supposed to
have been Davis. Davis received $600
from the Canadian Valley Bank at Cana
dian, Tex., late in the lull. Since they
left Ogden together, in December, Davis
has not been heard of and cnnnot be
traced.
He was to have returned with McAllis
ter and ii is wife, who came from Oakland,
Cal., this trip and with them brought
Davis' trunk. The wife has gone, it is
eaid, to Kansas City. McAllister remained
here and committed suicide.
In his possession was Davis' trunk. He
pr-tended to be deaf and told the county
physician that his name was Davis. At
times he cou d hear as well as any one.
A dozen people who say they knew McAl
lister declare that he wa* the suicide.
Nothing can be heard from Davis' peopie
st Lefors, Texas.
The impression prevails here that Davis
was murdered by McAllister, who toot
possession of the Texan's stock of this
world's goods, but remorse overcame him
and he ended his life.
Efforts are being made to trace Davis.
The Coroner's jury has as yet reached no
decision.
LOST HIS FORTUNE AT TACOMA.
California Mongol Who Was Going to
China a Prince Wi.l Return
a Pauper.
TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 24.â Lee Gem
Cow, an intelligent-looking young Chi
nese, appeared at the police station this
afternoon with a pitiful tale of having
been robbed of a draft on a Hongkong
bank for $1100, the accumulation of sev
eral years of labor in California. As nearly
as can be Fathered from the almost unin
tellisible English of Lee he was robbed
on Thursday night while asleep at the
â wharf in a tourist car, in which he arrived
about a week ago from Cal ifornia. After
his passage had been paid at San Fran
cisco he invested all his earnings, except
the few Ã¼bliars necessary to procure the
necessities for tbe trip, in a draft on a
Hongkong bank, which he kept securely
â pinned in an innÂ«r pocket ot his blouse.
It is the custom of the railway officials
at the wharf to assign Chinese arrivals
who are intended passengers to the flowery
Kingdom on the steamers of the company
to quarters on the second floor of the old
depot at the wharf until the place is filled.
Af:er that new arrivals are allowed to
jUeep in the tourist-car.-j standing on the
track near the buildincs. Lee was sleep
ing iv one of these cars when the robbeiy
occurred.
It is, of course, suspected that some of
his fellow Celestials Is responsible for the
disappearance of the money, out the po
lice have thus far only a very slight clew
upon which to work.
Lee has lived in California over five
years and earned his money by hard work
in a laundry and at market gardening.
He was returning to China as a prince,
intending to make his father a fine pres
ent, taKe to himself a wife and settle
down. Now, unless his draft is recovered,
he must return to San Francisco practi
cally a pauper and start tna saving pro
cess over again. He is lodging at the city
jail while the police are working.
PACIFIC GROVE ADVENTURE.
Salinas Resident Attempts to Capture a
Sea Lion and Barely Escapes
Alive.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Jan. 24.âWil
liam G. Conrad, who arrived last week
from his home in Salinas, met with a
peculiar accident yesterday. He was walk
ing along the beach near New Monterey
when his wife, who accompanied him,
saw a small sea lion sunning itself on a
rock near the shore. Conrad determined
to catch the little animal. Running to
McA bee's boathouse close by, he procured
a rope and, the tide being low, he crept
out with little difficulty to the rock where
toe sea lion lay. He found the little fel
low quite gentle and it was an easy matter
to fasten the rope around it.
Just as he was about to carry his captive
to the sbore a big wave struck them and
bore Conrad, who was standing on a rock
slippery with seaweed and kelp, entirely
off his feet. The wave dashed over the sea
lion and with a disgusted bark it dived
from the rock, taking the rope with iv As
Conrad had hold of the other end of the
rope, he was carried some distance from
the beacli before the suddenness of the
catastrophe and the amount of salt water
he had invoiuniar.lv swallowed permitted
him to realize the situation. Fortunately
for him, a young man upon the beach had
witnessed the whoie affair and promptly
came to his assistance, pulling him out of
the water more deaa thnn alive. He soon
recovered from the effects of his uninten
tional bath, none the worse ior the wetting
but disgusted because he had Jailed to
secure the sea lion.

on its junketing trip to-day visited the
Yountville Veterans' Home and the Napa
State Asylum lor the Insane. The com
mittee travels by special train. The Vet
erans' Home was first looked over, and
then the asvlura was visited. Here a ban
quet was in readiness, and when it nad
been partaken of the legislators were
driven to KiU3e's Canyon, the site of the
proposed new reservoir, which the asylum
trustees are asking an appropriation for.
in their annual report the trustees state
|'iai during the dry season the water sap
ply is inadequate, and therefore they ask
for an appropriation to build the reservoir
and dam, and buy land. It is also pro
posed to put an electric system, for which
water from the proposed dam will supply
the power. The appropriations wanted by
the asylum are $155,000 for these improve
ments, and $245,000 for maintenance, a to
tal of $400,000.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 25, 1897.
NATURE'S GIFT
TO SAN DIEGO
Finest Harbor on the Coast
South of the Golden
Gate.
Natural Port of Entry for the
Commerce of the Entire
Southwest.
Human Ingenuity Adding Improve
ments for the Accommodation
of Shipping.
SAN DIEGO, Cal , Jan. 23.â The pilot
chart of the North Pacific Ocean for
December, 1896, published by the Bureau
of Navigation at Washington, indicates
in a striking manner the very important
position occupied by the port of San
Diego, its proximity to the great circle
routes from China and Japan to Salinas
Cruz, the Pacific terminus of the Tehuan
tepec Railway, that the republic of
Mexico is doing so much to develop, and
from which in a few years' time a large
trade will radiate.
The stearasnip route from Yokohama to
Brito, the Pacific terminus of the Nica
ragua Canal, passes within 116 miles of
San Diego â six or eight hours' steaming.
From the topof Point Loma, the stretch
of land that so safely shelters the bay of
San Diego, could be seen the smoke of
steainÂ«rs bound from Brito to Hongkong
passing along the great circle route but
thirty-four miles away.
The nearest safe harbor to the north is
San Francisco, 482 miles distant. There
is no shelterin: cove to the south in
United States territory. San Quintin, in
Mexico, is the nearest harbor in that
direction.
What New Orlens is to the commerce of
the Gulf States so must San Dieeo be to
the southwest portion of our great coun
try.
For a time one western port controlled
all the trade of the Pacific, but as the re
sources of Oregon and Washington were
developed the facilities offered by Port
land, Seattle and Taconia were quickly
taken advantage of.
The growth of the Southwest was slower.
Many obstacles had to be overcome. Rail
roads had to be constructed through a
sparsely inhabited territory; dams
had to be built to impound the floods of
winter; miles of canals were excavated to
fertilize desert wastes; but the develop
ment, though somewaat retarded for a
time, is now making rapid strides; the
agricultural and mineral wealth of this
region is attracting a large population; it
is the Mecca of homeseekers to-day.
The natural port of entry for this vast
territory is San Diego. Situated iv lati
tude 32 deg. 40 mm. north, longitude 117
deg. 10 mm. west, there is very little of the
fog tdat at times proves so troublesome
farther north. An examination of the
records of the United States Sipnal Ser
vice for twenty year* past shows that at
San Diego there was on an average but
twelve ioggy days throughout each year
or about 3>Â£ per cent. Very seldom has
the wind attained a greater velocity than
thirty miles per hour. The average
velocity covering a number of years, as
shown by tho official records, is but 5%
miles per hour, and inasmuch as the har
bor is completely landlocked there is little
sea in the bay with the heaviest of winus.
Anchorage is safe in any part of the ship
channel.
The depth of water at the wide and safe
entrance to the Silver Gate at low tide is
22}Â£ feet and at high tide over 28 feet.
San Francisco at low tide has 243^ feet,
Columbia River for Portland 21 % feet. Bos
ton bas only 18 feet, ana New'Yors but
23V-3 feet.
'me bottom is uniformly good; no rocks
have been discovered in the bay or ap
proaches; tnere is much less swell on the
bar than on any other bar along the Pa
cific Coast, and there are no treacherous
currents to beach your vessel as you en
ter. Soundings in the channel entrance
to the harbor, as shown on the charts
issued by the United States Hydrographic
Office, note the presenca of only saud and
mud, which can be readily removed. No
rocky barrier exists that will have to be
mined and blasted out.
Tne fourth appropriation of $50,000
being available, contracts have been let
and work is again about to tie resumed on
the jetty, which is beiug built seaward
from the sanuspit south of the entrance to
the bay. The purpose of this work is to
concentrate the tide in one channel across
the outer bar and thui scour and per
manently deepen the cuannel.
The good results following this plan to
bridle the tides were w*ll illustrated at
Greytown, the Atlantic entrance to the
Nicaragua canal. The bay in front of the
town was formerly entered by quite large
craft, but a gradual drifting of the coast
and river silt closed ud the entrance en
lirely. For^ convenience in handling
freight the Nicaragua Canal Construction
Company deemed it advisable to imme
diately undertake the construction of a
jeity, hoping tlius to scour out the chan
nel. Scarcely 500 feet of this work had
been completed before a beneficial effect
was noticed and by the time the break
watej b,ad been extended 1200 feet tiie
swiri of the tide had been deflected and a
new channel opened up allowing the coast
ers to enter without difficulty.
A similar piece oi work on the Columbia
River increased the depih of the bar from
eighteen to thirty feet, and there is every
reason to suppose that the result will be
just as effective at San Diego giving a
depth over the bar at lowest tide greater
than will be needed for the passage of the
largest ships afloat.
Up to the present nothing has been
done toward foriifying the harbor, but on
November 29, 1896, a bid was accepted for
the construction of emplacements lor ten
inch gun batteries at BallaÂ«t Point, in
volving an expenditure of $170,000 princi
pally for labor, work to commence forth
with. The plan of harbor defense, as de
cided upon at Washington, includes
mortar batteries on the sand spit, south
of Hotel del Corotiado, whose range will
sweep the sea for miles, thus affording
ample protection to the city of San Diego
and the shipping in its harbor.
A flashlight at the extreme end of Point
Loma, built at a cost of $30,000. locates
the harbor entrance to the mariner when
miles away. Another light at Ballast
Point illuminates the entire channel.
Conveniently located near the entrance,
with a wharf running into deep water, is
the quarantine station, one of the most
complete in the United States, being
thoroughly equipped with a mo tern fumi
gating and disinfecting plant adequate to
all possible demands.
On the Coronado side of the bay is a
marine railway capable of accommodat
ing vessels of larjre tonnage.
Conveniently located near the water
front are well-equipped foundries and
machine-shops, fully prepared to do the
very best work quickly and at reasonable
figures.
The total area of the bay is about
twenty-two square miles, varying in
width, and about ten miles long, with a
ship channel from a half to three-fourths
of a mile wi le.
Over $500,000 has been spent on wharves,
ail of which run into deep water, with
from 18 to 35 feet at low tide. Some of
these wharves extend into the channel
from 2000 to 3500 feet. The longer ones
can readily accommodate from six to ten
of the largest vessels afloat. The wharf
age is ample for a large commerce and is
in first-class condition. Additional rail
way track < have recently been placed on
some of the wharves, piles have been re
newed ana strengthened, and everything
is in readiness to welcome the trade that
will soon seek this port. At present the
only outlet to the north and east by rail
is via the Santa Fe system. During the
past two years this company has been re
ducing grades, ballasting roadbed, re
placing wooden bridges with modern steel
structures; in fact gettina ready to handle
large consignments of freig t quickly and
cheaply. The saving in distance between
San Fedro or Santa Monica and Los An
geles ami San Diego and Los Angeles is
but trifling; handling and rehantlling
freight is what adds to the cost. The ad
vantages for receiving and discharging
merchandise ai all seasons of the year at
this port will more than compensate for
the difference in haul and must eventu
ally result in the entire shipping trade of
the great Southwest being handled at the
port of San Diego.
SHIPPING PUGET SOUND LUMBER.
Number of Vessels Chartered to Carry the
Outpu; to Sou.h America and
the Transvaal.
TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 24.â Foreign
lumber trade has taken a big spurt with
the beginning of 18^7. Shipments on a
large scale to South Africa, which were
cut off during the Transvaal troubles,
have been resumed. Several cargoes have
gone forward, and it is announced that
the British steamer Pelican, now en route
from Yokohama with tea, has been char
tered to load lumber here for South Africa.
The ship Senator, just off the drydock,
will begin loading this week for Deiagoa
Bay.
F. R. Lingbam, the South African
lumber king, started a lino of steam and
sailing vessels carrying lumber three
years ago ana in eighteen months shipped
about 40,000.000 feet from Puget Sound to
Deiagoa Bay. This line has been sus
pended, but Mr. Lingham is again corre
sponding with Pueet Sound mills with a
view of chartering more vessels. There is
also a stiff demand for lumber from the
Orient, Australia and South America. It
is reported 'hat Shanghai firms have
ordered 10.000,000 feet, most of which will
be cut at Port Blakeiey.
W. R. Grace & Co. of San Francisco
have six vessels chartered to load at
Whatcom for South America. Williams,
Brown & Co. and other San Francisco
lirmsare shipping to both Australia and
South America.
NORDICA SAYS FAREWELL
The Last Concert at the Baldwin
Theater Ends iD an
Ovation.
End of a Successful Season That Was
Gratifying to Artbis and Pub
lic Alike.
The curtain went down on the final
concert of the Nordica-Scalchi season last
night, amid what was a perfect outburst
of enthusiasm for the usually calm and
self-contained Baldwin audience. People
9tood up and cried *'brava," and beat
their hands together until the curtain was
raised again and the San Francisco public
was given its final admiring look for some
time to come, at the two gifted divas ana
Dempsey, Berthald and Lucks tone, who
have all been giving music lovers so much
pleasure for the last week.
It was the well-known quartet from
"Rigcletto :> that brought the concert to a
close. The programme was made up for
the most part of numbers that had grown
to be popularly as-o iated with the vari
ous singers during last week, but there
were a few new pieces, and the quartet
was one of them.
As an encore to Erkel's "Hungarian
Aria" Mme. Nordica sang "Une Nuit de
Mai," which she had not given before this
season.
It is a song much affected by ambitious
amateurs, and the artistic way in which
Nordica sang it was hailed with such dem
! onstrations df satisfaction that she could
! not resist another encore, and gave them
the little song that has become so popul.ir
since she revived it last Tuesday, "When
Lcve Is Kind." She also sang for the
rirst time the Bach-Gounod, "Aye Maria."
the violin obligato being played by
August Hinrichs.
Both times that Scalchi sang there was
an almost frantic desire on the part of
the audience to get her to respond with
"Annie Laurie." Her first aria was per
mitted to pass with a little encore 'by
Gounod, which she had sung before, but
when her second encore came there was
an anxious moment as Isidore Luckstone
struck some chords that were not the pre
lude of "Annie Laurie" ; then the audience
recognized the familiar brindisi of Orsino
from "Lucrezia Borgia," "II segreto per
esseT felice," and there was an outburst of
applause.
Scalchi sang the dashing drinking song
in the true rollicking spirit, and won the
applause she merited, but she was not to
be let off without "Annie Laurie," so
yielding to her fate she came on again and
sang it.
Barron Berthald sang a catchy little
son^ by Luckstone, "The Clown's Sere
nade," and Hawley's "Because I Love
You," and J. C. Dempsey gave the beau
tiful "Don Juan" serenade by Tschaikow
skv. Both urtists were encored.
The concerted operatic selections, both
of which aroused unlimited applause,
were the two from the last act of Gounod's
"Faust," Bung by Nordica, Berthald and
Dempsey, and the quartet from "Rigo
letto" mentioned above. The latter num
ber brought the concept to a close amid an
ovation which must have been very grat
ifying to the artists, for applause from a
lull house on the last nigtit of a S3*son
shows that the singers are not living on
their reputations, but have co.quered the
public.
There will unfortunately bd no more
farewell concerts, as the Nordica-Scalchi
troupe will leavs to-day for Sacramenlo,
en route for the East.
REOPENING DAY

Ingleside track reopens to-day. During
the past two weeks' spell of racing at
Oakland the talent has received many
hard knocks. Odda-on choices have
showed out flatteringly in front only to be
swallowed up by the field behind and fin
ishing â unplaced. To be sure racing is an
uncertain game, but to explain away the
many eccentricities of the sport across the
bay would require volumes.
To-day the scene of racing operations
will shift to the local track at Ingleside,
where horses backed by the public have
met with such uniform success. The pro- '
gramme of events includes all of the
different distances, furnishing a card that
is sure to please race-goers.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
It is reported that Olney will find a fine
law practice awaiting him in Boston, and
the country, of course, will be willing for
him to stay with it.
As it is now said that William Waldorf
Astor has the gout it would seem his
claims to be considered a British aristo
crat can no longer be disputed.
Olney has publicly congratulated Sher
man on his coming succession to the State
Department, and on the sly he is perhaps
congratulating himself on getting out.
Senator Hill says be wishes no political
obituary, which is not only equivalent to
saying he doesn't believe he is dead, but is
fairly good proof that he is live enough to
kick.
Whether the Legislature 13 to make the
session as a whole long or short is doubt
ful, but it is cutting the daily sessions in
both houses short enough to serve for
plug cut.
It is said that over 25 per cent of the
registered voters of Connecticut are bi
cyclers, but this is not the only reason of
the power of the machine in politics in
that State.
Sam Jones says he never in all his life
saw a place where sin is so respectable as
it is in Boston, and now Boston is in doubt
whether to regard tne saying as a compli
ment or a siur.
A Judge in Maine has declared the law
of that State does not recognize hypno
tism, ana now it is a question for a debat
ing society whether Maine is ahead of the
time or behind it.
Two years ago the Legislatures all over
the Union were fighting the theater hat
and now they are fighting/ the trusts.
Anything goes that promises to give the
world a show for its money.
Victoria has reigned for sixty years, but
she is so much younger than Gladstone
that she is afraid to abdicate less some one
should cite the case as an evidence tnat
woman is not the equal of man.
It is now said that it cost Richard
Croker nearly $1,000,000 to race his Lorses
in .England and get acquainted witn roy
alty, so it seems that while Wales may
have become common in some things he
still keeps up the price.
The new rule of -the State Department
forbidding our Em bassadors abroad from
making speeches on questions that divide
political parties at home is being generally
commended, but the friends of Bayard go
right along saying nothing.
It is prosposed in England to make the
celebration of the sixtieth year of the
Queen's reign a season of gifts to the poor
and of providing parks for small towns
and villages so the people will have good
reason to enjoy the occasion.
The city assessor of New Haven has
raised the assessment of Yale for taxation
purposes from less than $60,000 to more
than $400,000. As a consequence culture
and the Yale spirit have taken the war
path and a lawsuit is threatened.
The Chicago Health Commissioners have
declared the water supply of that city to
be unfit for children to drink and have
shut it off from the public schools, but as
the children will have to drink it at home
it is hard to see where the benefit comes in.
Some prying investigator has discovered
that the uniform of a colonel on the Gov
ernor's staff costs $100 in Massachusetts
and twice as much in Vermont, and now
there is a hubbub in the far East that
would stifle the noise of any racket Kan
sas ever made.
One of the notable features of the expo
sition to be held in Turin next year is to
be an exhibition of the rise and progress
of comic art, and if admission is permit
ted to the comic weeklies of this country
the exposition can be made to include the
decline and fall as well.
As a resuit of the construction of large
ocean steamers, it has been found neces
sary to dredge the Thames to allow their
entrance to the docks at London. By and
by ships may be so big that they will have
to do their docking on the ocean beach,
and any town inside a harbor will be out
side the channels of trade.
Since Governor Leedy of Kansas replied
to Eastern attacks on his iState by saying
Kansas has room enough in her s-chools
for all her children while the rich Eastern
cities have not, the cultured critics have
dropped the subject of education and re
turned to tbeir solemn and serious dis
courses on Western whiskers.
In default of any industry at which con
victs can be kept busy under the present
law, New York officials are discussing
the advisability of putting them through
a military drill every day. The move
ment it will be seen has the possibility of
proceeding so far eventually as to turn
every penitentiary into a West Point.
Among the measures before the Kansas
Legislature is one to dissolve the organiza
tion of several counties in the western
part of the State. The claim is made that
the counties were organized prematurely
as some of them have less than 2000 inhab
itants and are not able to support tbeir
governments. It is evident the West
Kansas boom which came up like the
grass has skipped out like the grasshop
per.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL
The extraordinary letter from Senor
Rodriguez, Minister of the Greater Re
public of Central America, wh eh was
read in the Senate on Friday, seems to
oppose an effectual bar to the passage of
the Nicaragua canal bill at this session of
Congress. The bar may be eventually
overcome, but it will require diplomacy
to do it, and the success oi the measure
therefore is now dependent not so much
upon Congress as upon the incoming ad
ministration.
In his letter Senor Rodriguez calls at
tention to the fact that the contract made
between the Nicaraguan republic and the
canal company stipulates that. the con
cession shall not be transferable to any
foreign power, and as he goes on to say
tne bill now be ore Congress .effectually
makes the Government of the United
States the virtual controller of the canal.
Therefore the contract would be violated
if the canal company should accept the
terms of the proposed bill, and the Greater
Republic of Central America would not
consent to the construction cf the work.
Other points are made by the Minister,
but they are of less importance. The ono
which is vital to the project is the one we
have stated. Tne United States is not
likely to grant a large subsidy to the canal
or to guarantee the bonds of the company
unless it is well assured that it will have a
virtual control over the canal both as a
commercial enterprise and for purposes of
war. We cannot undertake to build a
canal that is to be left in cbarge of a power
so weak a- Nicaragua, and so unstable as
the Greater RepuDlic. The Nicaraguans
could not defend the ca-nal for a single
day against a British force in case of war,
and the newly formed Greater Republic of
Central America may vanish from the
face of the earth before the close of this
year.
It can be well understood that the read
ing of the letter caused a marked sensa
tion in the Senate and was a heavy blow
to the advocates of the bill. Senator Mor
gan, with his usual vehemence, declared
the letter to be an insult to the Govern
ment. "With this threat flouted in our
faces," he said, "the Uniled S.ates Senate
might as well surrender its functions, so
far as dealing with foreign nations is con
cerned.'' He suggested that Great Britain
or some other foreign power hostile to
American supremacy in the isthmus
might nave prompted the Greater Repub
lic in interposing to prevent the action of
the United States.
These assertions, however true they
may be,, can have no effect upon the bill
as it siands to-day. The refusal of the
Greater Republic to admit a canal under
American control closes the subject for
the present. It does not, however, finally
determine the issue. The construction of
a canal across the isthmus is necessary
to the commercial prosperity of tfce
United States, and it will be the duty of
the incoming administration to provide a
means whereby it may be accomplished.
AN UNfAIR PROVISION-
The bill introduced into the State Sen
ate to regulate and govern the operation
of the rock-crushinc plant at Folsom and
to provide for the sale of crushed rock
contains a provision which, on the face of
it at least, seems to be altogether unfair to
the quarrymen of the State and should
have a thorough investigation before it is
adopted.
The provision in question occurs in sec
tion 4 and reads thus: "The sale price of
all crusned rock sold for other than high
way purposes shall be the cost of produc
tion with 20 per centum added, delivered
on board cars or other vehicles of trans
portation at the rock-crushing plant, pro
vided that no crushed rock shall be sold
for other than highway purposes for a less
price than 30 cents a ton."
It will be seen that this fixed price for
the sale of rock at Folsom is liable to work
a grave injustice to the rock-quarrying
indusiry of the State. It must be borne
in mind thav the piant at Folsom is pro
vided by taxation upon the people; that
all its machinery and repairs are paid for
by such taxation, that the labor em ployed
is that of convicts, and as a consequence
the cost of production cannot be great. If,
therefore, trie sale of it is to be fixed at a
20 per cent advance upon that production
it will in all probability ba far below any
possible competition by free labor.
Public opinion has long been adverse to
any competition of this kind between the
State and its people. It is expedient to
promote the industry of free men rather
than to crush it out by the power of the
State. It would seem that abundant work
could be furnished to the convicts at Fol
som in providing crushed rock for our
rural highways without setting them to
the task of competing frith the quarry
men who furnish rock for general bu'.ld
ing purposes, and if so it would be belter
to confine convict labor mainly to that
work.
, Jn the present demand for improved
highways a large amount of crushed rock
â will be needed iv all parts of the State,
and more will be required than Folnoni
can probably furnish. If rock for other
purposes than those of the State and the
counties is to be produced at Folsorn and
sold in the general market at all it should
not be sold at a rate unfair to free labor.
This clause of the proposed act, we re
peat, should be thoroughly investigated,
and if it is found to be in reality as unfair
as it appears on the face it should be
stridden out or else the whole bill should
be rejected.
CHANGES IN BANKING LAWS.
Among the most interesting and im
portant subjects to be discussed and acted
upon in the near future by Congress is
reform in the National banking laws. It
is improbable that any sweeping changes
will, for the present, be more than dis
cussed ; but it is almost certain that
changes small in form though possibly
large in their benefit to the public will be
promptly made.
Among the proposed measures of im
provement is the provision for tne organi
zation of banks with a capital of not less
than $-0,000 in small towns of not more
than 4UOO peoDle. This it is believed will
prove of advantage to the Western and
Southern States in many places where
banks at present are scarce by reason of
lack of capital to get together the $50,000
necessary for a National bank by the old
law.
Another proposal is to permit National
banks to increase their circulation to an
amount equal to the par value of tbeir
bonds deposited in the United (States
treasury to secure circulation. There
would be no dancer in this, for the bonds
are selling in the market for a premium,
and the note-holder has an additional
security by a first lien on the assets of the
bank. The reform would save banks from
Being compelled to tie up 10 per cent of
their capital by the restriction which
limits their notes to 90 per cent of the
bonds they deposit.
A more radical suggestion is that banks
siiouJd be perm tied to issue notes based
upon their reserve or assets and limited to
such proportion of the same as is found
reasonable by the statistics of failures.
To make this plan secure tue banks
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 25, 1897.
throughout the country wi'l be required
to pay a tax of 2 per cent on such note
issues to a fixed amount, the tax to be in
creased by a rapidly ascending scale for
additional issues up to a maximum of safe
circulation. The tax is to be held by the
Government to redeem the notes of such
banks as fail. The graduated tax, of
course, would have a tendency to make
currency flexible, as it would automati
cally force it in or out of circulation in
accordance with the urgency of business
demands.
One of the main defects of our present
currency system is its lack of elasticity.
Secretary of the Treasury Windom said
in his report for 1890 that our crops bad
grown to such enormous proportions that
their movement to market in August and
SeDtember annually caused a dangerous
absorption of money. It is to remedy
this defect the graduated tax plan is pro
posed. It is favored by many of the most
experienced bankers of the country and
will have strong support in Congress
The more sweeping changes proposed,
such as the so-called "withdrawal of the
Government from the banking business"
and the retirement of all United States
notes, will have lit ie chance of success at
present. The people are well satisfied with
the working of our system of greenbacks,
and the issue of tneir retirement will have
to be fought out at the polls before Con
gress would think of venturing upon it.
BENEFITS OF FORESTS.
Some years a^o it was a common belief
that forests were valuable on account of
the influence which they had on the rain
fall of the region where they grew. Those
who meld the belief supposed it had a
scientific basis, and regarded those who
did not agree to it as ignorant and unread.
The belief no longer finds universal favor,
and has been attacked by the reasoning
and observation of scientific men. The
assaults upon this time-honored notion,
however, do not alter the fact that forests
are of great value in other ways besides
their commonly understood utilities of
lumber and firewood.
At the recent meeting of the State hort
icultural Society of lowa Professor J. It.
Sage read a paper, in which he explained
the scientific conceptions of the great
value of forests to the country generally
aside from their worth for timber and fuel.
The professor is chief of the lowa Weather
and Crop Service, and he has a high repu
tation that gives his paper more than
ordinary value. After showing the fallacy
of the long prevalent notion that forests
affected rainfall, the professor stated that
the converse of this idea was undoubtedly
true. North America is the best watered
of all the continents, and tnis is the cause
of the immense forests with which the first
settlers found it covered. This entire
country, he says, never has been and never
can be stricken by general drouth and
famine. There never will be a season
when the United States will fail to produce
sufficient food for all the people.
The professor's first statement was in
teresting and the second was consoling,
but the most important point of his paper
was- the instruction to prenerve the rem
nants 01 forests that are left with religious
care and to continue to plant trees per
sistently. .Forests, ha explains, while they

conservators of water whan it does fall.
They cause an even distribution of the
flows, thus preventing the drying up of
wells, springs and streams and checking
injurious floods. Groves of trees, more
over, form shelter belts which mitigate
dry, hot winds and prevent rapid evupo
ration.
Professor Sage concurs with the opinion
that if a hftn of th ? land was devoted to
timber we could grow more crops on the
remaining four-fifths and prophesies that
in the coming era or intensive farming
forests and woodlands will be important
factors.
The lesson emphasized by this learned
student of conditions in lowa is not new,
but it is one which will bear considerable
iteration. The tern ptation to recklessly de
stroy forest growth, as well as the oppor
tunity to plant trees, are always with us,
and reminders of the folly of yielding to
the first and the wisdom of being betimes
in the use of the latter should be kept con
stantly before the people. lowa has to be
educated up to. the planting of forests.
California has only to learn to preserve
those which nature has eiv^n her.

San Joaquin Valley farmers are embarking
in the tobacco-growing industry. Here is one
result of an experiment, as reported by the
Stockton Independent: Stark Bmith, who re
sides about six miies east of Stockton on tne
Milton road, was in the city a few days since,
showing to some of his friends a sample bun
dle of tobacco raised on his place this fall. It
was of excellent tissue, good color and pleas
ing aroma. Mr. Smith said that he had planted
it as an experiment, but from what he had
learned he saw no reason why the plant could
not be grown profitably In the county.
"This was planted last July and it had at
tained the present size of leaf before fall. It
should have been planted in Murch, and would
not only have grown to a larger size but we
would have been able to cure it in the warm
wather, which would be much better for the
leaf. The tobacco should have been given a
natural sweat, but we did not havo enough of
it and so had to roll it up in a damp cloth and
Eweat it before the fire this winter. This par
ticular plant was raised from Havana seed and
lias dona well. I have an idea that an attempt
on a larger scale would prove fully as success
ful, and next summer I will possibly make it.
I am 'not particular about having the whole
honor, and wish that others would make the
attempt at the same time."
The people of Porterviile have a go-ahead
way about them that is bound to win in the
long run. They are determined to make the
best ol their climatic advantages, and soon
we shall have fresh winter tomatoes from
there. BayÂ« the Porterville Enterprise: "The
experiment of Phil M. Bair, G.T.Frost and
\V. Wood to grow tomatoes for the winter
markets has turned out successfully, and pick
ing and packing has now commenced at fcx
eter n on G. T. Frost's land, where a few months
ago thirty acres were planted out. It was at
first thought that in the event of any trost the
vines, which are very tender, would be killed;
but the spot chosen has proven itself free from
froÂ«t. Tne first carloads will be shipped to
Los Angeles and San Francisco. There are a
few small favored localities in the State where
tomatoes can be grown in winter, but no* in
such large quantities as in Tulare County. The
experiment proves that eventually carloads of
winter vegetables will be shipped from here,
as there are thousands of acres suitably situ
ated for winter vegetable growing, and the
E&stera markets will be enabled to supply the
trade, whereas before it has been very difficult
to obtain a variety of vegetables."
A change has taken place in the editorship
of the Pacific Ensign, the official organ of the
W. C. T. U. Mrs. Ada H. Van Pelt has re

field, while Mrs. Nellie Blessinz Eyster, a
woman of much force and cleverness, will
succeed to the editorial chair of the Ensign.
R. H. Magill Jr. of Alameaa has purchased

The Yuma Sun gives details of an enterprise
of the utmost Importance to the Colorado
Valley dwellers, it being designed to irrigate
ty means of a gravity di:ch several thousand
acres of land adjoining Yuma. Tiie Sun say<:
"To any one who has not seen the lower por
tion of the valley, some fiiteea or twenty
miles from Yuma, a trip there would be in
teresting. Thousands of acres of land, almost
as level a3 need be for the application of
water and covered In many piaces by huge,
spreading me-;qui:e, not close together, but
giving the appearanca of a fine Eastern grove
of walnut or chestnut where the undergrowth
has been removed, or even of an od uncared
/or orchard of apple trees. There is but little
salt in the land. The soil appears to ba per
fect."
The special irrisatiou edition of the Escon

The Redlands Citrograpk has started out on

the Redlands of a decad.- igo with the Red
lauds of to-day the Citrograph says: "But
what a change in the town and surrounding
country I Then a two-horse stage made six
trips a week to San Bernardino; now nearly
thirty passenger trains on three roads enter
and leave the town daily. Then there were
but a few scattering orchards; now Redlands
will ship nearly 700 carloads oi oranges this
season, to say nothing of other fruits. Then
there were not enough children to make a
school district. In fact those interested in the
formation of the Redlands School District
were compelled to wait a short time for the
enlargement of the census by reason of the
expected arrival of a little stranger in one of
the principal families of the settlement; now
there are more than 1000, and they are housed
in five commodious and elegant buildings."

Where hath thy gentle spirit rettl"
Hast thou a peaceful refuge found,
From all the pang* thai rent thy breast t
Oh heart that beat too fast and free
For rigid schoolmen's measure,
So quick to bleed for others' pain,
bo finely tuned to pleasure:
That saw a grace in common things
To sweeten lowly duty.
The wee sma' moosie's fragile life,
The daisy's modest beauty;
Have you, for all these hundred years,
Known rest from toll and trouble,

Sleeted in measure double? i *

From lips with singing weary.

Rings on adown the sees.

MAJOR McKINLEY AND THE YOUNG REPORTER.
President-elect McKinley is a man of admirable tact. In this respect he is a good deal
like Garfield, but even Garfield stumbled oc-
shot struck him. He didn't wince. He didn't flatter an eyelid. He leaned back and slowly
puffed the cigar, looking oS into illimitable space. His face was calm and inscrutable.
A brief silence ensued.
Then the Major leaned forward. He drew his bushy eyebrows down and looked almost
eagerly at the young man.
"I'll tell you how it is," he slowly said, "this weather is certainly very remarkable for this
time of the year."
Then he leaned back again and let a little curl of smoke circle above his head.
The reporter smiled at him. Then he smiled.
"We'll let it drop, Major," he said
Then the Major faintly smiled, too, and the conversation went right on again from where
the leading question had derailed it.

The recent report of General Miles on
the subject of coast defense at and, around
San Francisco ha 3 excited a great deal of
talk in various circles and it has been the
subject of much comment, it is asserted
that Lime Point with the necessary arma
ment would make it, as General Miles
says, "ihe Gibraltar of the Pacific," but
only so far as San Francisco goes. Those
who have given the subject of coast de
fense attention declare that it is not only
at San Frnncisco that there should be
perfect defense, but that the defense must
extend up and down the coast.

each man learn tne art of dome what he
is told to do, but he must familiarize him
self with a great deal that will make him
competent to maneuver a gun in case of
need. Modern gunnery requires intelli
gence and the men are being trained to
the degree of intelligence required.
The officers at the Presidio gave a recep

Gold buttons, clashing swords, hand
some men and elaborately gowned beauti

measures of the dance in the brilliantly
lit ballroom and formed a picture long to

make the hall beau if ul.
The cosiest chairs, the prettiest hang

appropriated from theofficera' quarters to
make the tete-a-tete nook inviting and
comfortable.
The men labored independently of the
ladies of the post and the excellent sup

artistic decorations are all to their credit.
Each officer was limited to three invita

WATCHING WITH
THE DETECTIVES
A Large Crcwd of Sunday
Visitors on Meiggs
Wharf.
The Dreamer Who Taw the
twanhilca in a Vision of
the Ni{?ht.
Genial Mike Fitzvra d Tells Weird
Ta'es â Arrival of the Snow
aa- Burgess.
A man walked down on Meiggs wh.Tf
yesterday afternoon and looked long and
absorbingly westward over the bay.
There was such a manner of confident
expectancy about him that a large crowd
of the half thousand visitors on the
wharf drifted around him. The wrecker
White^aw with her derrick masts towering
rloft was steaming out to seaafter a tow.
"That's her!" he said, almost breathless
ly. "There she is! I knew she'd be ia,
for I saw her in a dream just as plain as
can be. "What? Don't tell me that isn't
her; see those four masts. What do you
know abont the Swanhilda, anyway?
Probably you're acquainted with Butler.
I've seen the likes of you before. That's
her. I tell you, and she'll be here in half
an hour."
Then he went over to the police station
to tell the Aus ralian detective, McHattie,
to get his gun, while the boat with der
rick-masts towering aloit steamed out to
sea after a tow.
After the dreamer had cone to chase up
another vision, the crowd found another
sensation. Tie ferry's launch lay along
side of the wharf with steam ud, and an
other alarmist confidentially told around
that the little vessel was in readiness to
carry the squad of detectives out to re
ceive Butler. The informer verified his
statement by calling the crowd's attention
to the letter "P" on the bows of the
launcti, which he said, with marked
seriousness, could only be the initial let
ter of police.
This was corroboration not to be gain
said, and the graceful little craft was the
center of attraction until it took a steward
aboard with his marketing and steamed
onto the revenue cutter.
Then a sch oner was seen coming
through the foe arouni Fort Point and a
thousand eyes bore directly on her until a
puff of wind blew away the thin white
veil and revealed her familiar lines. The
report that a bark was sighted from Point
Lobos put an edge upon the excitement
until she was made out to be tb> Snow
and Burgees, sixty-one days out from
Sydney. Even a rockbaree towed out
from Black Point was made to pose as the
Swanhiida until some of the wheelbarrows
on the deck were made out.
Between the acts an orchestra on board
the Pprry discoursed divine melody- The
musicians were the cutter's bugler, tliref
drurumeraand a manipulator of the tri
angie. Tne sound it made was Â»oul-har
rowing and t^t a{l the dogs on the wharf
to howling. But tne musicians were in
dustrious and kept to t eir programme
until the captain of thÂ« cutter put a stop
to it.
Detective Mctfattie and his partner,
Constable Conroy, came in for much at
tention as the men who would convoy
the colonial murderer back to the Aus
tralian gallows.
Wh n tiie crowd wanted any special in

mciure of the murderer now approachiner
this coast that made bis audience caich
their breaths. He maj>p?d out the plan
of the fight that wouM probably take
jlace when the officers attempted to arrest
the Australian killer. The delay of the
Swanhilda was explaine I fully and her
absence was a mystery no longer.

watched the Golden Gate closedown in
the night. Tne Snow and Burgess was
towed in long after dark and though she
brought no news the visitors stilt watched
her, in some way associating the Ameri
can bark with the big Briiish four-master
and her passenger. Finally they left one
by one and the wharf was deserted.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT.
Henry Peterson Has Made an Addi
tion to His Fleet.
Henry Peterson, the well-known cham
pion oarsman of California, has made an
addition to bis fleet of gasoline steamers
and Whitehall boats. Latterly be has
found great difficulty in handling ships'
stores, so he had a .i^mer built expressly
fo- the work. Yesterday she was launched
irom the ways near Hunters Point, and
Mrs. Peterson christened iier Vera as she
glided into tbe waters of the bay. After
ward the launch Amy took the Vera in
tow and brought her to Folsom-street
w arf, which will be her home port in the
fu"ire.
The American ship May Flint seems to
be always in trouble. From tbe day she
was converted from a British steamer into
an American sailing s ip up to the present
there has never been a voyage but that
there has been some complaint. The last
time sue was here the captain was accused
of ill-treating the men and this time the
mate was arrested. Now there has been
trouble oyer the shipping of the new
crew.
The captain ma<le an arrangement with
one of the shipping masters by which he
was to get men at $15 a month and $25 ad-
vance. Out of this somebody was to cet
$60 and "poor Jack" was to be out and in
jured to that extent. Before anything
was done John Cane put in a bid and got
the job of shipping the twenty-two men.
The contract was signed in the office of
the Shipowners' Association and accord
ing to it each sailor got $15 a month and a
$25 advance, less a rebate of $4 and an
extra dollar, which is the shipping master's
fee.
The matter of stopping money out of a
sailor's advance has b-en laid before the
United States Shipping Commissioner,
and an investigation will be heid. The
May Flint sailed for Honolulu in ballast
yesterday to load sugar for New York.
The schooners Czar and Pinole were
close neighbors in Mission Bay yesterday,
and ret neither captain seemed anxious
to come to close quarters. The Pinole has
100 tons of dynamite on board, which S'ie
brought down from Pinole Point, and the
same cargo will be put on the Czar some
time to-day. From here the explosive will
go to Central America and will there be
used in the gold minps.

The large meeting-room of K. K. B. Hall,
at Mason and O'Farrell streets, was
crowded with representative Irishmen
yesterday afternoon, when the St. Pat
rick's Day Convention assembled to make
preparations for the celebration of the
cominc Irish national festival.
Thomas R. Bannerman called the meet
ing to order. He said it afforded him
great pleasure to see such a full represen
tation of Irish societies present, as it
showed that the true spirit was fresh and
vigorous as ever.
As the minutes of the last meeting in
1896 were not available, J. P. Henry, the
financial secretary, read his report, show
ing a balance in the Hibernia Bank
amounting to $579 72.
The chairman expressed his grateful
apprec ation of the confidence and esteem
of the 1896 convention, and his thanks for
the honor conferred upon him. And he
felt he rpoke the truth when stating that
last year's celebration of St. Patrick's day
was a credit to tiie Irish element oi San
Francisco.
A resolution was adopted thanking the
chairman and officers and the convention
adjourned sine die. R. J. Reilly, Becre
tary of the 1896 convention, took the chair
temporarily and called the 1897 conven
tion to order.

that the pretensions of England were not
in good faith, as she was strengthening
her fortifications on the frontier. They
were unanimously adopted.
A resolution was adopted calling for the
appointment of a committee of five to
drult resolutions of respect ior the mem
ory of Daniel F. Hanlon, a iormer presi
dent of the St. Pa rick's day celebration.
After this the convention adjourned to
meet next Sunday.
JAILEES IN UNIPOEM.
Chief Sattler and Liis -quad Will Don I
the Gold and Blue.
Chief Jailer Andrew Sattler at the old
County Jail on Broadway is determined \
to have the officers under him put on a j
smart and neat appearance by donning a
uniform. This innovation the chief con
siders necessary in order to have the
jailers distinguished from trusties and
visitors.
"It often occurs," said he, "that
strangers who desire to visit the jail are j
as lik^iy to address their conversation to
one of the trusties in asking for informa- |
tion as tney are to one of the Deputy i
Sher.ffs on duty. And again, we all recog- j
nize the fact that uniforms command a
respect and obedience not always accorded |
an officer in citizen's clothes.
"Then again, the officers will look Better j
and their positions will be more easily dis
tinguished by all about the prison. This
innovation, of course, mcc s with the fuii j
approval of Sheriff Whelan and with that j
of every man about the jail in authority. 1 '
The un.form to be worn by the jailers
will consist of a sack coat with brass I
buttons, a cap with a gold device in iron; ;
and the word "chief,'' or "captain," or j
whatever position the wearer may rill, is |
wrought in gold letters inside the device. I
The cap worn by the chief has a heavy i
band of gold with a cord in front of the i
same material. The other officers lack j
the gold band, but have their office i
wrought in gold in front. The material is j
blue cloth, and when stripped of its brass j
buttons, can be worn on the street.
Although Constantinople looks superb
from a distance, it is, perhaps, the dirtiest
town in Europe.
BUTLER AND THE
BARK ALEXANDRA
Attempted to Beguile the
Chief 0 fic^r From
His Vessel.
Told Tales of Fabulous Wealth
to Be Found in the Gold
Mines.
Arriv 1 of the Sncw and Burgess
I hat Sailed a Day After the
Swanhil.a
The arrival, of Murderer Butler is still
the one subject discussed on the water
front. When the American bark fnow
and Burgesa hove in sight off the Fara
llons every one began figuring on the
chances of her being the gwanhilda.
When the ye sel was made out then there
was a rush to figure out the number of
days she was out from Sydney and to
compare her time with that of the Swan
hilda. The result showed that the Snow
and Burgesa sailed a day after the British
ship, but has beaten her into port. Toe
captain of the Snow and Burgess reports
nothing unusual as having happened
during the voyage. He made the run
direct for San Francisco, and if reports to
hand can be reiied upon the Swanhilda
went south and made her way around the'
Fiji Islands. It was in the neighborhood
of ihe group that she was spoken by the
Union Sie;imship Company's Taupo and
papers put aboard telling about the mur
ders. The Hawaiian Isles also made the.
southern passage and got in here without
sighting the Swanhhda. Still that is not
to be wondered at, as the Hawaiian Isles
sailed several days before the Britisher.
Chief Officer Blackstoclc of the British
bark Alexandra has a story of his own to
tell about Butler. His vessel is chartered
to loa lumoer at Puget Sound for West
Australia, and is tnus going back to the
scene of the recent murders. The vessel
is now lying in Mission Bay and will load
there for the voyage to Australia.
The Alexandra came here from Sydney,
and it was only by the merest chance that
Chief Officer Blacks tock came on her
While the vessel was lying at Circular
Quay, Lee Weller (Butler) put in an ap
pearance and made the acquaintance of
all on board. He told long stories about
ricii gold mines and places where gold
could be washed out of the sand at the
rate of $50 a day. Blackstock had over
$500 coming to him from the ship, and he
decided to draw it out and invest it in one
o; Butler's ventures. Something came in
the way and Butler *vent to the mines
without Blackstock for a companion.
Early in October last the two men met,
and after a mutual agreement it wns
decided to leave for the mines on October
10. A few days later a hitch occurred, and
on October 19 the Alexandra sailed for
San Francisco with Chief Officer Black
stock in his old position.
The Alexandra is well known in San
Francisco. The laÂ»t time she visited this
port ncr cargo of coal was on fire and the
insurance company lost considerable ,in
consequence. From here she will co to

Last Thursday evening California Lodge No.
1, F. and A. M-, was honored for the forty
eeventh time by the annual visit of William
Schuyler Moses, who, with one exception, is
the oldest living Mason in term of Masonic
service in the State of California.
Mr. Moses had received permission from the
â worshipful master to enter the lodge room in
the costume that prevailed in the very early
days of California, when he first joined the
order in this State. The visitor, a tall man,
â¢who is getting well along in years, but who
etill looks like a ma;, of 50, with full long
black whiskers, a kindly face and sharp black
eyes, passed through the portal attired in lone
jack boots, pantaloons tucked into these, and
trie pantaloons, which had seen some rough
usage, had been patched in places with ma
terial of another color, put on with "home
ward bound stitches," a blue shirt and DlacK
cravat lied in a hard old-fashioned knot. The
pantaloons were neld up with a bright red
si ken sash, one of those that was the pride ol
the natives before Fremont came to California.
6:ung to bis right side in a holster was one of
Colt's single-action revolvers and in the riÂ«ht
bootleg was seen the handle of a twelve-inch
bowie-kni:e, "rough, but always ready." On
his head was a brown vicuna sombrero, one of
those which a gentleman of the period deemed
requisite io complete his toilet. In that Ftiire
the visitor was a correct type of the miner of
early California, jusi as he was iti the days
when gold was washed in the pan and in the

cradle. To make him the miner-Mason he
wore the emblematic apron, one which had
been his father's and by him worn in 1821 in
Valley Lodge, -No. 109, in Rochester, N. V., at a
time when there was a great excitement, which
was known as the "Morgan exposure," lie also
wore a pin which LelongeU to his father and was
adopted during tbe Morgan excitement to enable
brothers of the order to recognize one another.
Th- venerable visitor was met at the portal by
Franklin H. Day, pa<t master of California Lodge,
who ed him to the altar and presented him to the
worshipful master, who In turn mviteu htm to a
seat on bis right, in th" east.
The visitor before taking his seat, addressing the
worshipful matter, stated that his surroundings
reminded him of the lai t that he w:-s in t lie lodge
room and in the midst of brothers, and there being
no further use for arms therefor* would remove
ouch as be had, and did soâ the knife and revolver
were placed out of sight under the old sombrero.
Then there was the conferring of the second de
gree in due form, after which MÂ»j r E. A. Sher
man of Oakland, himself one of the pioneer Masons
ot th? -ta .c a' d tires id en I of the Masonic Veter
ans of the United States, naves review of the Ma
sonic work of the venerable visitor. He stated
1 hat he ml one of the two living members in Cali
fornia who were present oil April 19, 1850. when
the Grand Lodge of irornia was instituted, the
< thcr member heine Johc A. Ti.u ot Woodland,
Yolo County, past grand master of the Grand Lodge
of California. Â«ho is now in his eighty-fourth year,
and staled that the visitor was present at. the elec
tion of the lat â¢ Jonathan D. Stevenson as most
worshipful grand master of the Grand Lodge of
(3a ifornia He also stated that the visitor is, with
lhe exception of Mr. Tutt, the oldest past master
by service.
Further in giving in detail the Masonic history
of ' the ol i miner- Ma'on." Mfior Sherman stated
that he has been prominently identified with Ma
sonry In this State from the earliest limes: that, be
was master of Golden Gate Louge iv ISSVS and
since then has filled almost every station from
minor offices to that of venerable grand master of
the Scottish Kite; that he is the Â«iand Bible
bearer of the lodge, it being customary to confer
on the oldest member of the lodge the honor of
bearing the holy wrniugs.
Mr. Moses enjoys the proud distinction of being
the only Mason in the Stale of Â« alilornia upon
whom the Supremo Council of the southern juris
diction of the United states (mother council of
the wond) Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite
of. Freemasonry has conferred the order of the
Grand Cross. A feature of this ord-r is that it
can be conferred upon but one In earn State, and
cannot be conferred on another .while the one
upon whom li was conferred lives. He is the first
forma Mason who has received this honor, and
mere are but four others iv Hie United Mates who
are members of the ordÂ»r of the Grand Crossâ <>na
in Uregou. another in Washington, ibe third in
the District, of Columbia mid the lourth in lowa.

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
Return of Former Pros
perity and Confidence
Is Slow.
The Situation Has Not Yet
Changed Materially for the
Better.
Ben fi:ia Eff cts in Country Property
bj Reascn of tb.3 Prospects for
Better Prices for Products.
The real estate situation has not changed
materially for the better as yet; but then,
considering the low ebb to which the market
had fallen the return to former prosperity and
confidence must naturally be slow.
California has, however, about turned the
long lane and will soon be looking ahead.
There has been no time in iis somewhat re- I
markable career when the future seemed more j
assured. In the early years of the State its
prosperity depended upon unstable in
dustries. Mining was then the chief
of our productive occupations and the
threat was alwnys over us that mining
uould soon cease to be profitable. So little
confidence was felt In the stability of our
mines tnat most men who were iortunate
enoush to realize early expectations took
themselves and their money to more stable
fields of enterprise.
Mining is still a leading industry, but is only
one of several. Even mining has ceased to be
the harvest it once was. Agriculture, horti
culture and manufactures are now tiving fair
returns to capital and labor. The tone of busi
ness has become more conservative. Men have
given up trying to make fortunes in a day
and are dawning on slow and sure profits.
In the last year or two the attention of capi
tal has been directed to measures to distribute
the money taken from people of the State. To
this end industries are being established to
supply the wants of our people.
Our look ahead embraces kindred factories
located on all ihe shoreline of the bay, refining
iron ore into steel and fashioning steel into
watchsprings and other forms of the higher
use; weaving cotton and wool Into cloth and
fashioning cioih into costly garments, and in
other ways, taking the low-priced raw mate
rial and adding to it a hundred-fold in value.
Our greater prosperity lies in the ucequa:ed
adVHntag s nature has given us to become one
of the (tieat centers of industry in the world.
Meantime we are moving in the right way.
The most notable event ot recent date has
been the construction ot the Valley Railroad
from Stockton to Fresno. The next year will
no douot witness the completion oi a line
from San Francisco to Bakerstield.
This railroad, under the control of men who
have the good of the State at heart, willl bind
the broad and rich San Joaquin Valley to San
Kran Cisco.
One enterprise will pave the way for an
other. Ihe succe>sof one will serve to show
what can be done with another. The oilier
forty-four States of the r-.ion hold out no
such promising field far investment in land.
A little of the energy that has often bten mis
directed in the past will put California in the
.'oremo-t group of States. There remains but
three years more of the ninet?enth century,
and within that time many of the things
herein predicted will be accomplished facts.
The outiook for better prices for wheat, fruit
and wine is good, but perhaps the most cheer
ing fact of all is that the wuU'r Injected into
the prices of farming lands by booms and
boomers has been nearly all squeezed out.
Hard times, low prlC3s for land products and
I many foreclosures of mortgates did this. All
I of these things were reckoned as misfortunes,
and they were misfortunes, too, but misfor
tunes no: without some compensation.
A very thinly settled and very extensive
country, with remarkable gifts in the variety
andvaiueof Its land products, has no need to
great as that of population, and we all know
that nine out of ten newcomers who in very
few cases are men of means, if iheycometo
live by tiliine the soil, oÂ»n possibly buy laid,
especially fruit laud, at the prices to which it
had been biulooneU nve or ten years atro.
Land â the best of our ltuui â can now be
bought at one-third or one-half the prices at
which it was then selling. Ihat the vinous
events nnrned, which led to the general lower
ing of prices, involved nrucii misiortune nnii
punishment there is not ihe slightest doubt.
Tnat these misfortunes aud punishments were
wholly undeserved in some cases is undoubt
edly true, but the most of what happened was
inevitable and much of it was deserved.
The general result, in the much-deeded re
duction of price of land and the resulting en
courageuient of real set tiers u> buy it will, in
the end. greatly outweigh the uousiortuiiea.
Everybody, too, living off the soil, has been
taught the mucii needed les-son that those
who buy land must till it, and that to calcu
late that the enormous profits from fruit lands
which were reaped in seasons ot hi^h prices
and in isolated cases, would be general aud
continuous, was the height of folly.
Those, therefore, who bought at high prires
and mortgaged heavily to buy. as so ninny did,
were all fooled iv cv culatiug tnat tuey could
speedily 3ell out at a higher price to bigger
fools or more reckless speculators than them
selves.
In snort the old lesson has been learne*d by
farmers, after, many heavy stripes, that
economy, hard work and keeping out of debt
constitutes the only reliable road to progress
and create the only real guarantee of pros
perity.

The Fifth Piank in the Republican

Uneasiness.
Oakland OFFirE Bah Fkanciboo Call.^
Broadway. Jan. 24. y
No one who attended the People's!
party convention iasi Tuesday night
could help but wonder where the party ;
has gone. Three months ago when the
county convention assembled in Ger- i
mania Hall it was a party of life. There
was a fight for every office and the nomi
nations were regarded a? of some value.
The headquarters throughout the cam
paign were liberal. y <iecora;rd with pic-
1 1 res of Wiliiam J. Bryan and C. D. Lane,
.^ere was a healthy appearance on all
- ;es.
Monday night the hall where the con
vention met was like an ice chamber.
There was a scarcity of delegates and al
most an entire absence of lobby, and a
marked disinclination to accept a nomi
nation. Eifiht people were nominated for
chairman and each speedily declined.
Wh oever It fore heard of a Populist de
clining the honor of presiding at a con
vention? Many prominent faces were
missing and there was a marked absence
of office-holders. Mayor Davie was not
even mentioned and J. M. Basseti was
forgotton.
Somehow or other the Populists of Ala
meda County forget their party affiliations
as soon as they co into office, and this was
particularly manifest at the late conven
tion. There were but a few true and tried
populists in evidence. When corn and
wine are plentiful so arÂ«Â» Populist?, but in
"a dry year" the advocates of "'principle
only are woefully scant. At least that is
the case in Oakland.
Fred A. Campbell has not yet recovered
from the shock he received from the Re
publican convention. He was chairman
01 the City Central Committee and ar
ranged all the details for the work of the
committee of twenty-one, wnich wrested
the party machinery from the old-timers.
The nominations were closed, the new
City Central Committee named and the
name of Campbell was not mentioned.
No one can express the situation better
than Campbell himself.
"Here is the whole thing In a nutshell,"
he said. "1 arranged the political ban
quet and invited the guests, and they all
came and partook of my good things.
They gave away everything worth having
and helped themseive? liberally. I was
not even asked to participate, and as to ;
deriving anything from the display per
sonally that was out of the question. :
While my guests were in the banquet hall
2 was graciously permitted to -iook in
ihrodgh a window and was not even in
vited to a seat."
And every word of hi 3 story is abso
lutely true.
Mayor Davie was reminiscent yesterday.
To a few friends he thus ruminated: "For j
nearly four years the people of this city i
saved half a million dollars annually in :
ferry fares because I dared to run a ferry
in opposition to the railroad com
j any. I am informed that 6,000,000 of
people use the ferry every year and they
would still bo paying the old rates but lor
my competition. In a few weeks a de
cision is expected from the Supreme Court
that will confirm the city's title to her
water front.
"But for my fight six years ago, when it
was necessary to defend our property
asainst the armed hirelings of the railroad
company, there would have been no agita
tion to recover that valuable property. It
was Councilman R. B. Snell, I believe, who
stood on a pile and gained some notoriety
by railing to our steamer to enter Broad
way wharf, tut it seems to be forgotten
that ii the Davie ferry bad not been there
it would not have been necessary to find a
wharf for it.
"Only two years ago I stated that a
dollar tax should run the City, and I kern
my word, and the City was well run. But
who remembers these things now â who
has a good word for Davie?"
There are many who think that there is
a big surprise in store for the Mayor next
March.
For some reason or other the rosy fea
tures of Assessor Dalton wear a perplexed
look. Since the convention he has
walked up and down Broadway with his
eyes fixed at an angle with the horizon o'
about forty degrees less than of yoie.
The reason ie fouud in the fifth plank of
the Republican municipal platform,
which concludes: "They must keep out
of politics, and not seek to control party
nominations or the actions of municipal
officers to the detriment of the people and
/ the public good, and we therefore con
demn all efforts on, the part of county of
*rs, or other person or corporation, to
tain influence or control in municipal
ctflces for tneir own ends."
One of t:.e keenest politicians in the
city thus outlined the situation to-day,
and although there may be many who
differ from him, there are others who
declare he got very near the kernel of the
nut.
"Two years hence," he said, "a county
assessor will have to be elected and Mr.
Dalton will, of course, make an effort to
succeed himself. It very naturally fol
lows that if Mr. Dalton could cut a lead
ing figure in municipal politics In this
campaign he would lose nothing
by doing so in November of
1898. Now Harry snould not have been
ho thoughtless. He should have remem
bered that 'there are others.' Those 'oth
ers' had ideas ol their own about running
municipal politics, and they took a. very
politic way oi reading the riot act to him.
It certainly did not apply to Sheriff I
White or Mr. Snoot, or Treasurer San
ford, and nobody ever heard Myron
Whidden say a word kbout local politics,
and Dr. Wilson, who was on the platform
. committee, cprtainly would not hit his
friend Frank Jordan, so there you ar<>."

an article concerning a contemplated more on

gleaned to create the opinion among those

It is not necessary to point out to you tne

it necessary to say how much more sad the

The Old Boys' Brigade Suc
ceeded by a Newer Or
ganization.
Important Changes Made in the Ey-
Laws and as to the Enforcement
of the Pledge.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 24 [
The Brigade organization in the State of
California, which comprises the Second
and Fifth Regiments of the Old Boys'
Brigade of California, located around the
bay, became a thing of the past last
Thursday evening by unanimous vote of
the board of officers of the organization.
According to orders from regimental
headquarters, signed by Col. E. J. Walker
and his adjutant, H. P. Hobson, the meet
ing of the First Brigade, old Boys' Bri
gade of California, was called at tbe First
Pre;-byterian Church, Alameda.
The reason that Col. E. J. Walker issued
the orders, and the reason for his being in
the chair, were that some time ago Briga
dier-General J. Harry Russell, who was in
command, resigned on account of business
complications, and Colonel Walker, being
the senior colonel, assumed command.
Before the disbanding of the Brigade
organization tbe board of officers turned
all moneys and supplies over to the Sec
ond Regiment. They a;so placed the re
maining portion of the debt on the Fifth
Regiment, which has its headquarters in
ban Francisco. 'Hie reason for the last
act was that the Second Regiment had
paid more than its share (more than half)
and they now hold papers from all the
creditors, releasing them from any fur
ther obligations.
Tbis means that the Second Regiment,
under command of Colonel E, J. Walker,
has not a cent of debt, this state of affairs
being largely due to the Ladies' Auxiliary
of Alameda and Oakland, and to Paymas
ter B. L. Weymouth of the Second Regi
ment.
After the adjournment of the brigade
meeting Colonel Walter called a meeting
of the board of officers of the Second Regi
ment. At this meeting Paymaster Wey
mouth submitted a detailed report of the
finances. It was received â¢with great
favor, as it allowed a balance on hand of
about $15.
The resignation of Captain B. L. Wey
mouth as paymaster was read and, after
many speeches by the officers expressing
regrets, it was accepted. Captain Wey
mouth has labored long and hard for the
boys, and it was his wish that the officers
I relieve him of those duties. The officers
j have not lost him, however, as he is the
I captain of Company I in Alameda. Major
Al Taylor took the position of paymaster
temporarily.
The resignation of L. N. Cobbledick a3
major of the Second Battalion was read
and accepted.
New by-laws were presented by Lieu
tenant M. D. Bird, and, after being read,
it was moved to lay them over for one
meeting. A lengthy discussion followed.
It touched at the very foundation of the
Boys' Brigade â that is, whether the triple
pledge of the Boys' Brigade should be
enforced. Colonel Walker, Major Taylor
and Captain Weymouth were strongly in
favor of it, while others thought that it
might be better to let applicants join and
later on enforce the pledge. The pledge
i reads as follows and is enforced in all
companies of the Second Regiment:
I promise and pledge, that go long as I am a
member of the Boys' Brigade, that X will not
use tobacco nor intoxicating liquor in any
form; that I will not use profane, vulgar or
I indecent language; that I will obey faithfully
I all the company rules, and that 1 will, at all
times, set an example of good conduct to my
comrades and other boys.
One of the new officers said to-day: "It
might oe well to state that as so much has
been said against General Russell's policy
in managing Brigade affairs, that he is not
held totally responsible for the recent
Santa Cruz debt. General Russell is a
man that has suffered unjustly at the
j hands of his follow officers. As is always
the case when a man comes into power,
he is severely criticized. Mr. Russell made
mistakes, but he did it in good faith. He
always worked for the best interest of the
Brigade, going so far, sometimes, as to im
pair his health. He was sincere and con
scientious in all his dealings."

Threatening Anonymous
Letters Given to the
Police.
Matteo Ghiglione and His Wife
in Mortal Dread of
Death.
A Fugitive From Justice Supposed to
Be the Cause of All the
Trouble.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 24.â The police
are in receipt of a letter directed to Matteo
Ghiglione, in which the latter's life is
threatened. While every effort is being
made to discover the writer of this and
other threatening epistles, the officers of
the law refuse to give out any informa
tion. They believe that tne writer is in
Italy and is a member of the deadly
MATTEO GHIGLIONE, Who Has Been Receiving Threatening
Letters.
Mafia which has been the cause of so
many assassinations in this country. In
this they are backed by the opinion of
Guiglione and his wife, who ltve in deadly
fear of their unknown enemy.
The anonymous correspondent has on
several occasions demanded money from
Ghiglione and is believed to be connected
with a terrible tragedy committed in San
Francisco several years ago.
Ghielione lormerJy had a partner in his
vegetable business out on Bay Farm Is
land named Afilo Felice, alias Creon
Croan. Milo fell in love with an Italian
beauty of the San Francisco colony and
wooed well. His suit was accepted, but
his prospective father-in-law, Aut-ust
Capuna, would not countenance tue
match. Quarrels ensued ana bad blood
was in evidence. Finally, on the night of
May 19, 1894, Milo ami Capuna engoged in
a game oi cards at 426 Green street, San
Francisco.
Before playing longCapuna accused the
lover of ctieating and a row ensued. In
the heat of passion Felice referred to the
old man's daughter, which aroused' his
most violent anger.
The dispute ended in Felice stabbing
Capuna in the back with a stiletto. Felice
made his escape and is supposed to have
left the country.
Captain Ltes and his men made every
effort to hnd him, but no trace was ever
had ol the fugitive. His relatives claim
that he is in Buenos Ayres, but his part
ner believes that he returned to his native
country.
''Yes, we received a threatening letter,"
said Mrs. Ghiglione to-day, "and at once
turned it over to the polics, who have en
deavored to Keep it quiet. Of course we
are afra:d, because we do not know what
may happen. I believe Felice is in Italy,
but we are not even safe with him there.
The San Francisco police claim to have
located him, but of course it is impossible
to tell whether they have the right man or
not. 1 hope we will not get any more such
letters."

BERKELEY NEWS NOTES.
A Grocery Complication â Disgusted
fcunday Sportsâ Appointment of
Fire Chief of the Council.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 24 â C. Deme
trak, merchant, journalist, footr.ee en
thusiast and inventor of airships, is a
much-wanted man in Berkeley. As
stated in a recent issue of The Call,
Bemetrak left Berkeley two weeks a^o,
under a cloud of mystery, and has not
been seen in Berkeley since. He sold out
his grocery business at the corner of Shat
tuck and University avenues a short time
ago to George Fnndus, one of his clerks.
Three days after the transfer the stock
was attached by San Francisco creditors,
and a Sheriff's lock was placed on the
door. l"'undus claims that the Sheriff has
no right to attach the stocu, because it be
longs to him and not to Demetrak, and
because he purchased it in good faith and
was not aware that there were any out
standing debts. Accordingly he has sued
the Sheriff for $3000 to cover his loss of
stock, hauled away, and alleged damages
sustained.
May Choose the Chief.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 24.â The Town
Board will hold a meeting to-morrow
evening, at which several matters of im
portance will come up for consideration.
One will be the appointment of a fire
chief for the town. The four corners of
Berkeley will be represented with candi
i dates for the place. The East End is
j urging the name of James Kenny and the
! West End that of Sam H. B'orkheim.
i North Berkeley is putting forward the
i name of A. L Ott, and South Berkeley is
desirous that D. J. Keane shall be at the
head of the fire laddies. Tbe fight seems
to lie bi'tween Kenny and Borkheim.
The committee on the lone-standing
i Unda liquor case, consisting of Trustees
Cripps md Hoff, will make a report as to
whethe." or not Unda violated the license
ordinance as charged by Marshal Lloyd.
Wanted Their Money Back.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 24.â Fifty or
more tired, weary and disgusted admirers
of tne manly art came out from the gym
nasium of the West Berkeley Athletic
Club lafit night wishing that their dollar
pieces were in their purses, A. hot prize
' ring contest between Jack Davis of Omaha
I and "Nflgro" Brown of San Francisco for
i a $35 trophy was advertised to take place
at thi club quarters. It did take
place, but the men put so little spirit into
their work, and fought at such long dis
tance, that the crowd set up a yell at the
close and shouted "fake!" "fake!" and
demanded ttie return of their admission
fee. They didn't get it.
The "go" waÂ» to be for ten rounds. Pre
liminary to it was a three-round sparring
match between Frank McNamara and
Jack Egan, without a decision. In the
other bout, Davis was given the decision
on points.
Their Initiatory Work.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 24.â As an in
j trodnction to their season of training for
the intercollegiate track and field meet
this spring, the Berkeley track team,
which is composed of forty sprinters,
hurdlers, jumpers, vaulters, riders and
weicht men, will take a crosscountry run
to-morrow afternoon. This form of exer
cise promises to be a feature of this sea
son's work. But little of this particular
kind of training, so common in the East,
has been practiced at Berkeley. A score
or more of other young collegians, who
deslra exercise, will join the athletes in
their jaunt.
Chorafstry Building Addition.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 24 âA proposi
tion is being considered by the Board of
University Regents to add another story
to the Chemistry building, which shall be
given over to the use of the department
of biology. The present quarters of the
chemists and biologists are considered
wholly inadequate. It has been found
that to build another story will be cheaper
than to construct an annex with equally
as much room.

Chancsllor Yorke Speaks Warmly on
the Duty of Catholics Regard
icg Literature.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 24. )
The announcement that Rev. Father
Yorke would preach from the theme,
"Catholic Literature," caused a larger
crowd to assemble this morning than
capacious St. Francis de Sales' Church
could accommodate.
' There was special music and an aug
mented choir. The Chancellor's sermon
was preceded by high mass.
Father Yorke opened by referring to the
Catholic church as a great missionary
organization, and then proceeded to show
how the greatest ally to missionary work
is the press, and how it carried to hun
dreds of thousands of people all manner
of information that they could not pos
sibly obtain by any other means.
"On the Eastern seaboard a very poor
opinion exists of the Western newspa
pers," said the preacher. "This is not the
fault of the publishers, who supply the
public with just what is in demand. If
you will purchase filth, it will be supplied
to you. If you ask a grocer for a brand of
tea and he does not give it to you, of
course you go elsewhere. You mast do
the same with your papers.
"Which of you, if he went home and
found an intelligent man at your fireside
teliing your wife and little ones of all
those abominable things and experiences
in the slums of which Christian people do
not even speak, would not instantly throw
him out? Yet you subscribe for the daily
press that is dome just the same thing.
"Not content with ustne all the diction
that intelligence can desire and throwing
around the nauseous details the glamour of
reality until the reader actually seems to
be going through the same experience art
has been prostituted to carry out the base
design, and large pictures of things which
should be avoided as poison are printed to
the pollution of the children's minds and
the damning of t&eir souls.
â¢â¢Mothers' broken hearts are grieving to
day in thousands of instances because of
wayward sons and daughters who drew
their tirst inspiration of crime from the
filthy daily newspaper.
"The antidote is with yourselves. Re
fuse to purchase such trash and it will
soon be withdrawn from the market."

Section and Military Records
Across the Bay.
The riflemen who failed to go to the
Shell Mound rifle range yesterday missed
a fine opportunity for making good scores.
In the forenoon the appearance of a few
clouds in the sky kept many good shots
at home, but those who went across the
bay were amply repaid for their pains, for
the sun came out and atmosphere and
light were ali that could be desired.
Several of the German sharpshooting
clubs were booked for their regular con
tests, but deaths in their societies prevent
ed them from attending to their reeular
sport. However, there was no lack of
noise on the range. The rattle of muskets
fine rifles and smaller arms was heard all
day.
The members of the Columbia Pistol
and Rifle Club held their regular fourth-
Sunday shoot. Several new faces were
seen in their midst â enthusiasts who have
recently become members. Dr. J. J.
Giusti has recently turned his attention
to revolver shooting. He used that
weapon while in the militia, but lately
I:a3 not had a chance to do much practic
ing. He promises to be a regular attend
ant at the Columbia's shoots hereafter.
Victor La Jlott, who is connec.ed with
the State Board of Trade, promises to be a
tine nfie shot. Heretofore he has done
excellent work in the field, but the set
triggers and globe and peep sights stag
gered him for a while.
Charles Burrell of the Arcata Rifle Club
was a guest of the Columbia Club, aim
was greatly interested in the performances.
He says that the Humboldt County club
is in fine condition.
The regularevents were decidedly inter
esting and many excellent scores were
made in the several matches. Early in the
day there was a spirited competition for
the honor of being high man for the Bush
nell medal. Every month the man with
the be^t score has bis name inscribed as a
mark of honor on the medal. The ten best
scores of the year will finally win this val
uable trophy. A. H. Pape led with a hold
cver nine in three shots, Columbia
target, from the laÂ«t contest. No one
ruade a better score yesterday, though F.
O. Young and Dr. L. O. Rodgers crowded
him well.
The same kind of a contest was on in the
Blunding pistol iratch, whicn. is governed
by identical condit.ons. Young's name
will be put on that medal for this month.
The club has developed a new musket
shot. He is J. E. Gorman who, hereto
fore has paid much attention to pistol
practice, and has now taken to the mus
ket. His first score on tne Glindemann
medal yesterday was a forty-eight Creed
moor count, and Gorman is now looking
around for a good military musket. F.
H. Bushnell, H. J. Wicker and Frank
Mason are also among the new aspirants
for military shooting honors.
On the 50-yard ran^e there was some
very speedy contests and the revolver
shots are coming to the front in good
shape. This match promises to be a de
cided feature in this year'- programme.
The records on the 200 and 50-yard
ranges were as follows:

DANCING IN THE PULPIT.
Key. Mr. Ford Justifies It to Attract
Sinners.
"Under the Bushels" was the title of
the sermon delivered by Rev. Frink L.
Ford at the First Christian Church last
evening. He said:
"What is the matter with the Christian
church r 1 feople don't Know about our
church. If we want a large harvest we
must have a large planting.
"We have the whole world to sow in
and, although man made precepts, we
have no use for them.
"Let us go back to Jerusalem ana study
the mind of our Master, lie taught the
truth ti;at was for ail mankind. If it were
in my power to act tho fool, I would do
I so, if in that way I couhi attract neojjie to
listen to the gospel. People have encour
aged me, saying: 'Brother Ford, do right
and we will stand by you."
"A minister of God," he said, "has a
perfect right to dance, act, play a farce in
his pulpit, if, by 'Joing so, he can attract
people to come and hear the gospel in all
its i-iifiiy and simplicity. People say
to me that they have just
heard of our church, and think our
doctrine is ne*. Brethren, what do you
think of that? We are not a new
church; we are 1900 years old.
Jesus said, 'Go preach.' He did not i
say to preach in a certain kind of way, or I
in a certain church, or in a certain puipil ;
so we have a ri^ht to depart a little out of
the ordinary to attract people to us. There :
is a divine duly put upon us to draw peo- !
pie to our churches, and we must do it."
ROMANISM AND LIBERTY
The Rev. Victor M. Ruthven
Denounces Catholic
Teachers.
He Says They Are Enemies of the
Public Schools and Slaves
of the Pops
Rev. Victor M. Ruthven, who say 3
he was once an ordained Catholic priest,
lectured at Metropolitan Temple to a
large audience yesterday afternoon on
"Rome and the Public Schools."
The speaker devoted considerable of his
introduction to a discussion of Father
Yorke. He case some reflections on him
and the ladies who have been distributing
anti-Ruthven tracts at the door of the
Temple during the meetings.
Coming to the subject of the lecture the
speaker said: "The conflict in regard to
the public schools was begun by a Jesuit
father, Theodore Metcalf of Boston, in
1808. He denounced the public schools
and called them a National fraud."
The speater quoted a number of Catho
lic authorities to Bhow that they object to
the public schools, saying: "Pope Pius
the IX denounced any system of instruc
tion Dot under control of the church.
Others have called the public schools a
scandal and disgrace. Bishop Gilmore of
Cleveland said he â would refuse the sacra
ments of the church to those who sent
their children to the public schools."
The speaker argued that, "if the Irish
could be divorced from their insane at
tachment to Catholicism tiiey might be
come leaders of men, but under the church
teachings, which place the catechism
ahead of all other instruction, they must
remain a backward and a down-trodden
people."
The lecturer quoted from what he Â«aid
was a modern Catholic catechism, many
of the sentences from which taught that
Christians are all doomed to damnation.
"This is the thing," he said, "which they
want to leach in the public schools. If
their hatred of American institutions can
not be eradicated the day will come when
they will have to be disfranchised. They
cannot be true to the Pope and to the ilag
at one time."

A YEAR OF WORK
FOR YOUNG MEN
Forty-fourth Anniversary
of the Christian
Association.
Bishop Newman's Address to
Those at the Annual
Meeting.
V. Has Been a Hard Y?ar, but Not
Without Redeeming
Features.
"Nothing is done without consecrated
power of the individual man or woman,
and that power is given to us by Jesus
Christ."
Such were the words addressed by
Bishop Newman to the people that had
assembled in the Young Men's Christian
Association Auditorium on Mason and
Ellis streets yesterday afternoon. The
occasion was the association's forty-fourth
anniversary, and was fitly celebrated by
the young men of the institution.
A cordial invitation had been issued to
their many friends, and many responded.
The secretary made a brief statement of
the financial condition of the association,
and then Rev. John P. Newman came
forward. He was introduced by Rolla V.
Watt.
Bishop Newman spoke feelingly of the
consecration of lives, impressing upon his
audience that the time will and must
come when Christianity will supersede all
otheT forms of worsnip; when all forms of
government will recognize the brother
hood of man and Jesus Christ shall be
recognized as the all-sufficient Savior of
mankind.
When each household sha'.l be a church,
the father a priest, the mother a priestess
and the sous and daughters the wor
shipers. Whether the time will come
when sin shall cease it was not, the
Bishop said, for him to assert, but the
time will come when every knee
shall bend and every tongue shall confess
that Jesus Christ is over all.
Those occupying seats on the stage with
Bishop Newman were: Rev. W. H7 More
land, Rev. J. L. Dietz, Rev. E. R. Dille,
Rev. William Rader, Irving M. Scott,
E. E. Ewing. J. J- Pfister, C. A. Maydwell,
Samuel Foster, H. J. McCoy, Dr. Rigdon
and J. T. Web3ter.
The past twelve months have been
among the most trying and yet most re
markable in the annals of the Y. M. C. A.
The management has encountered many
difficulties, but the year was not without
some encouragement ana che?r.
Although still confronted with a large
indebtedness and much more that is dis
couraeing, the coming year the associa
tion will strain every effort to keep their
work within the current income and pre
vent the debt from increasing, and even
to reduce it if possible.
Notwithstanding the obstacles which at
times seemed almost insurmountable a
commendable work has been carried for
ward and thousands of young men have
found the association building to be a
haven of refuge in the hour of need ana
temptation.
SAYS HE IS ORTHODOX.
Rev. William Rader Ascribes the
Criticism of Him to a Misun
derstanding.
Rev. William Rader, the pastor of the
Third Congregational Church ot this City,
denies that there is anything unorthodox
in the views which he has been expressing
in a series of Sunday evening lectures on
the Bible. One lecture in particular was
recently criticized by a religious organ as
containing sentiments opposed to the
belief of the great body of the Presby
terian, Baptist and Methodist churches,
and for this reason it was urpea that he
should be removed from the '97 commit
tee of the Christian Endeavorers, of which
Mr. Rader has been an active member.
"I have heard no criticism of my views
from any of the clergy or of the laity, ex
cept friendly differences of opinion on
minor points," said Mr. Rader last even
ing, "and I was much surprised at the
article suggesting that I be removed from
the '97 committee. I feel confident that
the writer of that article misapprehended
my views. He staves that I denied the
decalogue was divinely inspired. I do
not think I said anything of the kind. He
also states that I am a follower of Howi
son in my belief concerning miracles. I
am not a follower of Howison or any
other man.
"What will come of bis suggestion I do
not know. I have very much at heart the
work of the Christian Endeavor Society,
and my relations with it are very close. I
may feel called upon to make a statement
later, but I feel now that the matter is all
owing to a mistake."
Mr. Rader preached last evening on
"The Boot of Jonah." He declared that
he mad-> no attempt to decide as to its
literal history. He believed in the in
spiration of its truth, and believed in the
medium of certain revelations of God.
"My Bible does not rise or fall with the
literal event of the whale swallowing
Jonah," he said.

NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
The wise men who were sent to Sacra
mento to make laws for the country seem
to be of the impression that if they cannot
find anything else to do, that it is their
bounden duty to alter the laws governing
the National Guard of the State. No
sooner do the members of the guard get
into a position to appreciate what one
Legislature wanted it to do before another
Legislature comes along and wants to
undo what the previous one did, and
wants to start anew. This constant tink
ering with the service will not tend to
raise the standard of the guard for the
reason that the officers lose interest and
the men cet disgusted and do not care to
devote the attention they otherwise would
to duty, for they say "What we learn to
day we may have 10 unlearn to-morrow."
If the law-makers are anxious to render
the guard a service they can do it by let
ting it a!one.
The introduction last week of a bill hav
ing for its purpose the transforming of the
First Regiment, Second Brigade, into an
artilJery regiment has created a great stir
in the First. This bill is not the one that
vtas presented by one directly interested
in us affairs, but was introduced by Senator
Pediar from the southern part of the State.
It is possible that the Senator has kindly
lathered the bill for some one, who, at
this time, does not wish to come forward
and De sponsor for it. Within two weeks
Adjutant-General Barrett was in this City
and he was strongly opposed to any talk
of transforming the First into an artillery
regiment, but it is stated that within a
few days he has changed and is now in
favor of the project. It is strongly sur
mised that Major-General James is inter
ested in the movement to mate a change.
Wiiat may be the purpose in view is
not Known at this time, but ii it should be
made it will involve an expense which it
is believed the guard cannot at this time
stand. If it is merely to instruct the men
in artillery tactics they can learn those
just as well when wearing white stripes
as when wearing red ones. There have
been occasions in the regular army when
the infantry was forced to familiarize it
selfwith cavalry tactics and do cavalry
duty. When such occasions presented
themselves the officers did not wait for
orders to change the color of the stripes,
but utilized the men of their respective
commands and converted them into
"mounted infantry," notably in Gen
eral Miles' Indian campaign.
Some time ago, as appears from the
adjutant's latest rep jrt, there was a de
cided expression of opinion by tha heads
of the guard, including the commander
in-chief, Governor Budd, and the adju
tant-general, that there should be no ar
tihery regiment, and they expressed
themselves as well satisfied with the reor
ganization.
If those who are at the head of the guard
would let politics alone and pay more at
tention to the actual needs of the guard
and see that the men are instructed in
the duties of the soldier they would do
much to advance the standard of the offi
ce, sand men. The guard needs lyceums
for officers and men that they may become
familiar with all that is expected of a sol
dier, and the instructions given in each
iyceurn should be perfectly the same so
that the guard in every part of the State
would be in a position to act uniformly.
There should also be lyceums for the com
missioned and non-com missioned officers
so that each might have an opportunity
to have his dunes clearly denned and
not let every individual place his own con
struction on what he considers he should
do. Regulations looking to more uni
formity in the rank and file would be of
much more service than all the political
wire-palling that could be done in three
years.
Major Fred S. Pott, aid-de-camp, di
vision staff ba3 been recommended for
promotion as lieutenant-colonel and
division paymaster vice Lieutenant
Colonel Fred F. Foliis deceased.
The National Guard will be turned out on
Washington's birthday. The First Regi
ment, Second Brigade, will on that day
have a held day. There will, it is the
idea now, be a parade, and march to some
point, where there will be a regimental
drill and possibly firing at silhouette tar
gets and men on the field.
The resignation 01 Colonel Macdonald
of the First Regiment Infantry, Second
Brigade, has been officially announced,
and that of Captain Board man of the
Signal Corps, Second Brigade, nas also
been announced, and both have been ac
cepted. Now it remains for orders to be
issued for the elections.
Colonel Macdnnsld in his letter asking
to be placed on tne retired list asks that
he may be retired as coionel of the Second
Artillery, and not as coionel of the First
Infantry, which command he helu at the
time he resigned. This is looked upon by
guardsmen as a very singular move, but
there is no one who can explain it and the
colonel is out of the State, therefore he
cannot be asked for his reasons.
The Fifth Regiment of Infantry, Second
Brigade, has issued a challenge to The
First Regiment infantry, same brigade,
to snoot a match with rifles, 100 men, ten
shots each. The Fifth is waiting to hear
from the First. The arrangement ot de- i
tails has been left to Lieutenant Heller,
I. R. P., Fifth Regiment.
The celebration that is to be held in
honor of the victory of the rifle team of
the First Regiment Infamy, Second Bri
gade, over the Hawaiian team will in all
probability occur in March.
A committee composed of the lieuten
ants of the several companies of the First
Regiment Infantry, Second Brigade, and
the junior majors of the regiment have
now in charge a plan to organize athletic
sports for the men. It is proposed to
follow the plan that is in operation in the
City of New York and have field days at
different times in the year, an.t, in time,
to organize teams to enter into friendly
contests with the soldiers stationed at the
Presidio. The committee will meet shortly
to arrange details.
For a time it was supposed that Lieu
tenant-Colonel Duboce would not have an
opponent for the vacant colonelcy of the
First Regiment, of which he has been yir
tuallv in command since the reorganiza
tion, but Maior Adolph Huoer, on the re
tired list, has come forward as a caadidate
for the position. The indications are that
he is not in it with his stronger opponent.
At the meeting of the board of officers of
the .fifth Regiment Infantry, Second
Brigade, it was decided that at camps in
future there should be company mess in
stead of a caterer as in tne past. The
several companies will draw their rations
from the commissary and the men will
cook their food "just as is done in the
regular army." There were issued orders
to ascertain* the cost of a certain camp
oven and utensils for companies of
seventy-five men each.
The matter of drills for the year was
discussed and instruction in relation
thereto for the year were issued. Colonel
Fairbanks is very anxious that the men
of his command shall be as proficient as
possible, and to that end he devotes a
great deal of time and personal attention
to Have the men prppeny instructed.
The I bird Brigade.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 21.â 1n a military
sen>e Fresno is one of the moÂ«t important
cities in California, as the headquarters ot
the Third Brigade are located here, with
Brigadier-General Muller commanding.
The Third Brigade consists of the Second,
Sixth ami Eighth infantry regiments.
General Muller's Btaff, located in Fresno,
are: T. J. Hay, colonel and as-istaut
adjutant-general ; Dr. A. J. Pedlar,
colonel and brigade surgeon; Captains
George A. Miller and Nick Kittle, aids
de-camp.
The Sixth Infantry Regiment com
prises the companies in the San Joaquin
Valley. The regimental headquarters are
at Stockton, Colonel J. J. JNanan com
manding. The Sixth Infantry is divided
into the Ninth and Tenth the
headquarters of both being in Fresno.
Lieutenant-Colonel S. S. Wrieht of this
city is in command of the Ninth, and
Mujor Colin Chisholm of the Tenth. It
will therefore be seen that Fresno is well
to the fore in military circles.
Of the two local companies Company F
is in command of Captain George W.
Jones, and Company C in command of
Captain George O.Duncan. E ich com
pany has a membeiship of about sixty
well-drilled men. The regular weekiy
drills of Company C take place on Tues
day evenings, and those of Company F on
Thursday evenings. Once a month the
two companies drill together in battalion
movements under command of Major
Chisholm or Colonel Wright Advantage
is taken of moonlight nights, and the bat
talion drills are held in the streets.
Much interest is taken in target prac
tice and the two companies are fast com
ing to the front as marksmen. They have
made a great improvement durine the
past year and several excellent scores are
made at every shoot.
The quarters for the two companies in
Armory Hall are comfortably fitted up,
probably as weil as any armory in the
State. The officers' rooms adjoin those of
the companies and are well furnished.
The guardsmen Lave been ta>knig of
giving a number of socials and dances
during the winter, but so far none have
materialized. Company Cis preparing to
give a grand ball at the armory on Feb
ruary 22.
The Sixth Regiment.
MERCED, Cal., Jan. 22.â Captain Gra
ham received a deserved compliment in
General Orders No. 1, is ued from the
headquarters ol the Third Brigade, where
he r.as mentioned as one of the two com
pany commanders in the brigade who
forwarded reports on the emergency call
of last November. Captain Graham is a
careful and painstaking officer and has
the routiue work of his office well sys
tematized.
One of the Stockton papers contained a
rumor last week that the Sixth Regiment
would encamp for this year's tour of duty
at Wawona. The statemeut is considered
by memb rs of Company H to be a mere
rumor.
Wawona would undoubtedly be a de
lightful spot for an encampment, but its
selection would be unfortunate, as it
would consume a great part of the ten
days in ftoinu and coming, and its isolated
locality would make it a very expensive
selection. The boys here hope that the
rumor is unfounded, as they want to get
all the benefit possible out of the few days
they will spend in camD and -want to see
it conducted as cheaply as possible.
The company clerk has decorated his
office with v varied assortment of calen
dars, large, small, plain and ornamental.
He requests the correspondent lo say that
he wouid thankfully receive any that
might be donated and will tenderly and
carefully tack tuem on the wall, where
there is yet room for a few more.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 25, 1897.
STILL DIFFER ON
SCHOOL DEFICITS
One Director Figures a Sur
plus and Another a
Shortage.
Waller Insists That Schools
Must Close or Salaries
Be Cut Off.
Hawley Again Mak s Figures Show
in; That tee New Board
Claims Too Much-
Charles H. Hawley, ex-School Director,
makes reply to the statement of School
Director Waller concerning a deficit in
the school fund and the possible necessity
of asking the teachers to wait for the last
month's salary or closing the schools one
month short of the usual time.
Mr. Waller is the chairman of the
Finance Committee of the present School
Board and Mr. Hawley was chairman of
the same committee of the previous board.
Mr. Hawley said yesterday: "The trou
ble with Mr. Walier's position is that he
claims the present board ought to have
the entire State appropriation. When the
board of which I was a member went into
office practically the same condition of
finances confronted us that confronts the
present board. The last half of the total
amount due from the State is not avail
able till about June 8, alter the close of
the fiscal year. Let the teachers go on
and wait for their last month's pay, or
when the money comes in in June it can
be tola whether any decrease is necessary.
It is impossible for anybody to tell the ex
act amount of money that will come from
the State. I do not think it is necessary
to close the schools at all."
Mr. Hawley 's statement is as follows:
It seems to be the aim of Director Waller, as
far as the finances of ih>: School Department
are concerned, to figure on a supposed deficit
(which may or may not exist at the ciose of
th- fiscal year) and make it as large as possi
ble, instead of looking en the bright s-ide of
the question.
During the fiscal year 1895-96 the last
DOMrd, aiter receiv.ng the tipuropiiation of
$1,000,000 from the Supervisors, were con
fronted with the name question of a supposed
deficit thai might exist at the end of the fiscal
year. Instead of giving the press column
after column of information day after day
about a .supposed deficit that mignt exist, we
did, when necessary, withhold a portion of
the teachers' salaries, and at the close of the
fiscal year, after paying the teachers ;hÂ»ir
back salary, had a t-urplus of $41,277 25,
which was accomplished without consul ting
the pre~s.
Now as to a few of Director Waller's criti
cisms on my report:
My figures, as given for publication yester
day, are absolutely correct, and agree wiih
Mr. Waller's statement as far as the receipt of
$420,118 63 from the City is concerned; but
the first installment of $413,694 72 from the
State fund Mr. Waller wants to credit to the
new board, which would mean that the old
board, for the last six months of the year,
were not entitled to any money from the
State, but that the new board should have the
entire $630,000 or more, received from this
fund. If >o the receipts of the old boarrt for
the last six months would be $420,118 63,
and as the supervisors appropriated $1,200,
--000 for the year, Mr. Waller would have
$780,000 to run the department the remain
der of the fiscal year.
The first installment from the State is due
December 31, 1896. It is the receipts from
State taxes received from July 1 to December
31 of each year, anil as it lakes the State Con
troller several days to close accounts with the
cities und counties of the State it is impossible
to receive it on or beiore January 10 of the
following year and it is a; ways included in
the receipts of the school fund of the previous
six months.
Iv speaking of a deficit I have always spoken
of it as occurring at the cud of the fiscal year,
if at all, as that is the only time it can occur
alter the receipts for the entire year have
been received.
According to Mr. Waller's statement the new
board ie expected to run the department on
$199,000 (i;i six months), the surplus left by
the old board.
T" the surplus of $199,000 left January 1,
1897, must be added tne income for six
months for rents, ;rom the second installment
01 taxes, mid from the second installment
from the Stat-; turn], which will probably
amount in all from $020,000 to $650,000, and
from that sum must L>e deducted the bnlance
of $143,000 to become due on the Mission
High School contracts, leaving tho pre-ent
board a probable sum ranging from $480,000
to $510,000 or more for tne balance of the
year.
For Mr. Waller's special benefit I wish to
say that if at the close of the term of office of
the present board he does not include the first
installment oi taxes received irom the State
fund in his receipts, the board will retire with
a large shortage.
In conclusion, I wish to state emphatically
that my report on the school fund upon my
retirement from office simply showed the con
dition of the fund at mat time, and did not
enter into any question of a deficit which
might occur at the ciose of the present fiscal
year.
Director Waller said last evening: "Mr.
Hawley's figures look all right, but they
are not a business man's figures. They
do not show the facts as they do exist and
will exist at the end of the fiscal year. As
he say-, we have $199,000. We havd* more
than that â $250.000â 0ut that will not
carry us through. Any way it can be fig
ured we will have a deficit Juno 1 of about
$90,000, including the teachers' salaries for
the half month of November. The State
tax^s are an unKnown quantity. I think
it will be necessary to reduce or cut off
salaries or close the schools. By doing
a*ay with special teachers and substitutes
and practicing tlie greatest . economy in
several directions I think we can save
about. $20,000 and puil through with a
small margin."
BIG rOOTBALL CONTEST.
Chicago Champion* May Come to Con
test With the Gaels.
Some of the members of the four foot
ball clubs that compose the Gaelic Foot
ball Association bad an informal meet
ing at the ball grounds at Golden Gate
Park yesterday for the purpose of discuss
ing plans for selecting a team from the
four clubs to so into training to meet a
crack team from Chicago, which has pro
posed to come here and spend a week
some time during the next summer.
The four clubs here which compose the
Gaelic Association are the Emmets, the
Parnells, the Celtics and the San Fran
ciscos.
The captain of the Celtic Club of Chicago
has written to the clubs here to inquire if
they will arrange for a contest for suprem
acy 011 or about the 4th of July next.
Captain Fred Palmer of the Emmets
and Captain A. Mclnery of the San Fran
ciscos think that a team can be selected
from the men of the Gaelic Association
here thai will either beat the Chicago
champions or come so near it that the
Chicagoans will know they have been in a
football came.
There will probably be four exhibition
games given by the Gaelic men before the
contest with Chicago.
The meeting on the ball ground yester
day was to practice and consult about the
matter informally. A regularly called
meeting to make final arrangements will
be- held later.
The Power of Thought.
Mrs. Mary A. Wells lectured last night be
fore the Theosophical Society in Native Sons'
Hall, her subject being, "The Power of
Thought and Its Relation to Humanity." The
speaker maintained that the ideas of Balzac
are correct; that thought is a natural force in
nature, like electricity, and that will controls
it. The lecture brought out mnny questions
which the speaker answered according to her
theories.

GREEKS WHO WILL
AID THE CUBANS
A. Company of Volunteers
Now Being Formed
in This City.
Prominent Business Men Taking
an Active Interest in the
; Movement.
At Least Eighty Sharpshooters Will
Leave for Cuba Inside of
a Month.
The Greeks of California have decided
to take a hand in the struggle now going
on for independence in Cuba, and should
tbe hopes ot the leaders be realized at
least eighty men, old soldiers who fought
and bled in the battie-rielas of Europe,
wiil sail from some port in California dur
ing the first week in February.
Among those who are said to know some
thing about the movement are E. Stath
opulos, J. Catechi, R. Radovich, P. Car
voones, A. Capilos and D. G. Camarinos.
Should the company be formed a well
known member of one of the Schuetzen
vereins will go as captain, and he will ?ee
to it that none but sharpshooters are mem
bers of the organization.
An option on a smart schooner that is
now on the Atlantic side has been secured
and should all go weli eighty of the men
whose ancestors made the walls of Spar
ta will be righting for Cuba within a
month.
Rudovich is the head of the movement
and it anybody can engineer it to success
he is the man. The people connected
with him have considerable money at
their disposal, and the first thing known
about the movement will be the landing of
the men in Cuba.
Staiuopulos, Catechi, Radovich, Oama
riuos, Capilos and C'arvoones ail assert
that there is nothing in the story and as
sert that the men now in training are be
ing got ready for the nucleus of a com
pany that is to be ">imilar to one of tho
German Schuetzen clues. All the mem
bers of the orHanization are single men,
however, and each one has his grip
packed and is ready to leave for New Or
leans at a moment's notice.

THE ROBINS RETURN.
Handsome New Water Colors Adorn the
Walls of the Museum â Sunday
at the Cliff.
The warm, bright day caused crowds to
seek outdoor pleasure at the park and the
ocean beach yesterday. The Cliff House
had an unusual number of visitors. The
crowd watched the waves which were roll
ing pretty high. A lone little rowjboat,
which was out on the billows, seemed to
be having a rather rocky time.
At the park the area in front of the mv-
Fie stand was packed with handsome
equipages, and along the driveways a large
number of tine horses and bicyclers were
swiftly speeding. Tne boys playing ball
ii: ilit- valley took up all the available
space, and thoroughly enjoyed the extra
Mne weather.
The robins came back to the park from
tne mountains the other day to seek shel
ter in their safe home there. Superintend
ent McLaren says this is a sure sum of
storm and snow: threatening the mountain
haunts of the redbreasts.
The cleaning out of Stow Lake has
been completed, and the water was turned
into it yesterday. New scales are to be
put in at the park entrance in order to
carefully check tiie weights of the sup
plies purchased for park use.
At the Sutro Baths much amusement
wa s caused by the antics of the aquatic
clowns, Cornell and Empey. In the 100
yard race H. F. Brewer wa^ first and D.
A. Carroll second. In the 50-yard race P.
Geddis made a tie with Redican.
In the open-to-all obstacle race the con
testants had to swim through six pools and
climb over five barriers. Only D. A. Car
roll and F. Bell kept up the smuggle to
the goal. Can oil was hist.
At the Chutes the scenic railway has
been lengthened to 4000 yards. A week
from to-day the Chutes will be opened
every afternoon and evening- as well as on
Sundays. The principal attractions yes
terday afternoon were Ordway, the trick
bicycle rider, and a balloon ascension. A
new stace is being erected where free
shows are to be given.
Tne Park Museum has been enriched
duriner the last week by the addition of
sixty original paintines in water color of
rare animals, reptiles and birds, by the
celebrated artist, .Professor W. Harring of
London. This splendid collection is the
generous gift ot John L. Bardweli. The
museum has also received valuable dona
tions from Rev. S. H. Willey, Mrs. S. J.
Howard and Mi?s Lensard B. Hanbrick,
all of San Francisco.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 25, 1897.
J. H. MANGELS, a Member of the Firm of Tillmann & BendeL
Who Dkd Yesterday.
THEY WILL HELP
THE LEAGUE ON
Prominent Catholics Or
ganize an Auxiliary
Society.
At the First Meeting a Hand
some Sum Is Quickly
Subscribed.
Members Will Contribute Yearly to
Support the T mperance Or
ganization in I s Work.
Tho League of the Cross will continue
to carry on its great work in the cause of
temperance with renewed vigor and if pos
sible more enthusiasm than in the past.
Indeed, its future is now assured and still
greater progress may be expected in years
to come, for yesterday the most substan
tial kind of encouragement was given the
leading spirits in this movement.
An auxiliary society was oreanized un
der tbe patronace of his grace, Arcn
bishop Rjordan, and at his express desire.
The large exhibition hall of Sacred Heart
Coilege,cornerof Larkin and Eday streets,
was well tilled with leading Catholic gen
tlemen and ladies of San Francisco, and
then and there the League of the Cross
Auxiliary was instituted under circum
stances that are regarded as especially
auspicious. They were gathered together
in response to a circular letter from the
Archbishop, published a week since, in
which the sentiments of the writer were
expressed as follows:
The League of the Cross has now been in ex
istence la our City for six years, ana the good
work which it has accomplished in training
our boys to habits of temperance is manifest
to all. Realizing the great dangers to which
our youth are exposed, I saw the necessity tor
this organization and I have watched its suc
cess with admiration. It has banded the boys
together, and by its frequent meetings, lec
tures, essays and other exercises, has made
them interested in the work of temperance
and has taught them the blessings of a sober
life. The league has accomplished all its
work without any regular fund to defray its
expenses. It has had to rely on the generosity
of private individuals for its supi-ort. The
time has come, however, when it snould have
a regular fund. lam confident that there are
numerous persons who are only too willing to
contribute a small sum annually towards this
good cause.
Among those present were: Rev. J. J.
Prendemast, V. G. ; Rev. P. R. Lynch ;
Rev. H. H. Wyman, C. R. P.; Rev. P.
O'Ryan, Rev. P. C. Yorke, Rev. P. S.
Casey, Rev. P. Scanlan, Rev. Jobn Cul
len, Thomas H. Fallon, Jarneb J. Giidea,
William P. Sullivan, A. B. Maguire. James
R. Kelly, A. H. Loughborough, Dr. Gib
bon, Thomas J. Welsh, Charles Ga-rtn, T.
P. Riordan, George Maxwell, James Dug
pan, Michael Flood, J. C. Nealon, Colonel
J. G. Giestine and Dr. Cunningham.
Tne Rev. Peier C. Yorke presided in the
absence of the Archbishop. In opening
the meeting he briefly stated its objects,
as previously announced in the call for
such a gathering, and he read the follow
ing letter from Archbishop Riordan :
St. Mary's Cathedral, i
1100 Franklin street, Sail Francisco. {
Reverend Father Yorke: Owing 10 a very se
vere attack of the grippe I shall not be able to
attend the meeting called for this afternoon
in the bull of Sacred lit art College, and I ask
you to take my place and explain to the gen
tlemen who attend the object of it, which is
as follows: namely, the organization of an
auxiliary branch whose rmmbers will bind
themselves to aid by their influence and by a
small annual contribution the great work
which is being accomplished for our boys by
the society known as the League of the Cross.
1 wish you would explain to those wh<> at
tend the meeting how at present about 7000
boys are enrolled in the organization, and
each year brings a considerable increase of
membership; that the object iB to keep these
boys until they have reached the age of 21
years under sucn restraint and discipline that
habits of temperance may be contracted, with
the hope that during life they may be con
tinued.
I wish you would explain to the meeting
that the years oi a man's life between 12 and
21 are the formative years of life, when good
or bad habits are contracted and a bent given
either for virtue or vice.
The gentlemen present will readily compre
hend that if we can bring thousands of our
boys to the years of manhood with habits of
Bobriety and with a love of it, with minds
fully open to the dangers of intemperance, we
shall have done an immense good for them
selves and for society.
Now, to effect this, the League of the Cross
needs assistance of a pecuniary character.
Halls have to be rented, literature procured
and many other things done for the mainte
nance oi so large an organization. A tax can
not be imposed on the boys; they have noth
ing to give, and even if they had it is better
not to impose it, as it would hamper the main
tenance and growth of the society.
It is, 'herefore, better to appeal to outsiders,
and I aii confident that a sufficient number
will be ft;uud who will aid so meritorious a
work. Two thousand dollars a year would
suffice for all present demands, and* if 400 or
500 gentlemen could be found to join the
auxiliary branch the annual tax ou each
would be very small, not less than .*"> a year.
The future of church and State depends in
training our children to receive, and whatever
we do therefore to make them intelligent and
virtuous will bear abundant fruit in their
maturer years and fit them to be devout
Christians aud honest, industrious and law
abiding citizens. I therefore from my heart
commend the good work to the meeting and
enroll myself as one of the members of the
auxiliary body. Sincerely yours,
P. W. Riordan.
Father Yorke related the remarkable
history of the League of thÂ« Cross, and I
spoke in glowing terms of its members.
He concluded by telling the meeting that
members of the auxiliary would be ex
pected to contribute not less than $o each
annually toward the support of the tem
perance society. A recess was taken to
allow those present to enroll themselves
as members, and incidentally ;o con
tribute various sums of money ranging
from $5 to $100 each. In a very short time
the ro.l was completed for the first day,
with the following names appended to it:

"I am very glad to be able to announce
I that one-fourth of the money required for
! the year's subscription," said Father
Yorke, "has been received at this meet
ing; and we have promises for $500, so
the balance of the $2000 needed to carry
on the work will not be hard to get. All
the money will come into the hands of
Father O'Ryan, who shail regularly make
reports of receipts and expenses. It is to
the interests ot the League of the Cross to
have a capable, reliable secretary to
collect yearly installments, and so save
the members the trouble of going to
j Father O Ryan with their subscriptions.
We can assure you that all the money
will be spent under the direct supervision
of the most reverend Archbishop, and
that it will be bpent for the best pur
poses."
Father Yorke thanked the meeting in
the name of the Arch bsshop and for the
league for taking such sincere interest in
the movement. The presence of such a
large number of people showed they were
really and truly interested in it
So in the name of all the boys, who in
this society may be trained in paths of
temperance to be good citizens, he again
gave thanks and took his Beat amid cor
aial applause.
T. J. Welsh moved that the representa
tives of the various parishes of i?an Fran
cisco give a vote of thanks to the execu
tive committee for carrying out this idea,
and the motion was carried unanimously.
Father O'Ryan extended thanks in re
sponse on behalf of the executive commit
tee of the league.
Father Yorke announced that an annual
requiem mass would be celebrated on
Memorial day for deceased members and
deceased friends of members of the league,
and on Father Mather's day for living
members of the league. After the usual
prayer the meeting aujourned.
PLUNGED TO HIS DEATH
Joseph Meehan Falls Three Sto
ries and Is Instantly
Killed.
He Was Trying to Close a Window
When the Shocking Accident
Occurred.
Joseph Meehan, a mere lad but 16 years
of age, met his death in a strange and
shocking manner at about 8 o'clock last
evening. He was attempting to ciose a
window through which chilly draughts
were creeping into a room occupied by
himself aud parents on the third floor of v
lodging-house at 444>Â£ Third street, when
he slipped and plunged out and down to
the stone pavement telow. He struck on
his head. His skull and neck were broken
and he was dead in an instant.
The boy was employed in a local factory
as a glass blower. Having to be at his post
early this morning, the deceased intended
retiring early and wa3 proceeding to do
so when he met with the fatal accident.
His father entered the room when he was
disrobing and noticing that tba upper
sash of a window under which the boy's
cot was located, waÂ« pulled down, sug
gested that it be closed in order to prevent
illness.
The boy kneeled on bis cot, which was
about even with the window-sill, and lift
ing the lower sash attempted to raise the
upper one. Suddeniy he lost his balance
and plunged from the window. His father
and mother heard his body strike the
ground and hurried, wild with grief, to
the sidewalk. There on tne pavement lay
their boy, a minute before an obedient,
contented lad, and now a corpse.
A crowd of people immediately congre
gated, and it was with difficulty that the
little body was covered to bide it from the
eyes of the curious. The Coroner's office
was notified, and Deputy Coroners Tyrrell
and Smith removed the remains to the
Morgue.
Tne parents were heartbroken over the
death of their son, and would not be com
forted.

SUDDEN DEATH
OF J. H. MANGELS
The Bursting of a Blood
Vessel Caused His
End.
Deceased Was a Member of the
Firm of Tillmann &
Bendel.
He Was Only 31, and Was Well
Known and Esteemed in Busi
ness Circles.
John Henry Mangels, one of San Fran
cisco's youngest and most respected busi
ness men, a member of the wholesale
firm of Tillmann <fc Hendel, and a native
son, died somewhat suddenly at 5 o'clock
yesterday morning at the residenc of his
stepmother, Mrs. Glaus Mangeis, 2518
Howard street.
The news of Mr. Mangels' totally unex
pected death at the early age of 31 years
and 8 months will come as a severe shock
to a wide circle of friends by whom he
was known and admired, both in com
mercial and private life.
Mr. Mangels apparently enjoyed excel
lent health until quite recentiv, and did
not cease to personally attend to his busi
ness duties until last Saturday, when his
symptoms became so alarming as to com
pel him to take to his bed. His illness is
said to have been dropsical in character,
and toward the end water in the lungs
made respiration difficult. Dr. John
Moss, who was at once called in, aiso
found, upon examination, that other in
ternal organs were seriously affected. A
faial termination, however, was hardly
anticipated, nor did the patient himself
seem conscious of his precarious condi
tion.
The effort involved in breathing must
have been too much for his rapidly wan
ing strength, and eventually caused the
rupture of a biood-vessei in the brain, death
ensuing soon afterward. He passed away
quietly and witnout any pain whatever,
in tne presence oi several relatives, in
cluding his uncle, Claus Spreckels, and his
cousin, ,1. D. Spreckeis, whose residence
adjoins that of Mrs. Mangels.
John Henry Mangels was born in San
Fruncisco and received a public school
education in this City. He became a
member of the tirni of Tiilmaun & Bendel
about six years ago, but waÂ» also privately
connected with many important business
enterprises.
He belonged to Stanford Parlor, N. S.
G. W., and was an active member of the
Olymp.c and Bohemian clubs and of the
I'acinc Yacht Club. He always displayed
a keen interest in the affairs of the Na
tional Guard of California, ranking as
major in that body and acting on the staff
of (ieneral James.
His popularity in all these walks of life
was deservedly great, and those who knew
him in either one or all of them will
deeply deplore his untimely demise in the
very prime of manhood. He was related
to the bpr^ckels family by virtue of his
father's union with a sister of Claus
Spreckels. Mr. Mangels Sr. died several
years ago. Deceased has two sisters liv
ing, one of whom is the wife of P. Till
maiin.
The funeral will take place to-morrow
afternoon from the German church of St.
MarÃ, corner of Gough and O'Farrell
streets.
THE HANDBALL COURTS.
J. C. Nealon and 1. F. Bonnet Defeat
Champions J. Riordan and P. T.
Donnelly.
The Ban Francisco handball court was
crowded yesterday, and several attractive
games were witnessed. The greatest in
terest centered in a game in which J. C
Nealori and T. F. Bonnet played against
J. C. Riordan, the coast champion, and
P. T. Donnelly, amateur champion. The
game was marked by brilliant rallies and
splendid service.
Riordan and Donnelly strove hard to
avert defeat, as Nealon and Bonnet lowered
their colors a few weeks ago, but luck was
against them. Nealon was in great form,
and was keenly on the alert, never miss
ing a ball, while Bonnet played with his
usual skill and judgment. Donnelly has
been singularly unfortunate this year, but
he is not by any means discouraged.
â¢ Phil Ryan and Dan Rodeers did their
level best to defeat George McDonald and
W. Hamilton, but were unsuccessful,
much to their surprise. Ryan blamed
Rodeers and Kodgers blamed Ryan, and a
single-handed game will probably be the
result to determine the vexed question.
There were no games at the Union court
yesterday owing, probably, to the fact
that the court is uncovered.
Following were the games at the San
Francisco court:
M. Basch and R. Hausman defeated E.
Downs and T. Foley, 17â21, 21â15.
G. McDonald and W. Hamilton defeated P.
Ryan and 1). Rodgers, 21â12, 16â21, 21â19.
M. Edwards and M. McClure defeated W.
Stansbury and J. Collins, 21â14, 16â21,
21â19. M. Maguire and T. Luikin defeated J.
Hussey and G. Maguire, 2lâ l2, l4â 2l, 21â20.
T. Sullivan and DocMolloy defeated J. O'Don
nell and R. Shields, 21â11, 15â21. 21â18.
P. Barrett and J. O'Leary defeated H. Moflitt
and R. Shea, 21â 15-21,21â20. J.O'Don
holl and L. Hinze defeated J. Hinze and J.
Vogelsang, 21â14, 17â21, 21â19. E. Toy
and E. Maloney defeated R. Mnrphy and A.
Ponnoyer, 21â13, 14â 21, 21â 17. J. C. Nea
lon and T. F. Bonnet defeated P. Donnelly and
J. Riordan, coast champion, 21â14, 20â21,
21-18.
