THREE SUCCESSIVE DEFEATS

Control of the Province of Santiago
da Cuba by the Insurgents
Is Absolute.
HAVANA, Cuba, May Authentic
news received here from Mazanillo and
Santiago de Cuba describes the military
situation in Orient as most desperate for
the Spanish troops. The control of the
province of Santiago de Cuba by insur
gents under Generals Calixto Garcia and
Jesus Rabi is absolute^ and the towns
of Holguin. Jiguani and Bayamo are
practically besieged by the Cubans.
No communication with these towns
from Mazanillo and Santiago is possible
without a large sacrifice of Spanish sol
diers. About eight days ago the Spanish
battalions of Alcantara and Andalusia
combined for the purpose of conveying a
supply train to Bayamo. The Spanish
garrison at that place is in great distress
because all the provisions sent since
March have fallen into the hands of the
Cubans.
The two battalions named under in
structions from General Linares united
with some local Spanish guerrillas around
Mazanillo, making a total of 5000 men.
With this force and three cannon the
Spanish believed they could safely reach
i-.i.'amo with supplies and return to I
Mazanillo.
The enterprise, in spite of all the hopes,
was as great a failure as the previous !
ones, and gave Garcia one of the most
brilliant victories in his military career.
About half way on the route which the
Spaniards had followed Garcia placed bis
infantry, strongly fortified in intrench
ments and protected by cavalry on both
flanks. The Spaniards tried to pas?, but
were twice repulsed, and when the Cuban
cavalry entered the fight the two Spanish
battalions were routed. They abandoned
their supplies and sought refuge on the
other side of the River Buey.
In the battle the Spaniards lost 226 sol
dier, dead and wounded, all being left on
field, iiany officers were also killed.
The Cubans pursued the fugitive Span
iards and at a ford in the river killed
many more. Others were drowned on ac
count of the panic.
While this defeat oi his two battalions
was taking place at Buey River General
Linares himself suffered another reverse '
in attempting to cross Canto River. His
vanguard, in reconnoitering the river, |
met with a strong body of insurgents
Linares retired with three officers and
twelve soldiers killed and six officers and
twenty-two soldiers wounded. .â¢Â»'

of the insurgents. After two hours' fight

Republicans of the House Will Not
Rush Throueh the Cuban
Resolutions.
WASHINGTON., D. C, May 27.âRepre
sentative James Hamilton Lewis of Wash
ington, before the question of approving
the journal of Monday's proceedings had
been . put, rose to a question of personal
privilege in the House to-day. He sent to
the clerk's desk a resolution to the effect'
that the Senate having passed the resolu
tion recognizing the belligerency of Cuba
the House should proceed to express its
sentiments upon the subject.
Dicglev made the point that it was not
a matter of privilege, but the Speaker per
mitted Lewis to state his point. .--.,. Jyyjy- â¢';
Lewis cited several precedents. The lat
est was that in the Fifty-third Congress,
when Dingley introduced a similar reso
lution regarding the policy in reference to
Chile. McCreary, chairman of the Com
mittee on Foreign Affairs, bad made the
point of order that it was not a question
of privilege and the present occupant of
the chair (Reed) was quoted as observing
that matter touching the foreign policy
of the Government was a question of priv
ilege of the highest order.
Lewis' remarks were greeted with ap
plause by the Democrats. .--- ."--/, . ..â *..
The Speaker sustained Dingley's point
of order, suggesting that the gentleman
from Washington could get a considera
tion of his resolution by introducing it in
regular order, having it referred and get
ting a report of the committee.
Lewis appealed from the decision of the
chair, and, on motion of Dineley, the
House votedâ 9l to 57â to lay the appeal
on the table. rJJJti.
Not satisfied with this, Lewis demanded
and secured ayes and noes. The vote re
sulted: Ayes S3, noes 51.
This was not a quorum, and in view of
this disclosure, on motion of Dingley, the
House adjourned until Monday. JJk-
The result of the a-J^empt to force a con
sideration of the Cuban resolution was
unexpected to the outside public, as it
was generally believed that the Republi
cans would refuse to support the Speaker
in this matter. It was asserted that the
Cuban feeling was so strong that it would
completely overshadow all party feeling,
and that the Speaker would have at least
three-quarters of the House against him.
There has been some very effective work
done among the Republicans in the House
during the past few days however. They
have suddenly awakened to the fact that
by combining with the Democrats they
are tying the hands of their own President
and are seriously embarrassing the move
ments of the executive. Speaker Reed,
Senator Hanna and others familiar with
the plans of the President have all uttered
words of warning and they have had their
effect on the Republicans. "Whatever the
ultimate action in the case may be it
seems certain now that the resolution will
not be rushed through the House.

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, MAY 28, 1897.
TURKISH CAVALRY CHARGING THE GREEK INFANTRY AT VALESTINO.
This picture, reproduced from the London Graphic, represents one of the principal episodes in the fighting at Velestinc.
It was a mad charge made by a body of Turkish cavalry, numbering about fifty.- It was magnificent, says the Graphic corre
spondent, to see the way in which these Moslem horsemen came on to attempt the impos ible. The order of their advance
was perfect, but their steeds were blown before they .were up the slope and, in face of the fire from the Greek infantry, more
than half their number had sunk out of sight In the standing corn. The remnant turned, though. some struggled to reach
the top. They lost thirty-seven men, and none but riderless horses came through the battery. The charge was a miniature
Balaclava, and the order was splendidly carried out. ' r ( ' ''â¢*''' ',-' . y â 'â

A SENSATIONAL ACTION
'PROMISED.
Insists That She and the General
Were Engaged to Be
Married.
SUING ON A LIFE-INSURANCE
POLICY.
A Bundle of Tender Love Letters
and Hints of a Marriage
â  Contract.
' In the sweet summer time, as long ago
as 1880, there came to San Francisco from
a valley famous, for beautiful women as
fair a maiden as one would see in a season
of seminary commencements. She was
escorted on Kearny street, in Golden Gate
Park and to the yacht clubhouses at Sau
salito by a sister of style and beauty who
had just been released from the irksome
chains of matrimony. The two were ob
jects of attention and admiration.
Shortly after the advent of the comely
sisters the wedding bells chimed for the
younger. The society editors described
how gracefully the fair Theresa was led to
the altar by Allie Abell, son of the promi
nent citizen, Alexander Abell. A long
ison of happiness followed the wedding,
but soon there was a sepaiation and then
a divorce.
Free to act for themselves and to accept
such adulation as propriety dictated, the
charming sisters dwelt in San Franciio,
enjoying the allurements of metropolitan
life. As time ran merrily along General
W. H. Dimond wa3 attracted by the
beauty of Mrs.; Abell, and the comely
Theresa did not repel the advances of the
general.* There was soma quiet gossip
about the little incident at the time, but
nothing was said in the newspapers.
When the general was a candidate for
the Republican nomination for Governor
at the convention in Los Angeles, which
selected John F. Swift as the nominee of
the; party, some of his political enemies
: who had never seen the fair Theresa,
j sought to condemn him, but the con-
I demnation never came in a public form.
Whether the affections of the winsome
lady were gained by a brilliant charge, or
by. the slow and sure process of a regular
siege, has not been disclosed. It was ob
served that Mrs. Abell was installed in
sumptuous apartments and the name of
her sistir was inscribed in the payrolls of
the Mint. ';. fÂ».
The main incident and the collateral in
| cidents had almost' passed out of the
i programme of society chatter when the
suit in equity instituted in the United
j States.Circuit Court by the Fenn Mutual
â  , Life Insurance Company gave lull tongue
to every tea from : Rincou Hill to Pacific
Heights. â  7<J
The suit is about an insurance policy
for $10,000 on the Perm Mutual Life In
surance Company.
Mrs. Abeil offers to prove that a mar
] riage engagement existed between herself2
and General Dimond. She insists,
through her attorney, Frank Freeman,
that the policy for $10,000 was absolutely :
assigned to her, in spite of his revocation
of the same afterward, and that the com
pany should now pay her that sum. On
the other band, Horace G. Piatt, repre
senting the Dimond estate, contends that
the assignment was not absolute, and
that the subsequent revocation was legal.
In the Federal court a few days ago Mrs.
Abell was not allowed to testify because
General Dimond was dead, but her
brother-in-law, Geor c S. Knowles, was
permitted to testify that General Dimond
acknowledged the marriage engagement
With Mrs. Abell. JJ'? t y .;
Horace G. Piatt was called as a witness
to identify the signature of General D;
mond.
Yesterday Mrs. Abell was Been by a
Call reporter at the Hotel Alexindria,
and she expressed a determination to as
sert her rights in court. She said that she
greatly di-liked the notoriety which the
litigation had caused, but that she was in
the right and in due time the public would
be convinced that an effort had been
made to deprive her of her rights.
When asked concerning the date of her
engagement to marry General D.mond
her attorney interposed and advised her
not to discuss the subject at present. Mr.
Freeman said It was already in evidence
before the Superior Court that a marriage
engagement existed between Mrs. Abell
and General D niond.
Mrs. Abell would have kindly explained
why the general postponed the marriage,
but her counsel objected. As there were
two lawyer-- and only one reporter pres
ent the lady permitted numbers rather
than rich to prevail.
It was asserted in the genera! conversa
tion that ample proof would be presented
to establish the fact of the marriage en
gagement. At the proper time any num
ber of sweet and tender letters would be
offered by Mrs. Abell to justify her posi
tion in the premises.
Mr. Freeman was asked the direct ques
tion if a written marriage contract existed,
but declined to commit 'himself on this
point. He said: "It is not yet time to
speak, on this Question, and I cannot
answer your inquiry. We have still hfty
or sixty days' lime "in which to begin an
action to "contest the will of General
Dimond."
According to Mr. Freeman's statement
Mr?-. Abell would have testified in the
ATTORNEY - FRANK, FREEMAN.
Circuit Court the other day, had she been
permitted, that she lent General Dimond
$2100 to invest in a land scheme .near
Anderson, Shasta County. The general
â¢had as a partner in' this enterprise Mr.:
â Briggs, formerly .of the Immigration
Bureau. To cover the .advances- which
Mrs. Abell made to the general, and in
consideration of other favors, he took out
a policy for $10,000 in the Provident In
surance Company. When this policy was
canceled he deeded, through Shainwald
& Burkbee. to Mrs.* Abell a house and lot
at 1533 Sacramento street valued at $8000.
She would have , further testified that
the policy of $10.000 : in the Perm
Mutual Company was assigned in good
faith to her, but that the general re
quested her to affix her signature to a
blank assignment that he could fill out
and assign to some other person in the
event of her death.
It appears that the transaction of deed
ing the house and lot on Sacramento
street to Mrs. Abell was the last, one of a
business character that the general had
with Mrs*. Abell. This transaction tooK
place in February, 1896. General Dimond
died in the month of June following. The
marriage engagement, if one existed,
must have been made prior to 1896.
The gossip goes that the fair Theresa
was supplanted by another charmer one
of English birth and training 1895,
and that the general and Mrs. Abell were
not on good terms after November, 1895.
The case will come up again in the
United States Circuit Court on June 3,
next Wednesday.
-. Mrs. Abell is credited with a deal of
nerve and dash when she resolves to go on
the warpath. It is related that she went
after another woman some five or six years
ago. who was then living in the house of
Mrs. Nellie Wallace, 841 Golden Gate ave
nue. Mrs. Abell fancied that this "other
man" was making inroads on the gen
eral's affections, and drcided to check the
game. Accompanied, by detectives she
went to the house on Golden Gate avenue
and made such a tcene that the enemy
was put to flight.

H.O. HAVEMEYER IS
PROMPTLY CLEARED
Not Guilty of Contempt
for Refusing to
Answer. .
Justice Bradley of the District
Supreme Court Grants, a
Motion to Dismiss.
Now There Is Talk of Resumln*-*- the
Investigation of the Senate
Sugar Scandal.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 27.â Justice
Bradley in the District Supreme Co urt to
day dismissed the indictment against
Henry O. Havemeyer of the American
Sugar Refining Company, charged with
contempt of court for refusal to give in
formation to the Senate, committee in
vestigating the sugar scandal. ., ...
When the proceedings opened District
Attorney Davis began to reply to the
motion made yesterday made by Johnson
for the defense that the court instruct the
jury* to return a verdict for the defense.
Davis dealt first with. the. second point
made by the defense that it was not the
duty of Havemeyer to examine tbe books
of the company to procure data for. the
committee. He held that as Havemeyer
did object before the committee to get the
data required he should not now be basing
his refusal to answer on the allegation
ihat it was not his duty to get such data.
Davis then took up the fourth point of
the defense, and attempted to show that
contributions to the local campaign fund
had an important, bearing on the matter j
being investigated' by the committee. As
to the filth point he held that the defend- j
ant should have inquired bad he any
doubt that the question was one of the
committee and not of an individual mem
ber. Davis then reverted to the first point
that the Senate had no right to inquire as
to contributions made to State and local
campaign committees and made a lengthy
argument to prove the Senate's power re- j
garding '-. a matter which he declared I
serious enough to cause a Senater to lose '
his seat if proven.
Johnson, for the defense, said the ques
tion which the committee had to deal
with was not whether the sugar trust con- j
tributed to local or National committees, j
but whether any Senator had been in- !
fluenced" in voting on the sugar schedule j
by the use of money. Johnson could not
concede that because Havemeyer did not
decline to produce data from the books on
the first day, he was - barred from so de- I
clining on the second day. "I say to the j
head men behind the prosecution that if
it was the duty of the witness he might
be punished for refusing to answer. Even
a rattlesnake gives warning before strik
ing." Johnson did not say to whom he
referred.
At the conclusion of Johnson's argument
Justice Bradley ordered a recess, to pre
pare his ruling on the motion. Bradley
opened by saying that the questions were
worthy of great deliberation, especially
that relating ta the power of the Senate in
regard to the resolution directing the in
vestigation. These grave questions \he
had not time to study. But be was pre
pared to rule on the motion on other
grounds. He then reviewed the proceed
ings of the Senate and committee.
"Docs the testimony show defendant re
calcitrant?", he asked. "Tnis depends on

The Justice said that Havemeyer was

to the best of his memory. 1 ' He continued :
"Personal knowledge and evidence are all
that i was Â« required ',; of . the witness. The
allegation; of the indictment is Hh at the

viously testified that he had no recollec
tion of the amounts contriouted. On* all
these grounds it would/appear to me that
no court would hold the -witness, guilty of
contempt. If the defendant -was not
guilty of contempt then it is baseless to
ask whether the Senate had jurisdiction.

DOES THE COMMITIEE LIVE?
An Attempt /May Be Made to Eesunte
the Investigation. "-J. â ' ~- . ;^
WASHINGTON/ D. C.. , May . 27.'-It . is
probable \ the acquittal of Havemeyer to
day will be followed by an attempt- in the
Senate to-morrow; to secure a continua
tion of tbe so-called sugar stock investiga
tion of 1894. Contrary to the general
opinion the special committee appointed
to inquire into the alleged- stock specula
tions of Senators is still in existence, and
it is planned for some Senator to offer a
resolution instructing the committee, to
resume its investigations and issue a sub
pena to Havemeyer commanding him to
appear before it with the: books of the
sugar trust covering disbursements or con
tributions for ; political purposes in- the
campaign of 1892, thus bringing the wit
ness within the rule laid down, by Judge
Bradley. The claim that the investigat
ing committer; is still In legal existence is
based on the following facts set forth \ in
the Congressional Record:
On August 2, 1894, Gray, chairman of
the Senate special committee, made the
final report of the committee and asked
that it be discharged from further consid
eration of the subject. To the request
Chandler objected, saying:
"I think -.before the committee be dis
charged the Senate ought to have an op
portunity to read the three reports. . If
the Senator from Delaware makes no ob
jection I ask that action on his request go
over for the present."
To this Vice-President Stevenson re
sponded: -'Without objection it will be so
ordered."
There was no objection and the request
went over and was not again called up.
While District Attorney . Davis -is discour
aged over the failure to convict Have
meyer he will press the case against
Searles to-morrow on the ground that it
deals with different matters and that
Searles is guilty. Â»

NEW YORK, N. V., May 27.â The swell
society people of this city are greatly
pleased with the news which became
known to-day that people who attended
the notorious Seeley dinner will not be
brought to trial. District Attorney Ol
cott, who has charge of the affair, was
seen to-day and asked his reasons for not
conducting the prosecution with the vigor
that it should be carried on with. '
..,' Olcott at first was very taciturn, ' and
said he did not care to discuss the matter.
When pressed he finally consented .to
make a statement. He said he had defin
itely decided not to proceed with the trial
at all. His reasons for this actionâ
rather, inactionâ were thai the trial would
create a wave of immorahtv.
In the opinion of many Olcott has other
reasons for not wishing to bring the mat
ter to trial. His statement about a wave
of immorality being created is regarded
as being an absurd one. It is said thai
very strong pressure has been brought to
bear on him to drop the case, and he has
yielded to it.
Meanwhile, "Little Egypt," the girl who
gave the indecent dance at the dinner, is
traveling over the country repeating the
performance to many different audiences
at so much per head.
THE COLVMAL DAMES.
Bestoring a Knickerbocker Mansion to
-â - lis tlrlrtinal Beauty.
NEW YORK. N. V.. May 27â Members
of the Society of Colonial Dames are much
in evidence this afternoon at the opening
of the Van Cortlandt mansion in Van
Cortlandt park, one of the most distin
i guished homes of the old Dutch period.
The society has had in charge the work
of restoring the mansion to something of
I its pristine beauty. Wherever there has
been decay or wear new pieces hav-** been
substituted, care being taken that the
supplied portions : should - preserve the
antique appearance of the old. A.
Old metal-work has been freed from
j paint and varnish and burnished until it
shines just as in the famous Knickerbocker
days.
The formal opening was fixed for this
afternoon from the fact that this is the
two -hundred and fiftieth anniversary of
j the landing of Governor Petrus; Stuy-
I vesant. The Colonial Dames are employ-
I ing the mansion to a certain extent as a
museum illustrative of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, while the
grounds about the buildings have been
put into beautiful order by the Depart
ment of Parks.

Two Men Then Took Morphine and Kille*
Themselves.
MIDLAND, Mich., MÂ«y 27.â The citi
zens of this quiet town were greatly hor
rified to-duy to find two dead men in the
blacksmith-shop of George Laird.. At first
the story got around that a double murder
had been committed. The men who first
found the bodies did not attempt to iden
tify them, but rushed off in hot haste to
find the constables. He told some people
on the way about the discovery and when
the peace officers arrived a big crowd had
collec.ed around the outer door of the
shop. The bodies were lying in an ob
scure corner and when they were turned
over it was found that they were the re
mains of George Laird and James Tim
moss.-. Laird was the owner of, the shop.
It appears that the two men had been on
the wildest kind of revel ever since Mon
day. They had drunk vast quantities of
whisky and when they tired of that ".they
took some morphine. It; was this drug
which caused their death.': * â¢
Timmons was not a married man, but
Laird left a widow and child. Â

NEW YORK, N. V., May 27. âThere was

Madden/ and Cook, the two men who had

Other keepers in the park rushed to the

Finally Adopted by the

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 27.â 1n the
Senate to-day the reading of the journal
of yesterday was dispensed with, the
usual routine morning business sus
pended, and in accordance with the agree
ment of yesterday the conference report on
the sundry civil appropriations bill was
taken up, so the discussion on the forest
reservation amendment might be con
cluded.; â â 'â f-yfySrC
The Utah Senators argued against the
report, Cannon saying the opponents of
the lorest reservation should insist on the
original proposition which was an "abso
lute revocation of the order." .
Stewart declared passionately that the
setting apart of 21,000.000 acres of
forest reservation was a "dedication to
folly; and bai barism" ; that the bureau
which adyised it ought . to be abolished,
and that the* act itself was "the most bar
barous outrage perpetrated in the last
half of the century."
Allison appealed to the Senate to agree
to conference report, saying it was
within the power of the two houses to re
voke absolutely by legislative enactment
before March 4 Cleveland's order. The
conference report ou ly suspended it till
March 1 next.
Pettigrew thought the forest reservation
a good thing, but did not believe that
cities, railroads, mills, mines, farmhouses
and barns should be embraced within it.
He said in South; Dakota the area set
apart as a forest reservation contained
18 postofflces, 15.000 people and 50 miles
of railroads. He declared he would con
sider himself unfaithful to his people if be
did riot insist upon the absolute revoca
tion of the order. â¢' Ihe vote resulted in

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 27.âFor
mer Senator Call has joined the ranks of
office-seekers and visited the White House
to-day. He said to a reporter:
"I was cheated out of the senatorship
by a traitor, but have been taught a lesson
by my folly. Yes, i say folly, for I played
the part of a fool when I withdrew from
the contest temporarily and allowed my
forces to be taken in hand by this man
Stockton, who, after seeing he could not
win himself, threw my support and in
fluence to Mallory. . I needed a few more
votes. , I saw no prospects of getting them
unless 1 withdrew from the contest for a
few. days. I had -a : written agreement
with Stockton that he was to enter the
race to take my forces in hand,* bold the
reins a few days and get out of the field
when I gave the word. But when; he
withdrew it was in favor of Mallory."
Call wants to be the Democratic mem
ber of the Dawes Indian Commission.

ent. The palace commandant received
.the Embassador at the entrance ana con
ducted him to the salon door, where he
was received by the President and pre
sented his credentials. â 
Hanotaux, Minister of .Foreign Affairs,
and officers of the President's household,
were present. President Faure and Porter
conversed a little while after the formali
ties of the occasion were observed.
.*.';, In - presenting his credentials Embas
sador Porter referred to the bonds of sym
pathy between the United States and
France, â  which, h*> said, resulted from
both countries having similar govern
ments, from their common attachment to
liberal institutions and from their alli
ance at the birth of the American Repub
lic. These had created imperishable ties
of friendship. "'
President Faure replied in a similar
vein, saying that with r the common idea
of democratic social progress the two
countries would always find a footing for
friendly agreement. Ââ'",

FLAGSTAFF, Abiz., May 27.â Jim Par
ker, ' train - robber, murderer and jail
breaker, is safe in a steel cell of the jail at
Flagstaff. He was brought in at 6 o'clock
this evening by S. 8. Preston, who runs a
trading-post; at Willow Springs, ninety
miles northeast of Flagstaff.
Tuesday morning Parker ate breakfast
with Preston and then took the trail
northward. Parker told Preston he was
trailing stolen horses. Preston suspected
bis visitor, and went twelve miles east to
Yuba City, where he secured a description
of the fugitive. Preston : sent an Indian
courier into Flagstaff' with the news, and
then set out after Parker with a posse of
ten Navajo trailers. Tuey came up with
the fugitive after dak and surrounded
his camp while he slept.
At daybreak a gun was fired to waken
Parker, who started up with his Win
chester ready to fire. Preston told him to
drop his gun. Parker took in the situa
tion very quickly. He hesitated but an
instant, then lowered his rifle and let the
Indians come up and lash him - securely,
while Preston kept him covered t with a
gun that almost touched : bis forehead.
Parker was tjjen tied on a horse and the
party set out for Flagstaff. About noon ;
they wero met by Sheriff Ruff and his
posse.
Parker had two good horses and plenty
of provisions and ammunition. The
horses belong to parties living near Wil
liams. Parker was on his way â¢to r Lee's
ferry, and if he had crossed the river in
safety he would have been practically be
yond, pursuit. Parker was fagged out
when he reached Flagstaff, and seemed
despondent. The various rewards offered
for his capture amount to $3000, and these
will be claimed by Preston.
An extra guard has been placed upon
him in jail, and he is not likely to escape
again. It is thought he will be kept here
until tried, as the authorities fear mob
law at Prescott. *.â¢-;'

2 THE CALL SPEAKS FOR AllFOUR NEW
TEST VOTES
ARE TAKEN
â 
Plenty of Votes to Pass
the Tariff Bill in
the Senate.
GOOD PROGRESS BEING
MADE.
Several Paragraphs In the
Measure Go Over With
out Action.
TWO MORE PAGES, HOWÂ£VÂ£B,
ARE DISPOSED OF.
Headed by Vest, the Democrats
Assault the Vulnerable Points
In Vain.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 27â The
Senate made such satisfactory progress
to-day in the consideration of the tariff
bill that Aldrich, who has parliamentary
charge ot the measure, expressed himself
as quite satisfied with .he three hours and
over given it and consented to an early
adjournment.
Two pages of the bill were disposed of, I
bringing it down to the sixty-fourth para- j
graph of schedule A (chemicals, oils and i
paints). There was not the slightest dis
position shown on the part of the Demo
crats to waste time unnecessarily in long
arguments, but at the same time they j
showed a determination to assail the bill i
in every one of its vulnerable points. The !
fact that there was a good working ma
jority to be relied upon for the final pas- j
â -age of the bill, which was proved by the I
first vote yesterday, was confirmed by four I
aye and no votes to-day. The first of !
these showed exactly the same majority
as yesterday (fourteen), two Nevada Sen
ator*- voting with the Republicans and
McEnery of Louisiana going back to the
Democratic ranks.
The second vote, which w*:s on amotion
Sto reduce the duty on morphine from $1
tv 57 cents an ounce, added one to the Re
publican party, McEnery going back to
that side, and Kyle (Pop.) also voting
with the Republicans.
On the third vote the majority was re
duced to 8 and on the fourth to 6, Mc-
Enery again voting with his own party
and Pettigrew voting with the Democrats.
The two Neva la Senators stood by the
Republicans every time. Several para
graphs went over without action. They
were coal tar, drugs, collodion, gelatine,
glue, olive oil, Prussian and Chines:
â  blue.-, ultramarine blue and phosphorus.
The bill will be taken to-morrow at
paragraph 64, and there will be eighteen
paragraphs to be disposed of before the
schedule relating to earth, earthenware
ard glassware will be reached. The most
frequent talkers to-day on the Democratic
side were Vest, Jones of Arkansas, Gray
and Caffery. The task of defending the
various provisions devolved almost ex-,
clusively on Aldrich.
Paragraphs 8 and 9 were agreed to with
out discussion. In paragraph 10 the
Finance Committee reported a substitute
which places a duty of 5 cents a pound on
borax, 4 cents on borate of lime or soda
of certain acid strength and 3 cents on
borates of less strength. ,"'-'.
Vest moved to make the rate IJ^ cents
on borax crude or borates of soda and
lime and 2 cents a pound on refined borax.
Tne motion was rejected and the commit
tee substitute agreed to. The duty on re
fined camphor was put at 6 cents a pound,
against 4 cents in the House bill, ground
chalk at 1 cent and chloroform at 15 cents
instead of 21 cents.
When paragraph 19 (drugs such as
barks, beans and root.*) was read, Aldrich
moved to add to the 10 per cent in the
Home % cent a pound. Vest protested,.
saying last year the United States had ex
ported $900,000 worth of such drugs, and
imported only $79,000 worth, showing the
American producers had absolute control
of the market, and now it was proposed to
add \i cent a pound to the duty. He
wanted the ,- ayes and noes on that sort of
legislation."
The amendment was agreed â 35 to 21.
While the vote was being taken Berry said
he was paired generally with Teller of
Colorado with the understanding that he
might vote on any question in the tariff
bill he chose, except upon certain re
served questions, and that Teller himself
expected to be present when the vote will
be taken on the passage of the bill.
Paragraphs 20 and 21 were agreed to
without question, and i aragraph 23 (gela
tine, glue, isinglass, etc.) went over with
out action. When paragraph 28 was
reached, "chicle 6 cents a pound," Gray
asked wbat"chicle" was. He was told it
was a Mexican gum used in the preparation
of chewing-gum; it was now on the free
list, and would produce a revenue of $217,
--000 at the rate proposed. Paragraph 38,
making the duty on olive oil 35 cents a
gallon instead of 50 cents, as in the House
bill, went over without action at the re
quest of Senator Perkins. In paiagraph
41, making the duty on opium for smok
ing $8 a pound instead of $6, as in the
House bill, Aldrich withdrew the amend
ment, so the duty is fixed at $6.
Jones of Arkansas moved to reduce the
rate on morphine and all salts of opium
fiom $1 an ounce to 50 cents. He read a
communication to show the enormous
profits made now by chemists in the sale
of morphine, and demanded ayes and noes
on the motion. His amendment was de
bated, 24 to 39. Paragraph 43 (Prussian
and Chinese blues, etc.), was passed over
at the request of Sewell. Paragraph 46
(chrome yellow, etc.), was changed by
making the duty of 4J^ cents a pound
apply where lead and soda, are used "in
pup, dry or ground," and by omitting
the last clause of the paragraph. v
Vest moved to reduce the rate on white
lead (paragraph 53) from 2% cents a pound
to \y_ cents. He declared . the rate pro
posed by the committee was abnormal
and it was unnecessary to increase it, and
demanded the ayes and noes." The motion
was lost, ayes 27, noes 15. ,
When paragraph 56 was reached, which
puts a duty of 30 per cent ad valorem on
paints, colors and pigments, Aldrich said
in answer to questions proposed that the j
rate was higher than under the McKinley
act, and the increase was recommended
to protect American producers against
large importations. '"â 'â 
"Another case of diminishing reveuues
by diminishing importations," Gray sug
gested.
'.â¢vVe exported last year," said Vest,
! "SBBO,OOO worth of paint. That is the
I mathematical answer to the Senator's
I statement."
Paragraph 58 (phosphorus) went over
j without action. Aldricb moved to make
j the duty on caustic or hydrate of potash
j 2% cents a pound, instead of 2 cent?, as
recommended by the Finance Committee,
and instead of 3 cents, as in the House bill.
Vest protested acainst the proposed
increase. Piatt of Connecticut favored it,
saying the United Alkali Company of
England, with a capital of $30,000,000, had
put down the price of chlorates in the
United States so as to crush out co
operating on Niatrara. ...â¢.'â¢
"Then the formula is," said Caffery,
"that when we have a market we must
hold it by high taxes, and when we have
not a market we must get it by high
taxes." â yJJ'f.
Vest remarked that he was too much of
an American to think the Niagara Falls
required protection against any thine that
could be produced in England. [Laughter.]
The discussion led to a colloquy between
Caffery and Gear on the subject of sugar
bounty. Caffery spoke of bounty as a
demoralizing gift, the bad consequences of
which weie now seen in the proposition to
pay an export bounty on cereals, cotton
and tobacco. â¢
"I imagine," Gear said, "that the Sena
tor himself was a beneficiary of the sugar
bounty."
â¢â¢There' is a proverb," Caffery replied,
"which says, 'Never look a gift horse in
the mouth.' The sugar bounty was forced
upon us. We did not want it. But the
duty on sugar is the keystone of the arch
Democratic idea of tariffâ tariff to pro
duce revenue and sugar produces more
revenue than any other article on the
list."
The fourth vote of the day was taken on
Aldrich's motion to make the duty on
caustic or hydrate of potash '2% cents in
stead of 2 cents a pound. The motion
was carried by 33 to 27. In paragraph 63
the committee amendment to strike out
the House clause putting a duty of 6 cents
a pound on cyanide of potassium was
agreed to, leaving that article subject to
the basket clause of 25 per cent, but notice
was given by Stewart and Rawlins that
they would try to have it put on the free
list in tbe interest of gold-miners, in
whose business it was of great import
ance.
At this stage Aldrich said in view of the
considerable progress made and of the
fact that the Senators engaged in the ex
amination of the bill had undergone great
fatigue last week he would consent to let
the bill go over.
After a short executive session the
Senate adjourned till to-morrow.
SAN RAFAEL'S POISONING CASE.
Little Chance to Catch the Scoundrel I
Who Drugged the Milk of the
Masten Family. â 
SAN RAFAEL. Cal., May 27â But
little chance remains that the person who
poisoned the milk of the Masten family of
this place will ever be caught. District
Attorney E. B. Martinelli said this after
noon that tbe investigations instituted had
not as yet revealed sufficient evidence to
warrant the arrest of parties supposed to
be implicated in the- affair.--. The case is
one that has astounded the people of- San
Rafael and almost caused the death of
seven people. *' '"....â'
It appears that N. K. Masten, who is
financial agent of the Southern Pacific
Company, came to San Rafael on the first
of the mo-nth and rented a house in which
his family, his son's family and the family
of his son-in-law, Mr. Perkins, lived.
Sunday, directly after dinner, the entire
household exhibited violent signs of
poisoning, and Dr. vYickman was called
in. An investigation showed that those
who had partaken freely, of the milk at
the table had been most affected, and led
the family to believe that the milk had
been poisoned.
Shortly befoie, a letter had been received
from some unknown person warning them
against the milk furnished by Milkman
Butterworth, who was supplying them,
they having recently changed irom a man
named Vanning to Butterworth. The
authorities have been busily investigating
the affair, but no evidence has yet been
obtained that will warrant arrests. The
affair has naturaily created the greatest
excitement, as it is said a similar case has
been discovered. .V- yyJJ

Professor -Fabian- of Fresno Explains
lhatTt*nlia Episode.
FRESNO. Cal., May 27â Professor Ben
jamin W. Fabian, a talented teacher of
music, : who enjoys the patronage of
Fresno's best society, also has a class of
pupils at Visalia, and he visits that place
once a week to teach them. According to
reports from Visalia the professor had
talked too freely about a Mrs. Eckstein,
the wife of- a well-known citizen. Mr.
Eckstein heard of the professor's state
ments, and last Sunday caught him board
ing the train on bis way home to this city.
Tne professor is said to have known
that the irate husband was after -him and
<ook a sudden departure to escape him.
Eckstein walked, up to the music teacher,
who was sitting in the coach, and dealt
j him some hard blows in the face. The
professor did not resent the indignity and
merely tried to shield himself with his
hands. The train then started ; and the
irate husband hurried to get off. :
Professor Fabian denied to-night that '
he had ever spoken disparagingly of Mrs.
Eckstein. He --ays the husband was i
drunk when he made the attack.

Shot at Belated Citizens on the
Street, and the Police Are V
Still Hunting Him.
STOCKTON, Cal., May There were
two robberies of road houses near the out-'
skirts of Stockton late last night, and two
attempted hold-ups of pedestrians on the
â¢astern edge of the city. The man who
did the deeds first mentioned is thought
by the authorities to be the one who at
tempted the hold-ups on East street. The
first robbery occurred shortly after 9
o'clock last night, but the authorities,
were not apprised of the fact until this
morning. â â â Â, . - i-'-C v â¢' -:â 
The Washington House, just this side
of Nightengale, a short distance from
Stockton, was the first place the highway
man visited. It is kept by j Mrs. Lavy,
who was in the place with her daughter
about 9:30 o'clock last night. At : that,
hour a man entered with a red handker
chief tied across his face, covering his
nose and extending down below the chin.
He carried an old-fashioned. Colt's re
volver, which he leveled at Mrs. Levy, at
the same time demanding money. Mrs.
Levy's daughter, Flora, who was in the
room at the time, proceeded to give the
robber a piece of her mind, but he laughed
at the tongue-lashing of the indignant
girl, and proceeded to help himself to the
contents of the till and to a bottle of
whisky. ;" < JJJ]
"Good night, ladies," said the robber
when he had secured the money ; and the
bottle.
"I hope it will be a long time before we
see you again," said young Miss Levy.
The robber evidently walked down the
road toward Stockton and drank some of
the whisKy to prime himself for further
depredations.
His next victim was Charles Turner,
proprietor of the Park House, on the out
skirts of Stockton, near the race track. It
was shortly before 10 o'clock when the
man with the red handkerchief acioss his
lace entered. Turner was sitting in the
resort chatting with - two companions
when the man appeared, with a club in
one hand and a revolver in the other.
Turner was compelled to turn over the
i contents of the cash drawer, but the lone
robber did not search the men, all of
whom had money in their possession.
Wnen the highwayman had gone Tur
ner cared his shotgun and gave chase.
i He spied t:ie robber and' tired several
I shots at him, the robber returning the fire
' and escaping across the vacant lots toward
j town. Turner had no telephone and so
| did not report the robbery until to-day.
Shortly before 11 o'clock Street Superin
| tendent Bid well was hailed on East street
! and when he refused to stop the man who
â  accosted him fired a shot at him. Bidwell
hastened home and telephoned for the
police, but no trace of the man could be
found. â¢--â .. â ,- .â¢ â â â  . ;***VyÂ«f*.r;

IMPOKTA>T ray CATTLEMEN.
Quarantine Will Probably Be [ Lifted
Uy-AJ^.i. trims the Slate Shortly.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 27âGov
ernor Budd has received a telegram from
Professor Morse, a member of the State
Board ot Health- and president of 'the
San Francisco Health Board, dated
Washington, 1). C, which will be of great
interest to all cattlemen in the j State, and
more especially in Northern California. *
It will be remembered that some time
ago the Agricultural Department ac
cepted a report to the effect that -splenic
fever, or Texas fever, existed I among cat
tle in this State, and accordingly there
was issued a quarantine order, forbidding
the grazing of California cattle in Nevada
or elsewhere over the border, and also
forbidding the shipment . of California
cattle. " '.'â .... ' .â '- '"-,'"'"'''
Governor Budd, being appealed to by
the cattlemen, appointed Morse to go to j
Washington and do what he could to re
move the quarantine ; and the telegram |
shows that Morse has been successful in
freeing from quarantine all that portion
of Northern California above an imaginary
line extending, approximately, westward
from Lake Tahoe. .;*â >â¢ .
Morse also states that another inspector
will shortly visit" California, and the
Governor entertains the hope that the
quarantine will be lifted from the re
mainder of the State at an early date. He
will shortly issue a proclamation in ac
cordance' with -the decision of the Agri
cultural Department
MILL VALLEY VANDALISM.
Some Unknown Person Starts a Car in
Motion on the Tarn afpais Scenic
Railroad.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., May 27â About
9 o'clock last night some. unknown person
! withdrew the blocks from : under the
wheels of a passenger coach of the Mill
Valley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic road,
which was standing in the woodyard near
the station, and released the brakes, al
lowing the car to move down the grade.
As .the track at this point is on a curve
the car did not: obtain, much headway.
Nevertheless it passed the ticket office and
ran across Blythedale avenue, which," for
tunately at that hour, was almost de
serted, and crashed into the big niountain
cilmbing engine which, stood on the track
to the south ot the avenue. - Here the car
became stalled, occupying half the road-
way. â . "AT. yy. yjij
The railroad people are at a loss to know
who turned the car loose. The strict
orders of the road are to not only set the
brakes, tut to block the wheels also when
a car is left standing on a grade. These
rules were compiled with, and the person
who release. l the car evidently did so with
the knowledge that it would cause damage
and annoyance.
HE .ATE TDK. EVIDEXCE,
A Constable's Appetite Cau*es a Case to
lie IH*mi**i-a
SAUSALITO, Cal., May. 27.â There is
woe among the officials of Sausalito. The
enormous appetite of Deputy Constable
Eugene Creamer has been the means of
doing the officers, the court, the attorneys
and all of the parties concerned out of a
big fat fee. r JJr-yJJ' .
The story came out before Justice of the
Peace J. S. Bellrude to-day, to the aston
ishment of the assembled crowd. ,
Private Detective Jiandmaun went to
Point Pedro and secured evidence against
four Chinese who ~ were catching fish
smaller than allowed by law. Constable
R. E. Garrity of Sausalito and Deputy
Constable Eugene Creamer went to Point
Pedro, near San Qtit-iiti-i, and arrested the
illegal fishermen and brought them here.
Besides the men and the net, the small
fish found in the boat were also taken as j
evidence, and upon this evidence the
officers expected to secure a conviction.
To-day the trial was to lake place- before
Justice Bellrude. -*.'.-:
Eugene Creamer was put on the stand
and asked to produce the small fishes as
evidence. Ho replied that he had cooked
the dainty little, wigglers and eaten them.
Thus the only evidence upon which the
Chinamen: could be convicted had gone
down the- gullet of the deputy constable.
.-'. Justice Bellrude was the picture of dis
may. The big fat fee he is allowed by the
State upon a conviction was gone.
Prosecuting: Attorney Sylva almost
fainted. The constable was nonplused,
while the deputy whose appetite was be
yond his control gazed in amazement.
The case was dismissed for lack of fish
and evidence.

The Stolen Hamilton Jewels
Located by Means of an
Apia Letter.
Gems Left In Trust With Dead Jack
Letcher Found Only to Be
Lost Once More.
PORTLAND, Or., May 27.â Some time
after the death of Jack Letcher in Santa
Clara County, California, it was ascer
tained that be had been robbed. of $5000
worth of diamonds intrusted to him by
Ted Hamilton, a Butte gambler. But up
to now a mystery always attached to the
crime.
Six months before Letchrr resigned his
position to die, there came here from' San
Francisco another boyhood friend of
Jack's named Chares Plunkett. Jack
obtained for him two or three pieces as
bartender in first-class houses, and in
other respects treated him as if he were a
brother. Plunkett soon learned of the
trust diamonds that Letcher had, and he
wheedled him into allowing him to wear
them for display. Poor Jack, who believed
that ail his intimate friends were as hon
est as he, permitted Plunkett to retain
the diamonds, even when he went to Cali
fornia for treatment for galloping con
sumption, and from which State he never
returned.
Less than forty-eight hours after Letch
er's death Plunkett left for the East, car
rying with him the $5000 worth of precious
gems. Strangely enough, Hamilton, who
all this time had been in Prescott, Ariz.,
heard of Letcher's illness, and he natur
ally came up to get his diamonds. He
reacheu Letcher's home on the day the
funeral took place, but be deterred mak
ing inquiry with reference to his little
fortune till the following day. Then he
ascertained that Jack, during tbe last day
of his life, disclosed that Plunkett had the
trust diamonds and that Hamilton should
be so informed after his death.
Upon the receipt of tnis information
Hamilton at once wired to Plunkett's ad
dress here. The telegram was opened by
Baxter, he knowing of Plunkett's d**
parture East, and be so replied to Hamil
ton's dispatch". This resulted in Plunkett's
detention at Omaha, and as none of the
missing diamonds were found on his per
son or in his baggage, and no demand was
made to this city or to San Francisco, he
was allowed to proceed after a little incon
venience.
However, a recent letter from Apia,
Samoa, lifts the veil of this mystery and
obliterates a possible blot upon the mem
ory of Jack Letcher. It says that Plunkett
had been living in Apia for the past
eighteen months, and always wore a for
tune in diamonds on his fingers and
wearing apparel, so as to render him con
spicuous, indeed. Some time during the
early part of last April he was drowned
while bathing. But when his body and
clothing were found on the beach they
had been divested of all of value by the
beach-combers. Among his effects was
found a letter, written but three day-* be
fore his death, -as if he had had a premo
nition of a great misfortune beialling
him, confessing his theft of the Hamilton
diamonds and requesting their restora
tion to Hamilton, should he be possessed
of them at the time of bis death. - -

Enter* the Golden Gate.
MONTEREY. Cal., May 27.â Captain
Edward L. Josselyn. a pioneer of California
and capitalist of Monterey, died yester
day at his home in this city after about
two weeks' illness.
Captain Josselyn had a chronic disorder
which had been causing him much suffer
ing for the past few years, but only within
a month had he been compelled to take
to his bed.
At the end, in semi-delirium, he imag
ined himself again in command of a ves
sel, and his last words were: â¢â¢We have
passed the heads and now we're going in
at the. Golden Gate'' â a strangely appro
priate thing to say in beginning the last
lone voyage. '"..jy.-Jli
Captain Josselyn was born in Sang us,
Mass.; and came to California when quite
a young man. lie ran a packet ship be
tween San Francisco and points along the
coast for many years, and when he retired

where he has lived'ever since and where
he has amassed a large fortune. He leaves
a widow and one daughter and two sons,
besides sisters and brothers in his old
home in Massachusetts.
The tuneral took place to-day under the
auspices of Monterey Lodge. No. 217, P.

which organizations Captain Josselyn
belonged.

BICHPIELV'S OIL DISCOVER*.
Of fast Importance to the Southern Cat-
ifornia Railway.
SAN BERNARDINO. Cal., May. 27.â
No discovery of recent j years in this .; sec
tion has attracted so much attention hers
as that of oil by the Southern California
Railway Company <at Richfield, a small
station two miles west of its track in Santa
Ana Canyon. Chief ' Engineer Perris of
the company was in town to-day, and is
enthusiastic over the result, and declares
it relieves the company from the grasp of
the Los Angeles Oil Exchange monopoly
and secures to it an abundant supply for
the operation of its road. At present the
only prospect they have so far exploited
is a success, and is producing seventy-five
barrels per day and increasing. Success
in this . line has been so assured that
within a wees six _ more drills will be at
work or*- an area two miles square. Al
tready orders have been issued to change
the entire motive power of the road from
coal to oil, and great activity is on at the
shops here in consequence.
STUDENTS AT PACIFIC GROVE. *
The Conference Addressed by Efcquent
Speakers en a Vnr.ety of Inter
esting Topes.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., May 27.â The
last belated delegate to the Pacific Coast
students' conference arrived to-day, so
that now the list of representatives is com
rilete.
The morning's business began with a
second conference of association presi
dents, which was held in executive ses
sion. At 9 o'clock the two association
meetings convened under the leadership
of F. L. Willis and C. C. Michener. Mr.
Michener's topic was the many evils
which prevail in college life, hindering
Christian development. Some of these
evils he noted were lack of proper Sabbath
observance, dishonesty in class work, im
purity of life. One of. the ways of reme
dying these evils, Mr. Michener said, is
energetic personal work among the stu
dents. - - â¢ â 
F- L. Willis talked to tbe city represen
tatives gathered here on "Business Man
agement in the City Associations." He
discussed tbe necessity and importance of
a definite plan in maintaining a successful
institution.
At 10 o'clock the event of the morning
occurred, when Rev. Dr. Rummer of Oak
land gave the platform lecture of the day*
His theme was "Personal Work," and his
discourse was practical as well as schol
arly. The main points of the lecture were 'â¢
First, the necessity for work in order that
there may be development along any
lines; second, that each person do tne
work assigned him and for which he is
fitted; third, that each person has some
particular qualification, which he should
exercise. \ * Â»
The regular morning Bible class was
taught at 10 o'clock by Robert E. Lewi".
Questions aud general discussion by the
students followed the instruction.
The recreation period to-day was spent
by the delegates as guests of International
College Secretary C. C. Michener aboard
the yacht Twilight in a cruise about Mon
terey Bay. The day was fine, out a stiff
breeze stirred the water considerably and
thus furnished several bad cases of sea
sicknessâthe host being the worst suf
lerer, much to the amusement of the
good sailors of the party.
An opening prayer and song began the
evening session and Rev. W. L Kipp of
San Francisco was introduced by Chair
man C. C. Michener. 'The General
Claims and Needs of City Missions" was
his subject, and from absolute personal
experience as a worker in the dark and
low parts of San Francisco, he spoke,
showing in a practical and earnest way
the necessities which called upon college
men above all others, because they were
by education best fitted to labor for the
solving of the social and industrial prob
lems and the civilizing and Christianizing
of this lowest stratum of city life.
MUTINY AT SAN QUENTIN.
Jutemill Workers Again Rebel Against
The. r Food and Are Thrown Into
â 
the Dungeon.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Cal., May
27- Anotner strike occurred in the jute
mill at this prison to-day, the men giving
as a reason that the food was not prop
eily cooked and some of it not fit to eat,
and refusing to do any work until some
thing was done to remedy this., Â ,*<,*'
Warden Hale sent for Prison Director
Wilklns to come down from San Rafael
and together -they Investigated the mat
ter, but finding that the complaint made
was without any foundation and tbe men
still refusing, to work, they were returned
to their cells and locked up for the day,
only being released at meal hours. -'
Shortly after locking up time, 5 o'clock,
the work of punishment was begun.
About seventy of the ringleaders were
taken from their cells and placed in the
dungeon and arrangements were made to
place tbe greater part of the other muti
neers in cells in the south building, where
they will be kept until they are willing to
work, "whether it is one day or one
year,'' as Warden Hale says-
It is expected that this method of treat
ing th***ir refusal to work will bring the
men to terms in a short lime.
LOSS TO LOS AAGELES.
Effect of a Supreme Court Decision on
the County.
LOS ANGELES. Cal. . â < May 27.â This
county will lose about $iOOO of its annual
income by the Supreme Court decision
making void that part of the county fee
act which provided for the collection of
$1 for each $1000 of an estate in probate
over $3000.
The County Clerk, when asked as to the
number of such cases and the amounts
involved in a year, professed his inability
to ascertain these facts withont an ex
haustive searching of records. His rough
estimate of the amount which the county
would lose was, as given before, about
$2000 a year.
Some doubt exists as to whether the
money collected in the past in this wav
must now be refunded under the new in
terpretation given the law by the Supreme
Court

Her Jockey.
St. Calatine, O'Fieeta, Dunboy, Wil

SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 27âThe
running events of the Capital City Driving
Association drew a crowd of several thou
sand peot)ie to-day. The grand stand was
a mass of bright-colored ribbons, spring
bonnets, swiss and lawns, and incidentally
the feminine youth and beauty of the
capital city, with a fair sprinkling of
comely matrons. Down in the betting
ring a crowd of fully 2000 were in evi
dence and small money was more than
plenty.
In the first race (four and a half far
longs, for two-year-olds) Miss Dividend
delayed matters by refusing to go to the
post, and when her jockey dismounted
after a breakaway to lead her back to the
post she pulled away and started a lively
race by her lonely in the opposite direc
tion. She was captured at ' the wire and
returned to the post.
When Dick Lsggett got the bunch away
the filly made the pace to the three-eighths
when the favorite, St. Calatine,; went to
the front and was never headed. Castake
second, Melisio third. The latter got off
last and put up a great race.
In the second event, five and a half fur
longs, Belling, O'Fieeta waited on Kittie
Brady to the head of the stretch and then
came in as she liked. Kittie Brady, sec
ond, Lo Lo third.
In the third race, three-fourths of a
mile, Dun boy, who opened at even money,
was quickly scratched off the board. The
horses got off in ragged shape, Jerilderio
leading up the back line until entering the
stretch, when Donboy moved up and
went to the front, hard pressed by Lost
Girl, who would have won had she not
been pocketed by her jockey. -V ..â â - :-.*-**â¢'

BOLD ROBBERS OF LOS ANGELES.
Three Daring Feliows â¢ Cleverly:- Trapped
and, Captured by Sheriff , Burr 7 and
His Deputies.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 27.â 1n the
business center of this city a daylight rob
bery was committed* to-day which f ,for
boldness of execution exceeds anything
attempted here in years.
At 4:50 p. m. three men attempted to rob
the j safe in the . office .of Poiudexter <fc
Wadsworth, money-lenders, on the third
floor of the large Wilcox block, corner of
Spring and Second streets. While one of
the number remained on guards on the
ground floor corridor the other two went
up the ; elevator, ; entered the money
lenders', office and locked the door behind
them. ; The only occupant of } the office at
the time. was the stenographer of the firm,
Miss Clara Gamage. â â.>'â¢ JJ.J-^ 7 ; -*J
Presenting Â» six-shooter at the young
lady's head, one of â¢ the men commanded
her to give up ail .the money she had, She
opened the sale for the men, who pro
ceeded to go through.it, after, gagging
Miss Gamage with' a silk handkerchief
and tying her in a chair. The robbers
found only about $10 in > the safe, though
they broke open two locked drawers and
scattered the papers about in search of
more money. r .*'-.â '-â . '.ryt
'.'.When satisfied they had obtained all
tbe available cash the two men left the
office, and just outside the door, they were
confronted by several pairs of revolvers in
me hands .of Sheriff Burr;, and Deputy
Sheriffs White and Woodward. On the
demand for their surrender the robbers at
first showed fight, but finally collapsed
and were handcuffed and .taken to jail.
The third man had been caught by Depu
ties McClure and Monahan. All the cap
tures had been accomplished without a
struggle. At the jail the prisoners were
booked under the names -of George Wil
son, C. A. Marsell and George Wood.'
The capture of the bold gung was made
easy by the fact that Sheriff ; Burr had
been given a tip of the contemplated rob
bery and had, in fact, been* watching the
lellows for several days. Learning that
an attempt would be made to rob the sate
this afternoon the : Sheriff unformed
Messrs. Poiudexter and Wadsworth 01 the
scheme and they conveniently absented
themselves. The young lady was let into
the scheme to entrap the robbers and was
coachod in the part she should" play, and
she did as instructed by the Sheriff. The
officers from their hiding-place in an ad
joining office occupied . the - corridor and
caught the fellows as related.
FRESNO ESCAPES ELUDE PURSUIT.
Not a Trace of the Robbers Who Broke
.. Front; the County JailâThe Officers
Puzzled.
FRESNO, Cal-. May Frank Hall
and James Wilson, the robbers who broke
out of the County Jail yesterday morning,
ore still it large. No trace has been found
of them, * but Sheriff ;: Scott's < deputies are
maintaining a close watch on the trains
and at every bridge across the San Joaquin
and Kings rivers to prevent the ' fugitives
from getting out of the county. The
probability is that the jail-breakers are in
hiding not many miles from the city, but
the question which puzzles the officers is
how they are obtaining food. . --:iAJ.
It is now over two days since they ate
their last meal in jail and as far as can be
learned they have" not appeared at any
farm House fpr food, nor has any one seen
them. The fugitives 'have; disappeared
comnletely.' and the officers admit that
they are btffled.
| The Sheriff's office has received many re
ports to the effect that . the escapes were
seen in 'certain localities." Every one has
been investigated and the' pursuit: proved
to be a wild goose chase. * Two men were
arrested at Los iianos during the day and
for a time it was thought that the thugs
had been recaptured, but it was afterward
learned that the prisoners were not the
men wanted. * : - y :
How Hall and Wilson obtained the saw
with which they sawed the bars and cut
their way to freedom is as deeD a mystery
as ever. A plausible theory has been ad
vanced that they were smuggled in to Joe
Middleton, the outlaw who was recently
fatten to Folsom to serve twenty years.
Middleton had friends outside who -would
not hesitate to help him, but as soon as
he was convicted the jailer put an Oregon
boot on him and this prevented him es
caping. It is thought that he might have
given the saw to Hall and Wilson.

. . When 1 Dr. R. V. Pierce, of Buffalo. N. V., pub- ,
lished the first edition of fata work. The People's
Common Sense Medical Adviser, he announced
that after 680,000 copies had been sold at the reg- â¢
ular price, $1.50 per copy, the profit on which
would repay him for the great amount of labor j
and money expended in producing it, he would":
distribute the next half million free. JAs this
, number of copies has already been | sold, he is .
now distributing, absolutely free, 500,000 copies of -
this j most I complete, | interesting ' and valuable j
common sense medical work ever publishedâ
the recipient only being required to mail to him, '.
at the above address, twenty-one (21) cents in one-
cent stamps to cover cost of mailing on and the
book will be sent post-paid. It is a veritable med-
ical library, complete in one volume. It contains ;
over 1000 pages and more than 300 illustrations.
The Fret Edition is precisely the same as those
â old at $1.50 except only that the books are bound â 
In strong manilla paper covers instead of clou.
Scud now before all are, given away, _ '
known' as "Texas Tom," and he is be
lieved to have been an' outlaw of consider
able notoriety in Texas prior to making
â his residence in Modesto j three years ago.
It is supposed that some act in his outlaw
life was the indirect cause of his killing
bis wife.* ! She was about to leave him on
account of his brutality," and it is thought
that fear that when once out of his power
she : might tell of his former life led to
the crime. At times she spoke knowingly
of something of the kind, but refused to
reveal the story. The cause -riven for the.
shootineâ jealousyâ is ' ridiculed {by those
knowing the parties. . - - ~yy
Ever since the homicide, Berry has been
anxious to be sentenced to death.*; At the
preliminary examination and first hearing
be ore Superior Judge Minor, the prisoner
said he was guilty and in several dramatic
scenes begged to be put to . death and
pleaded not to be sentenced to life impris
onment.'"- " " "Jyj-JJjJ: _y'-'Jj"-
Counsel appeared to defend him, but he
insisted against their advice in asking for
immediate execution. When the order
was announc-d that he must hang^on
August 13 at Folsom state prison he fer
vently thanked the court. y Being in ap
parently buoyant spirits be made a speech
to the courtroom filled with spectators,
saying: â¢ 'â 'â " ' .â  Â .
"Good-by ladies, and gentemen; be
good to yourselves, and you ladies who
are married be- true to your husbands.
Don't forget this." . . " â  â 
On the way to the train he chatted and
joked with; acquaintances, bidding all
good-by. He seemed >' overjoyed at the
prospect of ending his life on the hang
man's gallows. * "
El Paso's Big Flood.
EL PASO, Tex., May 27.â The head
gates brotce this afternoon and the waters
of the Rio Grande are pouring into the
canal so that the waters r cover the city be
tween the canal and river. The firebell
sounded an alarm at 2 o'clock p. m. and
the exodus commencsd. Every kind *of
vehicle was brought ; into service and
loaded with household- goods and mer
chandise for transportation to places of
safety. A great deal of livestock perished.
The Santa Fe and Texas and Pacific Rail
road yards and denots are in the flooded
dicmcts. Men rode down the valley no
tifying settlers that the flood was coming.
lierce Fire in a Vinegar Factor
CHICAGO,. 111., May 27.â A fire in W.
H. Bunge Company*-* vinegar factory; this
afternoon caused a loss of $125,000. - The
building was one of the largest vinegar
factories in the West. - So rapid was the
spread of the flames that the fire depart

ing went up, and as the firemen fell back
the walls began to tumble. Two were
caught - and -' painfully hurt. . Fifty em
ployes had narrow escapes.
A WHITE LIVER
Is the kind of a liver that mean '
men are supposed to carry about.
A doctor will tell you that no one : -
can live with a white liver. = -â 
v " When the liver is at all disor-
â¢-* dered you are sure to have melan- *
choly fits and to wish to be alone.
You will have all kinds of curi-
'/'â  ous fancies and peculiar feelings. "
If the disorder is only a functional
one the liver is easily restored to
its normal condition. If the dis-
y order has its origin in. the abuse
-- r or dissipation of the man it is not
y sol easily controlled. 1 / Very few. ;;':â¢
â¢ family. doctors pay much atten- **-â¢â 
. tion to nervous troubles. AAs a :'V
1 ;> ; result the man who is so afflicted â¢
" ' will get no comfort if he consults ;;â *;
his family doctor. This being
true, hundreds of men are -com-
pelled to try other cures. , As a V
â¢ result the Hudyan remedy treat-
. - ment has been tried by many
thousands, and these thousands
have , been cured. Just ' 10,000
'..*.; men say Hudyan cures. , Do you
. believe them? You can see their .
statements in black and white.
It is a fact. Hudyan cures fail-
ing manhood, nervous debility,

CRITICISMS.
The Beard Adjourns Out of Respect
to the Late Frank
McCoppin.
The Board of Supervisors met in com
mittee of the whole last evening with the
purpose, as understood, of finally fixing
the water rate. Dr. llottanzi, however,
submitted a new resolution making ma
terial changes in the schedule as made up
in his resolution previously submitted
and which had been under consideration
for some time.
Dr. Clinton, chairman of the Water
Committee, agreed to accept Rottanzi's
schedule in order, as he said, to eliminate
controversy and have some rate adopted.
This action had the contrary effect to that
he hoped for, as Supervisor Smith de
clined to accept the new "mass of figures
hurled at him in such unexpected
fashion" and insisted upon adjourning in
order to study them at leisure.
Seeing this Clinton moved the adoption
of his own resolution. Chairman Dodge
asked Smith if c -would not withdraw his
motion to adjourn, which had been
made and seconded before Clinton took
this action. But Smith refused, insisted
on having his motion put and, it being
done, it was csrr ed by a vote of 7 to 5.
The board will meet next Wednesday
morning to take final action.
Dr. Rottanzi's new schedule cuts off
$73,000 of the reduction proposed by his
original resolution â that is to say, tbe
resolution originally made a reduction of
the company's levenue of $321,000,
while the resolution presented last night
made a cut of $243,000.
The reduction is distributed as follows:
Household, 15 per cent; meter rates, gen
eral reduction, 10 per cent; shipping, 2)
r>er cent.
The net revenue for hydrants is in
creased $20,000. For stores the rate is the
lame as on January 1, 1897.
The revenue allowed the company under
the resolution is as follows:
Jnterest on its bonds... $498,590
Interest on overdrafts. 4'i.vOO
i rating expenses 275 COO
Interest upon slock, 6 per cent 640.C00
â¢luxes 95,000
Total revenue $1,648,5
Dr. Clinton's figures, which provided for
a straight reduction of 20 per cent on
householders' rates, were as follows:
Interest on bonds. $498,500
In eiest on ov.-r i rafts 40,000
Operating expenses. 375,000
Div denos at 5 per cent on $12,800,000. 640,000
Taxes. 100,000
Total $1,653,500
From this deductions were to be made
for other revenues as follows:
Rent. $30,000
Hydrant rates increase. 8,000
Increase of business 35,000
Other sources 20.000
Total $93,000
This deducted from $1,653,500 left a net
reduction of $1,560,500.
The demanu of the company is consider
ably higher than this, as follows:
Intereston bonds $498 500
Interest at rate of 6 per cent on stocK.. 792,000 â 
Taxes 105,000 I
Kunnin-jupenses 400,000
Overdrafts 45,001;
Total $1,840,500
Britt suggested that the company furn
ish a new estimate or statement to meet
the new prop rial ion of revenues by Dr.
Rottanzi, to which Mr. Kellogg, counsel
for the company, replied:
"No; we are done. We will do no more; j
we will offer no new evidence. If either i
of these rates are adopted 1 have to say |
that we will seek relief elsewhere. We
will accept neither of them."
After some discussion the following,
offered by Dr. Rottanzi, was adopted:
Resolved, That for the purpose of computing !
water rates for the year this board will base its j
action on 123,000 shares of iue Spring Valley I
Water Works outstanding, but in no way com- I
mits itselt to an acceptance of such capltaliz*t
lion as representing actual Investment or real
value.
Lackman offered a resolution to the
effect that as a basis for fixing the rate
the interest on the capital stock of
the company be computed at 5 percent
instead of 6 per cent, as heretofore. ;
Clinton advocated the adoption, and it
passed. -. . : yryy_
The session was enlivened by Mr. Smith
making a tart attack on Dr. Clinton when
the latter urged that determinate action
betaken on the water rate at once. He
--aid that a new mass of figures had been
thrust at the board, which the members
could not be expected to understand; that
they had danced attendance upon the
chairman of the Water Committee (Clin
ton) for a long time, and he could not
tnrust these figures down their throats
now; he (Smith) wouldn't swallow them.
He insisted on. an opportunity to study
them. He asked that copies of the new.
resolution be placed in the bands of every
member. The majority supported him in
this request and his motion to adjourn.
Dr. Rottanzi promised to have copies of
his resolution typewritten lor all the mem
bers.
Britt opposed the Rottanzi resolution
and sad he would vote against 'it. The
Water Committee had in its*, report pro
nosed a straight reduction of 20 per cent
en the householders' rates. He believed
this was where the reduction was needed
and would do the most good.
This brought Dr. CI nton back to a
support of the committee's resolution, and
it is probable he will stand by it at the
next meeting. .
The watÂ«Â»r company's report was read
by Chief Engineer Schussier. It was as
follow*: "';â )
I To the Honorable Water Committee of the Hoard
I of Supervisors of the City and County of San
\ i-'iancisco Gentlemen: We take ihe liberty of
"\ making a lew remarks in connection with the
Report accompanying the water rates pro
posed and th<- remarks made in presenting the
same to the Water Committee.
Dr. Clinton in Ills report states: "In addi
tion your committee have determined that the
sum of $03,000 is. a reasonable amount' to
estimate* tor the increase of revenue during
the year." y â  '
Now the average increase in the number of
ratepayers since 1892 -has been 926: per an
npii. and although we supplied to the City in
1896 674,000,000 gallons more than in 1892
tne income from -private "water rates was
$18,459 74 less in 1896 than in 1892. .
: it tne rates were left the same as at present,
and if we assume an increase of say 900 in the
number of ratepayers during the i next fiscal
year, the increase from, private ratepayers
during the year 1897-98 . would be scant
$18,000; therefore, to ; bring the increase of
revenue from the $18,000 from private con
sumers to the $63,000 assumed by Dr. Clinton
means would have to be found to raise the
necessary $45,000 from the Ctt ; but you can
only count on the above increase of $18,000
by leaving the private rates as they are now. â¢
During the five yÂ»ars from 1892 to 1896 in
clusive me Spring Valley .Water Works spent
$1,848,749 80 for new construction to meet
the growing wants of the City and the large
requirements of the Fire Department. The
annual additional interest paid by the com
pany on stock especially sold for tne purpose
of raising the shove sum of $1,848,749 80
amounts to $110,000 per annum.
In 1892 the City paid to the Spring Valley
Water Work** for fire hydrants and other bills
the sum of $85,988 13, and to this extent the
private bills received the benefit. Since' that
year about 1450 new hydrants have been set
and seventy-five and a naif miles of large and
extra heavy pipes were laid in the City of San
Francisco."
In ord'.;r to make up to the Spring Valley
Water Works the requisite income the City in
creased tne hydrant rate to $5 per
month, so that in 1890 the total amount
of money received from tne City was $213.
--917 73. which sum is $127,929 60 more than
received in 1892.
Deducting irom this latter sum the amount
of $110,000 of additional annual interest paid
on new construction, you have a balance of
about $18,000, which approximately offsets
the above loss, 111 private bills since 1892, of
$18,459 74.
Even if vonr committee would agree to fur
nish for 1897-98 the above sum of $4p,000
additional from the City it would require (hi
the rale of $5 per month per hydrant) the sot
ting o: 1500 new hydrants at the rate of 125
per month, commencing June 1, 1897.
The main difficulty in the way of setting
such a large number of hydrants would be the
enormous outlay for additional large pipes, on
which also additional interest would have to
be paid.
In fact, unless the proper additional income
for additiona hydrants were allowed by the
City we could not afford 10 go to the great ex
pense of increasing the length and sizes of our
pipe system in order to place thereon even the
500 additional hydrants that have been
talked about by the committee.
In Dr. C-i Dion's report he also states: "No
Investigation is needed to convince the great
majority of the ratepayers of San Francisco
that they are paying excessive rates for water.
There is no satisfactory reason why this City
should have to pay so much higher rates for
water than any other city of its size in the
United States." - ; -â .
Dr. Cliutcn In his report, for reasons best
known to himself, refrains from saying, as
proven ii this investigation, that this City is
much more hilly than any of the larger East
ern cities; that water here is furnished to
much higher levels; that it is scarcer and
more difficult and expensive to obtain here;
that coal is three times as dear here; that
wages, machinery and pipes are much higher
here than in the East, and in addition, both
Dr. Clinton and Mayor Phelan should know
that In this City the ratepayers pay about
seven-eights of the entire annual cost of the
water supply and the City pays only one
eighth, while In most Eastern cities with mu
nicipal ownership the city bears the burden of
the entire cost of construction and most of the
interest on the same, while the consumers pay
only the running exoenses.
Allot" this infotmaiion. which in all fairness
belongs in the report, you have kept out of it,
and by such omission any prejudice that may
be existing against this company is likely to
be still more increased.
Without a full consideration of the aDOve
facts and of all the information furnished to
your committee you propose rates which, if
carried out, would be unfair to the consumers,
as they favor one class at the expense of an
other, and which would be unjust to the com
pany, because they are not based on the facts
brought out in your investigation.
Our Alameda Creek water works have been
pronounced by some; members of the Water
Committee as an unnecessary adjunct to the
company's works and should therefore 'be
thrown out and no interest allowed on the
cost of its property and works. Now, the Ala
meda Creek water works were purchased ana
the water brought to this City long before the
completion of tne large Crystal Springs reser
i voir, the Alameda Creek works being built for
the purpose cf averting a threatened water
famine.
The water of Alameda Creek having been
brought to San Francisco as an urgent neces
sity, as was recognized by the decisions of the
courts oi Alameda County, its necessity being
proven beiore your committee, as before other
Boards of Supervisors, and this water having
been supplied to San Francisco prior to the
water from the large Crystal Springs reser
voir, you have no right to exclude it- ' . "â¢
Much has been said too about watering' the
stock oft company by the consolidation of
the old Spring Valley water works and the
San Francisco water works in -1865. The fact
is that prior to that time there were two water
companies, each with- complete works, sepa
rate offices and separate managements, each
company being incorporated for $3,000,000
and each supplying about 2,000,000 gallons
of water per day.
Upon the two old companies coming to
gether the new or present Spring Valley
Water Works was incorporated for 00.000
shares of $100 each, thereby not increasing
or watering their stock. Hut, by the consoli-
d ation, they very largely reduced the running
I and office expenses, as one of employes and
one office sufficed, where formerly they had
| two. The current rale oi interest at that time
was about IJ^ per cent â  per month and over;
still, for nearly ten years, until May, 1874, the
shareholders received only 6 per cent â  per an
num on their stock, patting the balance of
their earnings, which weri large (as can be
easily seen in the reports of the City's ex
perts), back into the works, thereby increas
ing the cost and value of the works to fully
the par value of the stock.
If the Water Committee is desirous to reduce
the cost of water to the consumer, it will have
to be done at the expense of the taxpayer, as
is done in most Eastern cities, where the mu
nicipality owns the waterworks and charges
the bulk "of the cost and of the interest charges
to the property, and often only the running
expenses to the consumers. .
In the case o( the Spring Valley Water Works
the running expenses are less than one-fourth
of oar entire annual receipts.'
If the City of San Franci'ci should decide to
own its own water works, whether it builds
new ones* or purchases those of the Spring
Valley, interest on the cost of such works, the
annual contribution to the sinking fund, as
required bylaw, and the taxes in counties
outside of San Francisco, would require an
increase in the tax rate of irom 50 to 00 cents
on each one hundred dollars of the as
sessed valuation. This would leave only the
running expenses of, say from 20 to 25 per
cent of the total annual cost of water to be
paid by the consumer, thereby reducing his
water rate to about one-fourth of what it is
now.
Tbe bulk ot the burden would thus be shifted
on to the property-owner, but where at present
a landlord whose house is empty has his
entire water rate remitted in the ess:* of the
City's ownership ha would have to pay 10 the
Tax Collector his entire annual water tax of
say 50 or 60 cents on each $100 valuation
whether the house is empty or not.
The great uncertainty regarding the final
action of your Water Committee has been the
direct cause of throwing from 140 to 150
laboring men out of, our employ, on .most of
whom a family depends, and their enforced
Idleness having now lasted for several months,
owing to delayed action of your committee
â it;*! the doubt as to your final decision, great
hardship has resulted to ; those who can least
afford it. â ;. ;â - :.. : â "..'-.â . Â*%:-.-; .:-.-*,
During your, investigations.no fault was
found with the interest which we have to pay
on our bonded -debt and overdrafts nor with
the taxes, which are determined by the ci y
and -the various county: governments; nor
with '.he running expenses, especially when it
was shown that, in spite ot a largely Increased
business and water supply, they are not as
high now as they were live years ago.
The - whole difference, therefore, between
your committee and the Spring Valley Water
Works has narrowed down to the question of
what rate of interest the stockholders of this
company shall receive on their investment. B
Although we have shown by competent tes
timony the much more hazardous character
of t our business as compared, for Instance,
with a safe, conservative banking Institution,
still the gist of the two water-rate schedules
introduced with the accompanying report and
i-peeches Is to reduce the interest on our stock
i for the Clinton order to about 4 per * cent,
while if the so-called Rottanzi order were car
ried out the interest on the stock would be
renucea to about SJ-jf per cent per annum. â 
* Oi your two principal financial expertsâ
viz , Mayor Phelan and ex-Mayor Pondâ the
former is at the head of a savings bank which
pars to its stockholders an annual dividend
of 6 per cent on the amount paid in oi $30 per
share, and, besides, made last year a hand
some addition to its contingent fund.' ;.;â *->--*â ;''
Kx-Mayor Pond Is a prominent stockholder
and director In another large savings bank,
the par value of whose shares is '$250, on
which par value we are informed that a divi
dend of fully 10 per cent per annum was paid.
Now it very strange thai these two promi
nent exponents of 6 per ceut Interest, or. over,
on their own moneys, should testify, when It
comes to the j Spring Valley Water Works, in
which they apparently have no shares, that 5
per cent per annum is ample. .: -Â<
Both of these gentlemen should know: that
ihe business of C inducting a large water-works
p. ant v like $ ours jis much more exposed to
hazards than the carefully conducted banking
institutions above leferred to. * i.

veracity of business and professional men who
have appeared before you. *?;--. .Â»:.* I * v-v- . â -. a

SINGLE TAX NO REMEDY.
John Heeoan Attempts to Con
trovert the Theories of
Henry George.
Several of the Apostles cf the Great
Single Tax-r T k- Up the
Issir.
John Heenan in a lecture before Liberty
Branch of the Socialists in the Turk-street
Temple Wednesday evening had for his
subject "The Fallacy of Single Tax as a
Remedy for Social Evils." yy y ; *; ;"
He laid down three propositions, upon
which he based his argument of over an
tour in length, tending to show that the
single tax as. a "world remedy" was a
"fallacy"; first, that the single tax did
not propose to lessen rents; second, it
would not increase wages, and third, it
would not lower the price of a loaf of
bread.
The single-lexers, he said, accepted as
the elements of production or the creation
of wealth land, labor and capital, under
the present conditions of freedom and
competition. Under them, he said, labor
pays all the taxes, and, with the single
tax in vogue, would continue to do so. ,
Tne single tax would in no wise benefit
the poor much less bring about the extir
pation of poverty and the general uplift
ing of mankind as claimed for it by Henry
George. It meant nomine more than a
changing of landlordsâ the private owner
had the public treasurer.
In order to collect the necessary revenue
the tenant would be forced to pay, and
failing would be evicted, as he is at pres
ent by tie land-owner. He declared as un
true the declaration of the single-taxers
that with the passing of time the demand
for land and the consequent increase in
the unearned increment was in proportion
to tlu. demand for labor.
Hi declared that labor contributed
much more to the creation of value as
civilization progressed than did lan 1, in
stancing the difference in the quality of
the cloth worn by the people, now over
what was in vogue fifty years ago.
But five-minute speeches were permit
ted in reply and two persons took up the
cause of the single taxâ P. Ermis and
Henry Please. They both complimented
the speaker upon his argument, for
the reason that be was handling
a very difficult subjectâ very diffi
cult from his standpoint. Emm
said the speaker had overlooked a very
material point when he said the turning
of the rentals of land into the public
treasury was merely changing landlord-*.
The money thus collected, some $20,000.
--000 per annum, would mean the saving oi
that much to the taxpayer, which, it wa
admitted, was the laborer. The collecting
of that sum and the appropriation of it by
the landlords was nothing less than the
filching of tnat sum from the laborer.
" P. ease explained that rents were al
ways at their highest limit â they never
fall. When they were reduced in amount
it was in times of stress, when the pur
ch*ising power, of the decrensed amount
was equal to the greater sum of better
limes. â /â¢-â â  '-r-yj'- -
The brief time allowed the other side
did not admit of their touching more
than the central point of the argument *

in the same hall under the auspices of

Wednesday evening by Professor David
Starr Jordan of Stanford University, his
subject being "The Pursuit of HapDine-s."

The trial of the Kennedysâ husband and
wife on a charge of "cruelty to children
came up yesterday morning before Police
Judge Campbell. ; V 77'7,7J
The defendants keep a "shelter home.

Last Sunday the father called to see the
child for the purpose of bringing it to its
mother, and he -found considerable diffi
culty in even 'getting; .'ay glimpse 'of the
child, Mrs. Mary Kennedys declaring that
it was the custom of the institution not to
allow any one to see the children within
two weeks of their being brought there.':;
Backmaster {insisted and finally got his
child. The little one's face was bruised
and black in spots. yy-- , yv
- Mrs. -Kennedy said that her husband
had corrected the baby, as it was unruly,
but,' as its blood was impure, marks of the
"well-meant" castigation had remained.
. The -V explanation â -*â :â  was unsatisfactory,
and through Frank Holbrook of the Eu
reka Society for. Prevention i of Cruelty to
Children warrants were Issued for the
arrest oi the Kennedys.
Judge : Campbell dismissed the case
a^a.nst Mrs. Mary Kennedy, as ; there
was no evidence i connecting her with' the
maltreatment. The husband, ; however,
was brought before the bar. and the court
will i decide the * case * to-day, 5 alter ' testi

* 'Baby Backmaster was in court in the
; arras of his mother. He looked none the
worse for the slapping received, the marks
having nearly all disappeared. y â¢
. The testimony was to the effect that the
child was suffering from boils on bis little
.body, and A. L. Kennedy, the; defendant,:
said it was for that reason he chose to
slap the child -on ; the face rather J than
spank M.-J"- '= *
I -The defendant, in 'his own behalf, testi
fied that the child was "unruly."
To teach the little Â£ one* how to stop cry
ing, the witness said, he slapped both its
cheeKs and walked away. _
When the baby 4 woula not cease its yells
he returned and slapped it again, so as to
teach it. that punishment must be the
penalty ior crying. ' ,-J ' .'
*â¢ This'was repeated quite 'â  frequently,^ but
Kennedy did not think at the time that
he was inflicting punishment enough to
leave any marks. jJ...
â A Judge Campbell will look further into
matter, and the severity of the punish
ment lie will inflict upon Kennedy, whom
he has virtually declared guilty as charged,'
will depend on the medical testimony he
hopes to secure.

Mrs. Fisher resented her husband's in

She was getting the better of him when
he, in desperation, got three ringers of her

her husband arrested, but would take the

PROTECTION AND REVENUE.
- .â¢">.** â  * ' '.â * 'â -Â».â â -"-â â '> i â¢ * .â¢. *.--.Â».- * '-..-"-.. . .
The tariff measure Introduced into the House of Representatives by the Ways and
Means Committee is defined in its title, "A bill to provide revenues for the Govern
ment and to encourage | the industries of the United States."' It has, therefore, a
double object. It is to be a revenue measure and also a protective measure. These
objects are of equal importance and the bill will be a failure if either is sacrificed to
the other. ' \' '
.The first thing to be considered in the proposed tariff is to provide protection for
American industry. If the duties established for this purpose do not yield a revenue
sufficient for the needs of the Government it will then be time to consider what fur
ther duties on imports or internal taxes are necessary to make up the deficiency. In
no case should duties required to give adequate protection to any interest of any sec
tion cf the country be lowered for the sake of encouraging imports and increasing
revenues. . y â  . A â 
The differences between a protecttve tariff and one designed for revenue are radi
cal. They constitute the whole economic contention between the Republican and
the Democratic party. If we are to have a tariff ', solely for revenue we must -en-,
courage imports, for only upon imports do we collect customs duties. If we are to
have a tariff for protection it is not essential to have imports at all, as such a tariff
will serve its purpose by building up American industry and revenues can be derived
from other sources. â¢ ...1- 'â ' - - *.' - ' . ; â  -
The statement of these general principles is pertinent to the present discussion
because much criticism has been directed against the Dingiey bill on the ground that
it would not yield a Sufficient revenue to the Government. It has not been disputed
that it would encourage industry, promote enterprises, develop latent resources in all
parts of the country and provide work for all who seek It. It is only from the stand
point of a trader, therefore, that the bill can be attacked, and such attacks are
not likely to have much effect on public opinion since the disastrous experience with
the tariff for revenue only. ' '
It is impossible to foresee what amount of revenue will be derived from any par
ticular tariff, since that depends upon the fluctuation of trade and commerce. When
imports are large there is a large revenue, and when they are small the revenue is
small. A deficiency in the revenue can be easily made up at any time by the impo
sition of a duty on some article of import which is not produced in this country.
It is not so easy to make up a deficiency of industry when some great American
interest is sacrificed to European competition. A lack of income on the part of the
Government for a short time is a small evil when compared with a lack of work and
wages among thousands of people.
In considering the tariff, therefore, the principle of protection comes first. Let
us revive industry and provide work for the workers and then we can easily provide
revenues. It is gratifying to note that the first test vote on the subject taken in the
Senate shows that it is upon thes* lines the tariff is to be framed. The motion
of Senator Vest to reduce the duty on borax was defeated by the solid Republican
vote and that of Democratic and Populist Senators whose States are interested in
that industry.
From this vote we may judge what is to come. Democrats and Populists will
vote for protection to their local interests and the Republicans will vote solidly
for protection to all sections and to all industries. We are to have a pro ective tariff,
and it will be our own fault if the protection given to California industries is not
as adequate as that bestowed on the industries of any other section of the Union.
THE HAYEMEYEK OASE.
The sudden collapse of the prosecution
of President Havemeyer of the sugar trust
for contempt in refusing to answer ques
tions put to him by an investigating com
mittee of the United States Senate will be
to most people a complete surprise. No
one expected Mr. Havemeyer would ever
purge himself of contempt by answering
the questions put to him, nor did any one
think he would be sent. to jail for any
alarming length of time; but, neverthe
less, there was a general belief he would
have something like a real trial and that
be would escape by some professional
cleverness w u'ch would increase our ad
miration lor the law without lowering our
respect for th? dignity of the Senate.
Mr. Havemeyer, however, was dis
charged from custody simply because
the stenographic notes of the evidence
of his refusal to answer the ques
tions put to him were lost, or at any
rate, were not produced in court. It
seems that no other evidence than that
contained in the missing notes was per
missible. The facts of the refusal could
have been proven by the Senators who
asked the questions, by the report of the
committee to the Senate that the witness
would not answer, and by the testimony
of persons who were present when the in
vestigation took place. All such evidence,
however, was of no use to the court. The
notes were the thing and the notes were
not there.
The decision will give a powerful stim
ulus to the industry of removing court
notes and legal documents to piac.s where
they will do no harm to accused persons.
Whether this industry will be beneficial
to the public may be questioned without
exciting general indignation. Mr. Have
meyer we note has said "the verdict is
satisfactory to me and to every decent
man in the community." On that also
there will be differences of opinion. On
one point, however, there will be a con
sensus: Mr. Havemeyer is a citizen of
such refining influences that he can not
only refine sugar but bring about a refine
ment of the law that is beyond the reach
of the polari-cope. ,
NATURE'S WONDERLAND.
W. Atlee Burpee, the great Philadelphia
seedsman, is reported in a Los Angeles
paper as declaring that California is grow
ing seeds for the world and surpassing all
other countries in the cultivation of rare
flowers. According to this authority
nearly all the lettuce, onion and celery
seed used in the United States comes from
this State, which is, moreover, beginning
to produce ciulHower seed quite equal to
that of Denmark and Holland, which has
hitherto supplied the world.
Mr. Burpee is particularly desirous of
securing floricultaral novelties. He asserts
that hybridizing in Europe and the East is
the work of man, while in California the
changes in soil and climate seem toco
operate with nature in producing aston
ishing results, quite unknown in the East
and Europe. There are largo profits in
the production of floricultural freaks by
hybridizing and cross-fertilizing. Sweet
pea novelties from the Santa Clara Valley
have been awarded certificates in Paris
and London. Mr. Burpee states that he
paid C. C. Morse of Santa Clara $1500 for
lC6os*Â»eds of the' Pink Cupid sweet pea
and $503 to Luther Burbank of Santa Rosa
for a new rose creation.
It may be j observed in this connection
that the East is coming to admit that
California is In reality the wonderland of
nature. There can be no possible excep
tion to the asseveration that we lead in
floriculture, while our vegetables are
prize-winners wherever they appear in a
contest for size or quality. That California
is the best country on earth for seed
raising id not merely an opinion, but an
established nth. A majority of the big
Eastern' seedhouses obtain their chief
supplies from this State, and the dweller
by the Balboa Sea, in purchasing seeds in
a package bearing the trademark of an
Atlantic Coast firm, may be buying an
article raised within a few miles of his own
door. But the time may not be far distant
when Western enterprise will call a turn
in this matter and bring to California the
profits of packing and : wholesaling, Cali
fornia -eed, which is now shipped away
in carlo i lots to return in packages con
taining lei. than a spoonful each. U- : ,
Neverthe. -as, it is p'easlng to know that
this good Eastern authority is 'apprecia
tive of the virtues of our soil, and that
when he makes use of j superlatives in
regard to our great natural advantages he
speaks the truth.
Persons who are interested in specula
tions concerning the probable candidate
to make the race : for Democracy in 1900

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 28, 1897.
LINCOLN DAY.
In the elaborate preparations which
have ben made for the proper celebration
of Lincoln day and the enthusiasm shown
in support of the laudable project to build
in Golden Gate Park a monument to the
memory of the martyr President a most
-ratifying spirit of patriotism is displayed.
In our National history the character oi
Abraham Lincoln stands pre-eminent in
its rugged grandeur. The world's high,
estimate of him, formed at the moment
of his death, has been increased as his
participation in the great events .of his
time has been more thoroughly studied
and understood. The story of his life
cannot fail to be an inspiration to the
American youth, no matter how humble
his birth or circumstances. It demon
strates to what possibilities a poor boy
may attain in this country if he will but
emulate the example of Lincoln as a lad
and make the beat of his limited oppor
tunities. â¢ -. .f **y
A backwoods schooling was all that
Lincoln could boast of, but he profited by
what he learned, and pursued his studies
long after his schooldays had ended. j He
I was distinct ve'.y a self-made man, and
i how well he wrought, overcoming all ob
| stacles, on the way from the log cabin in
| the Kentucky wilds to the most exalted
| station in the Western hemisphere and to
glorious immortality, is one of the moat
j cherished parts of the history of our in
: separable union of States. ' â :'
The memory of that gentle, firm, power
j ful, merciful, just and wise man, who
seemed to be specially fitted by Provi
j dence to be the agent of the Nation's
i salvation, is one of the dearest heritages
i of this Republic, and we trnst that the
I exercises to-day will be attended by every
' success in their commendable object of
[ wholesome instruction.
THE EXPERT WITNESS.
The analyst who subdivided the genus
liar into three degrees, of which the ex
pert witness was the superlative, had evi
dently read deeply and well the lessons of
experience to be found in the administra
tion of our laws. In every recent case af
feeling large properties and involving
matters of proof resting upon opinion
there have come to the fore on each
side an array of expert witnesses to
testify this way or that according to their
contract of hiring. JryJr-
The fact that the experts have been paid to
testify for the party producing them seems
a trivial circumstance, and the further
fact that their right to the title and stand
ing of experts may rest upon 'their own
discredited evidence in a score or a hun
dred other cases seems equally immaterial.
The courts co gravely along accepting this
sort of purchasable and hence utterly un
reliable testimony, and giving it weight in
the adjudication of important issues of
personal honor and property rights.
There is a judicial . farce enacted on
every occasion when an expert witness is
sworn. The object of administering the
oath to witnesses is to subject them to the
pains and penalties of perjury in case
their testimony upon a material issue
shall be found to be false.
From these dangers, however, the expert
witness is entirely exempt, for the reason
that he only testifies to his opinion of the
fact and not to the fact Itself. It follows
that if experts are to be allowed at all in
courts of justice they should speak un
sworn, in order that the expert liar may
derive no undue credence in the eye of
the superstitious from the solemnity of
the oath.
A NOTEWORTHY BENEFACTION.
The colonization scheme set on foot by
Major Winchell of /the; Salvation Army
bids fair to reach a merited fruition now
that Clans Spreckels with characteristic
generosity has volunteered to locate the
colonists on terms that are most advan
tageous to them on hi.-* sugar-beet lands
in the fertile Salinas Valley. â  There is
now substantial ground for the projectors
to work upon, | and it is \ confidently ex
pected that the pioneer colony will be on
the laud in time to break ground for tbe
coming spring. *""'"'â¢'
T*> afford hundreds of poor families
the opportunity to become independent
and : self - supporting, - to own homes
and r farms, providing / they â  exhibit J. a
proper degree of . industry, is certainly
to confer a most praiseworthy benefaction
on those who have b< en compelled to suf
fer through â¢ enforced idleness. - Mr.
Spreckels has virtually. put life into the
scheme, bringing , it to the standard of a
plain business â¢ proposition, ot- such a
nature * that those who join the -colony
may ;be esteemed > very fortunate. Thus
the ranks , of the . unempo r will be
materially . reduced, and, -with 7\ the ap
proach of 'the good times that will follow
the enactment into law of the relief
measures -: now ~ before Congress, we may
expect in tbe near future to hear no more
of armies of idle workingmen. The noise
of their I. tread will :" have â  given place \ to
the welcome hum of all the wheels of in

WORLD'S GREAiEiT MONOPOLY
Chicago Chronicle.
Standard Oil stock sold this week at 313'^,
almost the highest figure recorded for the
stock of this remarkable: monopoly. This
represents a doubling in value since the
panic of 1892.' In the latter part of that year,
when all other values were on the down grade
and depression lowered everything on the
list, Standard Oil securities began to rise and
tne upward movement continued, until to-day
the capital stock of $97,000,000 is worth the
enormous sum of $300,000,000. And now It is
said that, in order to consummate the pur
chase of certain European oil properties, this
capital stock will be doubled. ,
In 1890 the shareholders of the organiza
tion received dividends of 31 cent, and
already in this year 20 per cent has been dis
tributed. The total amount of dividends dis
tributed in the years from 1893 to 1897. in
clusive, is $104,225,000. This organization
controlling oil fields, pipe lines, coal, iron,
gold, copper, zinc, silver: and lead mines and
railways. is in the hands oi nine men, one of
them, John , D. Rockefeller, owning 51 per
cent of the capital stock. I:, as contemplated,
it secures control of the Russian and other oil
property, It will then have a real monopoly,
perhaps the only one In the world.
A SUPER:,!. 10US MONARCH.
The Czar of Russia is said to, be very super
stitious and to have great confidence in relics.
He wears a ring in which he believes is em
bedded a piece of the true cross. It was orig
inally one of the treasures of the Vatican, and
was presented to an ancestor of the Czar for
diplomatic reasons. The value which the
Czar sets upon the ring, with its embedded
relic, Is shown by the following fact: Some
years ago the Czar was traveling from St.
Petersburg to Moscow. Ho â  suddenly discov
ered that he had forgotten the ring. ; The train
was stopped immediately and. a special mes
senger sent flying back on an express engine
for it. Nor would the czar allow the train to
move until, several hours afterward, the mes
senger returned with the ring. â

just five little words, which, however; seemed
to - please the Abbe present. He had . been
present at the representation of 'Faust,' and
teased me about being a Margaret who could
not speak German. I thought of how I might

LINCOLN ON -.ABOR.
Conditions Have Changed Since the Great
Emancipator's Day.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ
President Lincoln made a most significant
reference to laboring men in his first inaugu
ral address, which I commend to the consid
eration of David Starr Jordan, president of the
Stanford University, and the men for whom
he speaks. Let me give two or three sentences
which refer to what Llncold calls "the effort
to place capital on an equal footing with, if
not above, labor in the structure of the Gov
ernment." He said these words as he entered
upon his duties as President thirty-six years
ago:
"It is assumed that labor is available only in
connection with capital; that nobody labors
unless somebody else owning capital some
how by the use of it induces him to labor."
â¢'Capital is only the fruit of la Lor and could
never have existed if labor had not first ex
isted. Labor is the superior of capital and de
serves much the highest consideration." "Lit
them (those who labor) beware of surrender
ing a political power which they already pos
sess, and whicn if surrendered will surely
close the door of advancement against such as
they and fix new disabilities and burdens
upon them till all of liberty shall be lost."
There are those among us who think we
have come to that pass now, and they might
team to be not far from the truth if some one
will tell us how men get a chance to work
now. How is it in San Francisco? Do not a
few men owning more or less capital hire all
who are at work to-day? This was not tiue
when Lincoln spoke these words to warn us a
third of a century since. Then there was land,
free land, for all poor men, who had a right to
"take up" 100 acres of it and earn the means
to pay $1 86 an acre for it by their work on
the land. â  * ' â 
All such land is gone now, and no man can
"get back to tne land" till he can make terms
with those who had the means (capital) to buy
it up cheap that they might sell It dear in
small lots and thus get great gain if the poor
man c m make the means to pay the price.
And all trades are in much the. same lix as
the land. Can the man who makes shoes sit
down in his shop and with his own hands
make his way against organized capital and
improved machinery?
When A tenuis Ward objected to being
drafted a.-, a soldier during the lf-te war, on
the ground that he was not willing to fight
for his third-rate boarding-house, the jest,
like many another, expressed the profoundest
philosophy. Imperial Rome perished because
her laboring people had nothing left to inspire
patriotism. â  Capital was as indifferent. then as
now to the condition. of the common people.
A century fince a more appropriate illustra
tion of the folly of ignoring the welfare of the
1-iboring people occurred in the French revo
lution which capital and monopoly would do
well to consider. .Out of 4000 millionaires in
this country I only know one, our townsman,
Claus Spreckels, ' who is wise in his genera
tion. , '
Glaus Spreckels is reported as proposing to
place unemployed men and their families on
0000 acres ot land to raise sugar beets for his
factories and to provide shelter for them, giv
ing them a chance to buy the land in small
allotments and pay for them in ten-year install
ments. This is certainly a beneficent work,'
alDeit it is a modified form of feudalism.
But why is it a noble philanthropy worthy of
unstinted: praise for a man of wealth tc do
this thing and reap the profits and gain the
praise, but not wise or well for the Stale to do
a like thing and finish the work begun by Mr.
Spreckels? "Unemployed men are a liability"
which the State must lace, as Governor Adams
has aptly said. We can make them "valuable
assets" by setting them to work for the State
on land provided and made available for them
and their families in the form of colonies by
the State, the homes to be in the center ot the
tract of land, where stores, shops and sehoo.s
will be placed, with the farms on the outside,'
the land to remain the property of theSiate,
from which a small "single tax" would be
paid to the State with a sinking fund to repay
the outlay made on behalf of the colony to
run for a term of years, in this way the State,
too, can do a beneficent work and reap the
profits and gain the praise. -

T An opportunity presents Itself just now that
will never return. Those two blocks are ideal
for park purposes; the sun shines warmer
and lingers longer on ' them than on any
other two blocks on the peninsula, and there
fore it is the most suitable spot to establish a
tropical '.park. Gently sloping toward ; the
east, the full warmth of the morning sun is
.obtained, while the hills that' arise In the
west shelter them from our summer win-is

MiLLiON-DOLLAR MONUMENT FOR
THE PRIVATE
r.a'ttraorj American.
There are many beautiful and costly monu
ments which have been erected to geuerals
and other officers, and also so-called soldiers'
monument*', but not' one monument dis
tinctly erected and dedicated to the enlisted
men of the army and navy of the character of
the monument now proposed to be "erected in i
Washington. â :'â â *-Â»"
Grand Army place was so named from being
the site of the National encampment of the
I Grand Army of the Republic, held in Wash
ington four years ago, and the idea of the erec
tion of the monument there then took shape.
The s-ite is what was formerly known as tho
White House lot, and lies to the south of the
White House, in the neighborhood of the
Washington monume.it. The incorporators of
the association named include thirty well
known veterans of the war. The change in
the administrationâ the election of President
Clevelandâ caused a halt in the proposed
plan, it being thought that Mr. Cleveland
might be inimical' to extending Government
aid toward the ' erection of the monument.
Several days ago the directors held a meeting,
and it is now proposed to go ahead with the
plan, whicu, in the first instance, contem
plates the raising of $1,000,000, and, so far as
may be. by popular subscription, not only
among Grand Army posts, Women's . Relief
Corps, Sons Veterans, Daughters of America,
but from tne public at large. ,"*..'

FLOATED OVER
HERE ON CASKS
Tha Elvenia Came From
Oakland Creek i or Re
construction.
Poolm 1 - Are Trying to Secure
a Beat for Special Serv.ca
to Sausalito.
If Not Successfu 1 , They Will at Once
Establish Headquarters at
Tburoa.
The old-lime schooner Elvenia is again
to be put in cam mission, that is if her
new owner can get her seaworthy. Sne
went ashore at Caspar on April 22 and
during the storm her bottom was badly
damaged and the masts went by the
board. When towed off she was water
logged and In that condition was towed
to San Francisco. Part of her cargo was
discharged off Meiggs wharf and the re
mainder in Oakland Creek. The hull was
put up at auction and ship carpenter
William Campbell purchased it for $100.
The question of getting the wreck off the
beach then came up and Campbell finally
bit upon a plan. All the hatches were
battened down after fifty empty casks
had been placed in the hold. When the
tide came in the schooner rose off the mill
and half an hour later the hulk was in
tow of a tug and on her way to the Mer
chants' drydock.
All went well until the schooner was
within a few hundred feet of Sieuart
street wharf. Then some of the casks
began to leak and she gradually sank
until only her rail showed above water.
Sue did not go any lower, however, and
the chances are that to-day she will go in
the drydock for an overhauling. ..*; "-"J
Ship Carpenter Campbell thinks that
alter spending $1000 on his $100 schooner 1
he can turn her into a $5000 craft.
The poolrooms are in full swing in
Sausaiito and me pool-sellers are more
than anxious to get an early boat across
the bay. The betting on the Eastern
races arrives hereabout 10:H0a. m. and the
bookies want to have it on their boards by
11 a. m. in order to give the public a
chance to place their money.
The San Rafael leaves here at 11:30 a.m.,
so that makes all .he speculators an hour
late. A conference was held with Presi
dent Stetson of the North Pacific Coast
Railroad in regard to a 10:30 a. m boat,
but the latter could not see his way clear
to put one on. Then the bookies secured
the Eliza D as an experiment, and went
across the bay in her yesterday. Leaving
the Clay-street steps at 10:30 A. it they
were at Sausalito shortly alter 11 a. M , and
the odds were posted before 11 :30 a m
The new arrangement is not satisfactory,
however, and t c first of next month will
see all the bookmakers and the plungers
on their way to Tiburon on the steamer
Tiburon on the 11 a. m. trip. Sausa ito
will thus go back to its old-time methods
and Tiburon will have the fight on its
hands.
Some ex-convicts got even with San
Quentin Wednesday night. The steamer
Caroline brought a load of jute sacks in
bales from the prison, and when t. c ship
ment came to be examined yesterday
morning sacks were .missin-.*. - Some
one had gained, access to the wharf, and, \
ripping open one of the bales, had got
away with all he could pack before day
light.
While the thieves were having no
trouble in getting away with the sacks,
several bums were having a good time
with the barrels of wine that came from
Napa on the steamer Z nlannel. They
bored a hole through one of the hogsheads
witha gimlet and drank until they were
drunk. Tney failed to plug up the gimlet
hole when through, however, and this
morning the hogshead was empty. The
Harbor police think that the men who
stole the sacks and the men who tapped
the wine cask are one and the same.
The Zmfandel had last night the most
valuable load aboard that she had taken
to Napa in many a day. On board were
twenty-live hors s, the pick of Adolph
Spreckels' stable. Some of them will be
turned out on the home farm, while others
will be campaigned. The circuit opens at
Napa and after their engagements there
the horses in training will be sent to
Sacramento. Mr. Spreckels will not go to
Napa with his horses, but the chances are
that he will see some of them run at
Sacramento during fair week.
The biggest clamshell bucket in the
United States came down from Antioch
on the steamer T. C. Walker yester.iay.
It is from the big levee dredger Golden
Gat*** and will be repaired here. A dupli
cate of it will be made, as the dre leer will
be constantly at work and the owners do
not want another hitch to occur. All the
ranchers along the San Joaquin are pre
paring for the high water ot next spring
and levee building is the order of the day.
Pryor's silver mine on the water front
has panned out. The divers were ca led
off yesterday and the schooner came back
to tue wharf. There is still $4000 worth of
lead bars at the bottom of the bay near
Blossom Rock, and for every one of them
the Pipsr-Aden-Goodail Company will pay
$7 50. The Vallejo steamer Sunol was
in collision with the **hip Olympia last
March and went down. No lives were lost,
but about $50,000 in bullion went down
with the vessel. The task of recovering it
seemed a hopeless one. but A. E. P.yor,
the superintendent of the concern, struck
upon the plan of dragging with a fleet of
small boats. In this way the treasure was
located and yielded rich â  returns up
to yesterday. The sale with all the
gold in it was first discovered, and
ever since Diver E. H. Dolph has been
digging into the sand for the - silver
bars. Out of 1500 that went down
with the steamer he lias recovered 1150,
and experts like Al White say it is one of
the best pieces of work on record. The
work of recovering the bars could only be
done at high water, which gave the diver
only one and a half hours to worK in.
When it 1-* known that every time the
diver went down he had to lie on the sand
and dig away into the place he supposed
the bars to be it can ea-ily bo seen that
the achievement was a great one. The
P:yor silver mine has been abandoned,
and the old workings are now open for
pre-emption. ,"

CANADA'S INTEREST

Thomas M. O'Brien; the pioneer of the
Yukon, who. owns trading stations at
Forty-mile, Circle City and Klondyke,'re
turned here yesterday, after a two months'
visit to his old home in Canada, and is
staying at the Commercial Hotel. He says
there is great interest at Toronto, Ottawa
and oilier places in the gold discoveries of
Alaska, and says there will be a regular
rush from there to the Yukon.
All kinds of charters are being applied
for. They even want to build railroads,
and" no less than three companies have
been or.anized for that purpose.^" y
"The Canadian Government is sending
in three different survey parties to ex
plore the trails over the summit; from the
head of Lynn Canal. The object is to find
the most feasible route. The Dominion
Government is going to put the. mounted
police on to carry mails as well as to keep
order and prevent smuggling. There will
he station-, where fre>h horses and vari
ous supplies will bo kept.
"I think the Dalton trail will be the one
finally seiect?d. This trail extends for
about 300 miles from the head < f Lynn
Canal to Fort Selkirk, at the head of the
Yukon River. There is grass lor livestock

over the Coast Range of about 2500 feet,
and then it extends through an almost
entirely level country.
"There are to be five engineers in each

"In Canada now they are organizing all
kinds of companies for minim;, building
trails and railroads, and getting charters
for all kind of things, so great is the in
tetestinthat new: country. Charters for
three different railroads from points on
the coast have been applied for. One of
those nroposed railroad* is from the head
of Lynn Canal, on the White Pass; an
other is from Tarkou Pass. The latter
charter is applied for by an American
company, headed by United States Sena
tor Salisbury of Delaware. He has an ex
plorer named Packert, from' Oregon, in
his employ, and he has been laying out the
road. I met Senator Salisbury in Ottawa

FARMERS AND
THE FREE MARKET
The Question of Room
Seems to Trouble the
Commissioners.
Mj:>r Harney Now Suggests a
Pavilion en the West Side
of East Street.
The State Grange Will Report a
Plan After the Jane
Meeting.
The Harbor Commission held an after
noon session yesterday hearing the ex
pressions of representative farmers con
-cernine the froe market proposition.
There were present representatives of the
State Grange, the Fresno County Farmers'
Club and the Petaluma Poultry Associa
tion. A letter was read from ex-Sena. or
William Johnson of Richland, Sacra
mento County, express:*.!*; his regret at
not be ing able to be present.
Douglass T. Fowler,, representing the
Fresno County Farmers' Club, was the
spokesman lor the farmers. "He said, that
half the product of the State in fruit and
Vegetables, eggs and butter, came to this
City. With no -idea' of striking out the
middlemen, it is the wish of the farmers
to tring into -closer relations the pro
ducer and the consumer, ho said. The
farmer desired to send here , a better
product than he ha* been doing, but to do
that a material shortening of the time
between the orchard or . held and the
tables of San Francisco i-i essentia!. The
free market would be a long step in. that
direction by concentrating the produce at
one central point, where its sale may be
readily ' effect* d and quick distribution
follow, instead of necessitating a search
from one end of the water front to the
other on the part of the would-be buyer.
"The interests of the farmer and fruit
grower and thai of the people of the City
are identical,", said Mr. Fowler. "When
the trade of the producer is made profit
able the foundation of the City is we 1
laid. For upon' that the growth of the
City depends. We want to lay our pro
duce down here in the best possible shape.
Fresno County, not far away, is still pre
vented from sending its best here be
cause of the length of time required to
reach the consumer. For that rea-on
fruit is picked while it is green, and when
it is eaten, although it looks well, it lacks
flavor. 2On the other hand, if allowed to
ripen on the tree it is -spoiled when it
reaches here." *
He believed that a market place where
the fruit and other perishable produce
brought into the City could be concen
trated and quickly disposed ot would go
tar toward remedying this state of affairs.
A running discussion between acting !
Chairman Harney and Mr. Fowler fol
lowed concerning the possibilities of the
market. Mr. Fowler in answer to a ques
tion said he did not understand that the
law contemplated or the farmers expected
that a retail market should be established.
The plan as he understood it was to estab
lish a place where farmers might ship j
their perishable p-odnet and where buy
ers might come, inspect it and buy.
Tie question of room was raised, Major
Harney stating Â£ that during certain peri- i
ods fiom 1500 to 1700 tons of such product j
came into the City every day. How could j
it he concentrated; in one market-pi ace, j
the shipments of individuals segregated I
and sold? He was, he sata, heartily in
favor of the free market and he wanted to
get all- the information possible so that i
the commission might act intelligently. "'
Mr. Fowler said that the problem had
been 'met and solved in Chicago and New
York. A carload of fruit is disposed of in
five minutes in Chicago and in New York.
The average is seven minutes by the auc
tion system. With expeditious handling !
there was no need of clogging the market
place. ... * ' * .-â '
Ouj'Ction was' raised by B. N. Row ey,
editor of the, Fruit-Grower, thai' iu there
cities < roost t of :; the fruit was y packed * by
professional packers and was sold by sam
ple. Here the buyer wanted to see every
package, and often both top and bottom
of the package. ;' â¢: * "
Mr. Fowler said that . California fruit
growers were rapidly learning to '"stand
ard' their goods in size Â«nd style of box
packing and goods.? This would ccme all
the faster with the demand of the market.
-It was aureed that the market could not
be established for the fruit crop of this
year, especially > for t hat brought \ to ; the
City hv rail. 'â *r*'A\ market might be estab
lished for that .brought by water. Tue
commission intimated that it would be
attempted anyhow. -.
Mr. Fowler said that Mr. Smurr of the
, Southern Pacific Company had. said to
him as a committee -of : the* State Grange
that the company would transfer the fruit
brought in on cars to any ; place along the
â  water front by barge that is, transfer the
cars; that they would not wait upon the
ibelt road. r ;.?>
The question of space was the one which
troubled the Commissioners. Major Har
ney returned to ; it -again* and again.' VHt
asked if it would not be possib c to build
a larger pavilion on the west side of East
street into t which > the;; fruit might ibe
carried from the boats by, tramway. y'" y ;
y Mr. ' Fowler j said i* he thought % such a
scheme ; might develop * later, but Â£he did
not seem to think it would be necessary
| now, although more than," one "wharf
would probably be necessary to handle it
at present. He expected to see the day
when many wharves would be necessary.
He expected to see San Francisco with a
million inhabitants. With the new com-
peting railroad, with which Fresno and the
San Joaquin Valley were now equipped,
the fruit and vegetable growers had taken
new courage and were preparing to send
their best products to the City and hoped
the City would meet them. >y : -
The Stale Grange will meet on Jnne 7
and discuss the subject fully in the light
of the difficulties presented, and a state
ment will be laid before the Commission-,
ers immediately afterward, giving statis
tics of their needs and giving some plan
for the es tablisbment of the market.

A NEW EXPERT
HOLDS THE BOARDS
Daniel T. Ames Is Now
the Star in the Fair-
Craven Trial.
*Â» â 
His Recital Is Dull and Con
y ducive of Soft and Gentle
Slumber.
A Reaction Has Set in and the Pro
ceedings Ones More R-*vel in
Their Wonted Dullness. .
The Fair-Craven trial has relapsed into
its wonted drowsiness.
Wednesday's excitement during the
hurricane examination of expert Max
Gnmpel and the startling disclosures
therefrom must have been too much of
an effort for this somber, slow-going liti
gation, for when the reaction set in yes
terday the proceedings were duller than
they have been since the celebrated trial
began. The only redeeming feature was
the appearance of a new face and figure
on the witness-standâ that of Daniel T.
Ames, another Eastern handwriting ex
pertâbut even he soon grew tiresome.
This Mr. Ames hails from Elizabeth, N.
J. He relies for his efficiency as an expert
on chirography upon the fact that he is
an artist, a publisher of a penman's jour
nal, and an author of a quartet of books
on the subject of handwriting. Mr. Ames
is venerable in appearanceâ a man of over
60 years of age, white-haired and whis
kered, and not like unto a cricket on his
"pins," to borrow the sporting editor's
favorite term. He is technical in the ex
treme, profound and mystifying.
A glance at the "pencil will or the dis
puted Craven deeds, and he sees all man
ner of curly cues, hobgoblins, footprints
of forgers and bacilli, which, it is safe to
say, the uninitiated layman conld not
discern even with the aid of the Lick tele
scope. When Mr. Ames is testifying it is
difficult for one to disabuse his mind of
the belief that be has by mistake tumbled
in upon a dry lecture on the points of mi
croscopical researches at the Academy of
Sciences. So deep was the gentleman yes
terday, in fact, that even Mr. Foote of the
defense's line lapsed into a dormant state,
and was for the nonce cured of his habit
of interrupting and asking conundrums.
Sympathy was uniformly accorded the
patient jurors. They had orders from
the court to hold in their laps photo
graphic copies of the "pencil" will â the
document upon which Mr. Ames was first
to dilate and in their hands what Mr.
Foote persists in calling "spyglasses."
They were supposed to follow the New
Jersey expert* through his maze of tech
nical wanderings over the disputed will,
and to their credit be it said, they did the
best they could to do it.
But it was awfully wearying. ... Between
their yawns and stretches they would now
and then indulge in a squint through
their, magnifying glasses at ineir
copies, but their very manner indicated
that they were only doing it to keep
awake and to demonstrate that they were
doing sometuing to earn their fees.
In order that the jurors might not be
tempted to steal a quiet little nap now
and then, the attorneys for the air
estate caused their scene-shifter, Mr.
Marshall, to move the several scaffolds
and their suspended charts of enlarged
bromides of the will to a position directly
in front of trie jury-box, and Ames was
compelled to leave the sacred witness
chair and deliver his lecture from the
center of the courtroom.
Ames began with the very first letter
written in the will, and slowly moved his
analysis down the line. Mites of flaws,
slips of the pencil, retouching and paral
lel lines he said he detected, and in each
instance he would illustrate the alleged
defect upon the blackboard. By the time
the morning session was over he had
waded through fifteen lines of the will.
Ames resumed his backing of the will
as soon as the afternoon session was in
augurated. He took up the sixteenth
line of the first page aud, pointing to the
enlarged reproduction of the disputed
document which Scene-shifter Marshall
had rolled into position before the jury,
proceeded to call attention to various
additional so-called retouchings, erasures
and other alleged flaws. Ames paid par
ticular attention to what he claimed were
evidences that most of the words in the
will had : been put together in pieces.
These evidences were described as being
breaks between the letters forming tbe
words. True it was that even on this
magnified, and illumined reproduction
the alleged breaks could not be detected
with the naked eye â at least with the
ordinary juror's nude optic â but Ames
said they were there, and bis statement
had to go for what it was worth. â¢Â«.,
The expert devoted considerable time
end description to a discovery of his,
which he claimed whs important to the
task of tearing asunder the will. This
was an apparent uaevennessof the word-
that, is. a tendency to bob up and down
from the "base line." Some of them
rested cozily and jauntily on the line,
while others of their neighbors insisted
upon being ambitious to rise in the world
and soar. This lack of uniformity in dis
position, quoth the technical Ames, was a
sure indication that the words had been
copied or traced irom a copy.
Ames did not. think that a forger bold
would have sense enough to trace the
words along an even plane while he was
at it
And so the afternoon wore awaytedi
ously, wearily, sleepily. Ames reached
the second page of _ the will and his dis
sertation in monotone continued on, with
nothing new in its disclosures and nothing
interesting in its technical ramifications.
PIERCED WITH A BULLET.
A Presidio Wharf Guard Shoots Into the
Boat of Trespassers.
A warrant for the arrest of Thomas Mc-
Bride has been issued from Judge Joach
imsen's court, the charge being assault to
murder.
McÃride is in the employ of the commis
sary department at the Presidio, but he is
not an enlisted man. His duties consist
mainly in guarding the Presidio wharf and
other pronerty belonging to the Govern
ment in that neighborhood.
Last week McÃride observed A. V.
Scheppleman and C. W. Hawkes, who
Jive at 149 Eighth avenue, push off in a
Whitehall boat in the direction of some
fishermen**, nets be believed they intended
stealing. He ordered them to return and
upon their refusal he emptied his Colts'
revolver in their direction. One of the
bullets penetrated the boat and the occu
pants came near being swamped.

ALEXANDER BOYD
OPENED A SKULL
Interesting Episode in the
Davis Will Con
test.
Experience of a Pioneer While
Mtning on ; t_e Yuba
River.
Mrs. Belle * Curtis Declared to Bs
One of the World's Best
Owen Meredith's famous dictum that
"Civilized man cannot live without
cooks" was vividly recalled in the Jacob
Z. Davis will contest in Judge Coffey's
court yesterday.
There can be no doubt that Mr. Davis
was a civilized man and that appeared to
be one reason why he so highly appre
ciated the cookery of his niece by mar
riage, Mrs. Belle Curtis, to w orn he willed
property estimated to be worth $1,000,000.
She is not a cook in the ordinary, sense, to
be sure, but is evidently an adept in the
divine and gentle art of gastronomy.
That he was equally appreciative of the
handling of his household affairs by Miss
Lizzie Muir is evidenced by the fact that
he bequeathed to her the other half of his
estate, the young women standing on an
even plane of . his approval, according to
the declarations of the document that has
bo en tiled for probate as his last will and
| testament.' - y.â_ ;:_
These interesting facts came out in the
testimony of Alexander Boyd, the lifelong
partner of the late Mr. Davis.
An effort is being made by the relatives
of the late Mr. Davis to prove that the
will is a forgery, and in his questions At
torney George A. Knight declared that he
was seeking for a reason that would satis
factorily explain the action of the decedent
in signing sucu a will, if, in fact, he ever
did sign it.
Of course there were many other en
dearing traits of character and ties of
association as well as relationship by mar
riage, and these were also mentioned by
Mr. Boyd, but he dwelt with particular
stress on the joy and comfort experienced
by the old man irom the ministrations of
the young ladies who were members of his
family circle for so many years and who
were with him when he died.
Mr. Knightâ Mr. Davis had a great affection
for Mrs. Curtis and Miss Muir, had be not?
Mr. Boydâ Yes. He never seemed satisfied
unless they were in the house. -Jy
"Do you know of any reason that made him
thii.k so much of Mrs. Curtis?" -:*â¢*â¢
: "Well, lor one thing, he liked fine cooking,
and she is a splendid cook. I suppose there
isn't a better in the world. At least he
thought so." . - - - r . '
"Mr. Davis kept a servantâ a cookâ
he?" ."-â *
"Why, yes, of course, to be sure; but that
wasn't the kind of cooking he wanted. It was
the fine cooking that she did for himâ the
things he liked. He thought nothing tasted
so good as when Belle cooked it."
'What did Miss Lizzie Muir do to endear her
to Mr. Davis?'
"She fixed everything about the house and
made it pleasant and 'comfortable for tue old
peopleâ for him and bis wife."
Attorney Campbell thought this line of
inquiry had gone far enough and said so,
but the witness evinced no unwillingness
to answer and Mr. Knight persisted.
' "They' humored his whims 'in every way.
didn't they?" ...
"Yes, of course; just as loving daughters
would do."
This reply appeared to please the attor
neys for the proponents of the will more
than it did Mr. Knight, and so another
branch of the case was taken up, bat the
ladies who were thus held up as models of
helpfulness to the old Jpeople with whom
they lived showed that they appreciated
the compliment paid to their home-loving
qualities. " "J :_..':..'> jJ.'J yyjyryyyjr
Mr. Boyd testified that about thirty
years ago his late partner, Jacob Z. Davis,
begaa to take care of Mrs. Belle Curtis and
Miss Lizzie Muir, and about the same
time he ; began to : care .' f or V Mrs. Ed F.
Smith of Sacramento. He continued in
that relationship up to the time of Mrs.
Smith's marriage. Mrs. Smith is a sister
of Mrs. Curtis and Miss Muir. Mr. Boyd
intimateu that he held much the >arae re
gard for Mrs. Smith that Mr. Davis . dis
played toward Mrs. Curtis and Miss Muir
during his lifetime.
:*: Mr. Boyd was asked to tell about the
finding of the will in the copper urn: that
contained the incinerated remains of Mrs.
Davis. He declared that the box or urn
was â¢' never in 1 his office before it was
opened, in this regard contradicting the
testimony of John M. Curtis, who swore
that he took the box first to the office of
Boyd & Davis, and afterward removed it
to his own office when the top was un
soldered and removed by a tinner. : ".J J.
â¢'We met at Mr. Curtis', office by ap
pointment," said Mr. Boyd, ''and the tin
ner was. sent for to do tbe work. * After
Mr. Curtis told me of his thought that
the will might be in the box containing
Mrs. Davis* ashes f I consulted 'â¢:. with ; Mr.
Mastic-, who bad been the attorney for
Boyd & Davis ever since; the Sacramento
flood of 1861, and he said it was Mr. Curtis'
duty to have the box opened if thare was
any possibility for finding .the will there.
" : "George Mastick, Mr. Ryan, Mr. Curtis
and the tinner were there; we were all
â sharp, on time, "said Mr. Boyd. "When
the top was taken off Mr. Ryan was stand
ing nearest? to the urn, and I said, 'Mr.
Ryan, see what's j there.' vHe reached ;in
and Â£ took 'r out ' a piece : of ''â¢', tissue-paper,
which â  contained y the plate '**â¢ from Mrs.
Davis' coffin.,' The paper was removed.
I think : the -plate ,\ was oval in form. I
asked Mr. Ryan what else .was there, and
he said, 'I don't see anything.' so I told
him to look again, which he did, but still
could not see anything. Then I told him
to put his hand in and see if he could find
the will, if it was there. He hesitated and
intimated that he sort of .dreaded to ban
die tue remains of a dead person, so I said,
.'Stand aside and I'll do it myself.' I told
them that I wasn't afraid to touch a corpse
or anything of that kind, and told them
that while I was mining up on the Yuba
I had to saw open the skull of a dead man
to see whether it had been penetrated by
a . bullet or 'not. I didn't hanker for the
job, but there was nobody else to do it,
apd so I went ahead, because I always be
lieve in doing what is required of me, no
matter what happens. v' * '"Hgjapg^Bpj^
"A man had been murdered and we
wanted find out '; how he ?:â¢ was I killed.
Mr. Davis had lost a mule, and hearing
where it was, he went for it.,^On the way
b-ick he saw two men digging a grave ana
saw a corpse in the brush. ; He thought
be would be murdered if he let on that he
saw the corpse, so he punched up his mule
with a stick and hurried to our home

and I, and we found the murderers, who
were just â  finishing;* their work, | and * ar
rested them. We dug up the corpse and
took It back to the camp and began an ex
amination. I had nothing but a coarse
handsaw to saw the skull with, but I knew
how to handle a saw. and by holding it
down was able to make it cut tine, sol
sawed around the skull and lifted off the
top. We found that there was no bullet
in the brain, * and; in handling the gun,
which had one shotgun and one rifle bar

men arrested by us had the gun in their
possession, it further proved their guilt. ;
"We ascertained that the man's death
was caused 'by, a, bullet through .the
body. I don't remember his name. He
wasanOregoniau. The.most of us were
for stringin-r them up, but finally it was
referred to a jury of twelve, and one man
stuck out,* saying he was not willing to
vote for death because one of the men was
demented. He was known as 'Crazy
Jake, : and the juror .who refused to agree
on a verdict said it might have been Jake
who fired the shot. Tne rest of us were
convinced that even if Jake did fire thÂ»
shot it was the other man, whose name I
don't remember, who told him to do it.
Well, at any rate, when we couldn't get a
unanimous verdict we gave the men 300
lashes each and turned them over to a
sea captain, who had made his fortune,
and who promised to take them to the
islands. We r warned the * men never to
come back or they.; would be reported to
the police, and they knew what would
happen." I
During this tragic recital the greatest
attention was. paid to the words of the
witness, and though the testimony was
clearly irrelevant to the issues on trial
there was no offer by Judge, counsel or
jury to interrupt this pleasing excursion
in the realm of reminiscence.
"What did Mr. Ryan finally do in re
gard to ; the urn ,' containing Mrs. Davis',
aabes," asked Mr. Knight.
"He put is hand in and took out. the
will," replied Mr. 80yd. , ;
A long description of the way in which
the will was taken from -the box then
followed.* Mr. Boyd said he" took the in
strument and locked it up in the Boyd &
Davis safe. After that he had it photo
graphed, and then the : will was filed for
probate. ; \ -- y ;
; Quite a spirited colloquy took place be
tween' counsel and witness in regard 10
the possibility ;of Mr. Ryan having put
the will in the box. Mr. Knight said Mr.
Boyd was anticipating his . suggestions.
â¢On, I could see what you were drifting
at," said the witness.

PRESIDENT W. W. STONE of the Lincoln Monument League,
who has taken a leading part in the preparations for the Lincoln
day celebration.
The celebration of Lincoln day in our public schools -"o-day will be one ot those landmarks
that occasionally rear themselves along the current of our National history. Our political
machinery is of such nature that it Is difficult, If not impossible, to divest tho man of the
partisan husk that envelops him. Every President of the United States we have had so far
has had to struggle along laden by party memories.* -* j y,JJ. Ay A yjyJjTl
Abraham Lincoln has had to bear the same burden, mitigated by his terrible end. To-day
he will take bis proper. place, officially, historically, naturally, as the great pivotal point in
our history, perfectly free from tarty handicap. Some people will cavil at this statement of
the case ; it will regarded as strained and harsh. Such people forget that human nature is so
constituted that while we menially appreciate and indorse some grand truth its open expres
sion often startles the consciousness. Be this as it may Lincoln day will henceforth be an
established fact. It will not again occur on the 28 th of May; that time was set merely to
emphasize the organization of the Lincoln Monument League.
There is a leaning all over tne country toward fixing the future Lincoln day on February;
12 as the anniversary of Ivs birthday. 1 have letters on this subject from fifteen States of the
Union. Miss Frances E. Willard, our commander-in-chief of the Grand Army, the Governors
of Ohio, Rhode Island, Illinois and Washington, the State superintendents of : six States, have
all expressed their desire to see the birthday utilized as Lincoln day.
1 aim to make the day not a time for idle recreation and pastime, but a National school
day. when pupil and teacher and visitor may turn back to the eventful and profitable pages of
history recording Lincoln's life, character, services aud pathetic end. It will encourage the
struggling boy, though clad in poverty and rags; it ( will warm trie heart of the lukewarm
patriot, and above all it wiil teach everybody a firm reliance on Almighty God, who strength-,
ens the sinking spirits ana answers the prayers of these who seek him in spirit and in truth.

Explanation.
Tbe arrow files with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath It. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted scow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect coins of equal air pressure; iso
therm", or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hitrh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: --low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded'
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along, the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable:
but when the "low" is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to* the California coast, warmer
weather may hi*- expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK EXCHANGE.
NEW YORK, N. V., May London showed
a more active interest in the stock market to-day
than for a long time. Early quotations for Ameri
can securities , from that center were fractionally
above last night's closing prl es here, and foreign
arbitrage bouses were moderate buyers of stocks.
They bought again at the close of the nay, a cir
cumstance Indicating that they expect further Im
provement in London to-morrow. lhe profes
sional element was inclined to disregard this en
courazlt'g occurrence. It argued that prices have
advance i far enough this week to warrant the
c nfideot expectations of a reaction. Room
traders recovered some of the courage lost yes er
da â¢ and ventured to put out again a part of the
short contracts they have covered during the las-,
three days. 'J he result was a slightly lower ratine
of prices 'for a majority of the list and a decided
falling off in the vo.ume of trans ctions This
last is strong circumstantial evidence at the mo
ment that the majority, of interest in the slock

Chicago. . .
Wheat bulls found little encouragement this
morning, llverpool reported a decline of %d, fol
lowing up Its record of the past week with regu
larity. On account of a holiday there was no
market to-day. Closing English cables added an
other %d decline to that ofthe morning.
Condi. ions favored abort sellers throughout the
session. July opened at 70% c \ to'; 7oc, 'playing
within 1/4 c range for the first two hours. The local
crowd favored a rally, and were a stand-off for the
bears durin.- that time. It became evident that
outside support would not take hold in order to
lift the price; finally a retreat was made atout
noon. Longs began selling oat,' and the market
then started to d op of its own weight. â  < .-.

is a very large short interest in the market, which
would be found bard to cover In case any favor

Continued weakness in Eastern markets, also
soft closing Liverpool cables, turned early buyers
to sellers.
December wheat opened at $1- 22%- â¢ A few
trades were made at $1 22% near tbe close. Mar

; Sentiment changed -quickly since the previous
session from weakness to strength.. December
wheat opened at f 1 2Â°-% and closed at SI 23 bid.'

The demand for wheat was less urgent at this
session. December was quoted at $1 23, against
sales at $1 23% off call. Shorts were disposed to
put out their ii..eÃ again, having been scared in at
the previous session. .*,

business is at a standstill. Prices lor milling are

Not Equal to the Test.
There is a business man in this town
who /is a terror to j stenographers., ' His
amanuensis, who has been with Rim for a
long time,;. was recently taken sick. The
employer mailed a letter to a local busi
ness college to send nim a stenographer
and typewriter.' The business man is very'
particular about r his vocabulary, and
wants everything written juit as he dic
tates it. Therefore, in oruer to test Ibe
newcomer's accuracy,' he,' instead of dic
tating an ordinary ; business -letter, gave
form the following at a rate of sceed that
would do justice to a stump speaker:
'-: "In promulgating your, esoteric cogita
tion or articulating your superficial senti
mentalities and i* amicable philosophical
or psychological observations,' beware of
platitudinous ponderosity.'* Letâ â "
: ; But â ; be "â â  got no further, for the poor
amanuensis broKo his pencil in the effort,
after which he got up, wiped the perspira
tion from , his forehead and quickly left
the office. Philadelphia Record.

Manuel Perreira's Surprise
on Returning Home to
His Ranch.
An Elopement That Had Its Or
igin in the Distant^
Azores.
Takes His Loss Calmly and I; Happy
Ttat His Strong B x Was
Not Taken
Oakland Office Sax Fkaxcirco Call,)
90S Broadway, May 27. )
Manuel Perreira, who owns a little
chicken ranch in Palomares Canyon, has
eiven up all idea of ever finding his young
wile, nishor.-e or his wagon. They disap
peared from his ranch simultaneously
about three weeks ago. and Pe.-reira has
concluded that his wile is happy with
some one else and that his horse and
buggy have cnanged owners.
About ten years ago Manuel came to
this country from the Azores. Like scores
of hiscouhtrym :i he left belli: d a maiden,
for whom he was to send as soon as cir
cumstances would permit. He procured
a Utile plat of land near Hay wards, and
at once set to work to rear chickens and
grow a tie fruit for the purpose of being
able to send home for a young lady to be
come his wife.
His Hit venture prospered moderately,
but several years paired before he was in
a position to fulfill the promise mate be
fore lie left the island in the So ih At
lantic. Finally, however, about two year*
ago, Perreira. being the owner of his
em ill ranch and having a little sum be
side, sent money Lome for ihe purpose of
bringing his intended out here. In due
time she arrived, and at once was mar
ried in the little Catholic church at Hay
wards. BÂ£"tM?
All. went well for about a year and a
half, when some one appeared on the
scene and disturbed their happy rural
life. The stranger had come all the way
from the Azores for the purpose of meet
ing the young wife with whom he was
very friendly prior to ber leaving for Cali
fornia.
After the strancer's arrival discontent
took possession of the young wife, and
gradually her affection for her husband
was alienated. Anout two weeks ago
Manuel came to Oakland to sell some
produce, and when lie returned he found
his wife had gone, and that his horse and
buggy were not in the stable. He bas
spent two weeks trying to recover his
property, and bas now given up the
search.
When telling of his troubles today he
was very philosophical, and said that he
was thankful they had not taken a snug
sum of money which was in the house,
and which his wife could easily have se
cured. He says he intend* to take a lady
for his next wife who will be a littie more
staple in her nature.

The JEgis issued by the class of June,
1897, is by lar the cleverest issue that has
been edited by any class. Its wit is of a
high order, and the personal Â«quibs, which
are prepared in a unique tabulated style,
are decidedly original. The class history
is written by Miss Alice Coffin, and Helen
Cooper has a poem on the class flower,
which is the cornflower. Helen Cooper is
the author of the class prophecy, in which
j are introduced several members of the
class, and it is a clever piece of satire.
All the societies connected with the
school are written ud, and the book is pro
fusely illustrated, containing pictures of
the faculty, the seventy- three graduates,
the debating society, the basket-ball team
and many illustrated joke-, in which the
faculty are very tenderly and discreetly

A BRISK FIRE.
Partial j Destruction of a Dwelllng-
HouiA on Railroad Avenue.
ALAMEDA, Cal, May 27.âThe.two
story dwelling-house 'at* 1657 Railroad
avenue, occupied by L. B. Goldthwaite, the
electric light trimmer for the city, was
partially destroyed by fire about midnignt
last night. Mr. Ooldthwaite was alone in
the bouse at the time, his wife and child
being in the Fast on a visit. He was
awakened , by suffocation from the smoke
ami sprang up to see what was the matter.
When he went out into the hall he found
the stairs leading to the ground floor in
flame.** and burning fiercely entirely cut
t.njr off escape by that route. He at once
returned to his room, opened the front
window, climbed out on a balcony, and
from there leaped to the ground, fortu
nately escaping without injury other than
a severe shaking up from the jump. The
loss to building and furniture together is
about $1000, covered by insurance. Mr.
Goldthwaite had a narrow escape with his
life, as if he had not wakened when he did
he would almost certainly have been suf
focated lo death.

Oakland Office San Francisco Calt.,l
... .,-. "., :â ; y 908 Broad way,*; May 27. J
. Oakland's opera-bouffe highwaymen ap
peared in Martinez this morning and held
up the watchman at the depot, after which
they took his pistol and, handcuffs from
him. *.*â â¢*- â â¢â¢-. . . -*
A description of the men leaves no doubt
in the mind of Chief Lloyd that they are
the same two who held up Officer Boyce
near the City Hall last Monday and took
his pistol from him. The remarkable
feature in both cases is that the men took
snch great risks apparently for nothing.
There was no boodle to be obtained from
either Officer Boyce or Watchman Tag
gÂ«rt at Martinez, and yet the robbers
seemed to be willing to take all chances for
the purpose of disarming an officer.
This morning about 4 o'clock Watchman
Taggart saw two suspicious men at Mar
tinez. He ordered them to stop and asked
them their business. As he was aoout to
arrest them, they each pulled out a pistol
and told him to throw up his hands. He
complied and then they ordered him to
walk along the railroad track and not to
look behind him.
"Soon - after ; the train from Oakland
stopped," said Tagcart to-day, "I saw
two men running up the track. I spoKe
to them ana they told me they wen going
to take the train out. I told them they
could not do that, and when I was about
to arrest them they each produced a gun.
After taking my pistol and handcuffs
from me they told me to walk up tbe
track, and the taller man said:, 'Jack,
we were fools for not standing up tbat
train crew.' When the train came along
tbe men told rae to lie down in the grass
while they tried to get on th train, bat
It was going too fast.
"After making me walk a mile and a
hall from town the men handed me back
my handcuffs and empty pistol and told
me to get back to town.- They- said they
would leave the cartridges along the track
where 1 could get them to-day. y y yy
"Atone time, as we were walking along
the track, one of the men picked up a big
rock and I was afraid he was going to hit
me with it, but he finally dropped it again.
The shorter man kept behind me all the
time, and I did not get a very good look
at him as 1 feared if I looked around I
would get shot. 4 The taller man was about
five feet ten" inches tall. He wore a light
cap, and I think had a small mustache.
Both men looked as 'notigh they had sev
eral days' growth ot ! b?ard. The short
man was about five feet six inches... Both
men were very cool and seemed to be de
termined fellows." y â 
.7 Chief: Lloyd says he has no doubt that
the robbers are the fame men who were in
Oakland, and special efforts have been
made to 'intercept them should they at
tempt to ' return. v Sheriff Veale has sworn
in to-day one dozen citizens as deputies,
and they are: now scouring Contra Costa
County in all directions. -.yyvyrryy.

KILLED CONSTABLE
DENNY CRON IN
Result of a Feud Over an
Arrest by the
Officer.
Shot by James Bryant, an Em*
p'oye at the Race
track.
There Had B_?n Bad Feeling Between
the Two M n for Some â 
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, }
908 Broadway, May 27. J
Denny Cronin, a Deputy Constable and
brother of Constable Cronin, was shot to
night by , James Bryant, an employe at
the racetrack. The injured man's chances
of recovery are doubtful. , , .
| .The shooting was witnessed by but a
few people and was done very quickly
without any preliminary work. Bryant
and Cronin met in front of a saloon near
the racetrack, and after a few words the
horseman shot the deputy.-^ yJ
There has been bad feeling between the
two men for some time. Three weeks ago
Cronin arrested Bryant for disturbing the
peace, and he was sentenced to ten days
in the County Jail. He returned to the
track about a week ago, and this is the
first time he has met Cronin since.
Bryant is only a bo> , 17 years of age, but
is said to have a mean disposition.
The wounded man was at once exam
ined by doctors, who found that the bullet
had entered the shoulder and glanced
down and could not be located. They de
clared that his chances of recovery are
very uncertain. Immediately alter, the
shooting Bryant ran iff, and descriptions
of him were telephoned all around. Ser
geant Hodgkins went at once to the pier
to prevent Bryant from going to San
Francisco, but he has not yet been ar
rested.
McKINLEY'S CAMPAIGN.
Hs Friends Making a Brilliant
Fight for the Post
mastership
in. ' '" n . *Â*.
The Emergency in the Office Changes
the Chances and Aspirations
of Some People.
It seems rather likely that the worthy
uncle of President McKinley, Bsnjimin
F. McKinley, superintendent of Station F
Postofiice, will succeed the late Frank Mc-
Coppin as Postmaster of San Francisco.
The untimely death which has unex
pectedly ; advanced the vacancy to Â» year
before its time has changed much the in
teresting campaign for the office and
makes of more present interest and im
portance a matter which had been rather
resigned to a long course of quiet develop
ments, political and otherwise.
Shorly after Uncle Benjamin McKin
ley returned from a visit to Canton and
the inauguration at Washington his
friends began a quiet but busy campaign
lor him. The petitions circulated about
the City haye already received over 20,000
names, representing over one-quarter of
the voter** of San Francisco. \
J Mr. McKinley. has led a quiet, honor
able and creditable life here for thirty
years, represented a part of the City in
the Legislature in the past, and has estab
lished a wide acquaintance and no ene
mies. His iriends have constantly ad
vanced the effective argument that he has
been twelve years in the local service,
knows well its ways; and need.*-, and that
bis appointment would be in the nature
of a civil service promotion. It is urged
tbat, with his well-known ability, char
acter and worth, the incident of his being
a relative of the President should not be a
wÂ»ll across his way.
In this campaign not only have the citi
zens constituting "the masses'* readily
signed the vast petition which the Presi
dent is expected to note, but so has nearly
every business bouse in the City. Most
of the banks and practically all of the
wholesale houses and big manufacturers
are on record as asking for the appoint
ment.
Ex-Postmaster Samuel W. Backus has
been the only other aspirant for a $6000
office who has boldly said so far that he
wanted it.
The Postoffice will cause much bustling
and telegraphing in the next few days,
and developments will come early. Mean
while, the great popular petition grows,
and next week it will be before President
McKinley.
The new : Postmaster will probably
assume office for convenience at tbe beein
ninu of the fiscal year, July 1. Meanwhile,
Assistant Postmaster Doyle has been
selected to run the office by Frank Mc-
Coppin's bondsmen, Adam Grant, W. F.

Mrs. Kate Malcomson was convicted by

woman went into a violent fit of hysterics
and was dragged screaming from the court
room to tne City Prison. As she contin
ued her scroams she was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital in the patrol-wagon and
strapped down on a bed in the female
ward. She kept up her screaming till she

BUDD NOW HAS
THE STAR PART
The Majors Case Cited to
Him by Durrant's
Attorneys.
Ex-Convict Bryant Comes to the
Front With Another Weird
Story.
This Time It Is a Yarn of Bribery
by Two Women to Testify Against
Pastor Gibson.
There is plenty of speculation going on
about the probable action of Governor
Budd in tbe Durran t case. Chief of Po
lice Lees and District Attorney Barnes
leel confident that he will not interfere to
delay the execution, which is set for two
weeks Irom to-day. Attorneys Deuprey
and Dickinson deciaie that with all the
facts they have put before him he will al
low them to try the vVilliams case.
This phase ot the matter recalls the his
tory of the famous Lioyd L. Majors mur
der trials in San Jo.-c some dozen years
ago or more. The two cases are much
alike in their general outlines. Like Dur
rant, Majors was charged with two mur
ders. On March 11, 1883, he robbed and
murdered William P. Renowden, near
fcauta Clara, and got a sentence of life im
prisonment.
There was another charge of murder
a^fiust Majors, the killing of Archibald
Mclntyre. Public sentiment against the
condemned man ran very high, and in
obedience to popular clamor the District
Attorney resolvod to press the second
cnarge. Through his attorneys a change
of venue was granted to Alameda County,
with the result that Majors was again con
victed of murder and mis time sentenced
to be hanged.
To escape the death penalty Majors ap
pealed to the Supreme Court on the
ground that he was legally a dead man
after tne first sentence and that his life
could not be put in jeopardy twice for the
same offense, the two crimes being com
mitted at tne one time. The appeal was
denied and the law laid down that the
murder of two persons by the. same per
son, constitutes two offenses, for each of
which a separate prosecution would lie
and conviction cr acquittal in one case
does not bar prosecution in the other.
Durum t- attorneys are very anxious to
invoke this legal precedent just at present.
Taey declare that they have evidence that
would clear the condemned man of tbe
Williams murder. The Majors precedent,
t:.ey declare, in its practical interpreta
tion, forever shuts oft any hope of Durrani
securing ms irrc-uom even were tbe Gov
ernor to commute the present death sen
tence. There would he nothing to pre
vent the authorities Irom pressing the
second case, even were the prisoner par
doned now, or in twenty years from now,
because an indictment for murder is not
affected by any statute of limitation.
Governor Budd le.t for Sacramento yes
teiday morning. It is probable that he
may r ach a uecision this afternoon â in
any event to-morrow. All the efforts of
Durrant to secure a personal interview
were unavailing. Tbe Governor was
averse to visiting San Quentin, owing to
pressure of Dusiness. Both the prosecu
tion and defense will rest on their arms
until he is heard lrom.
William T. Bryant, who from long
range has been doing his best to interject
some new interest in the case, tin*** lime
declares be was offered $5000 by two
women to swear that he saw Pastor Gib
son carrying Blanche Lamont's body into
the belfry of the Emanuel Church." The
names of these women are given as Mrs.
Henrietta Bigsby and Hester Hicks, and
Bryant adds that they instructed him to
write to Mrs. John Martin for transporta
tion to California. These statements he
conveys to Chief of Police Lees in a
ramoiing letter, which arrived yesterday.
The letter bears the date of May "24 and
appears to have been written irom the
Soldiers' and bailors' Home at Monte
Vista, Colo., of which institution Bryant
is an inmate. It is as follows:
I. W- Lees, Chief of Police. San Francisco, Cal.â
Pear Sir: In ie*,ard to a new witness for
Du'HÃt. I beg to say that I have bjen offered
$5000 to swear that I was in the Emanuel
Baptist Church at the time the murder was
committed and that I saw ii and that the mur
derer whs the Rev. J. George Gibson but 1 will
not do so for 1 know nothing whatever about
it. , 1 never to my know. edge saw Rev. J.
Georj-e Gibson or Durant either but I have
had the offer from Mrs. Henrietta Blgsby and
Hester Hit Ido no. know either of thes wo
men but they seem to know me very well they
instructed sue to write to Mrs. Isabella J. Martin
for transportation to California. I done so
IQI failed to receive it. I receiv d several let
ters, but no transportation the people out
here nave been trying to make me swear to a
budget of stuf they seem to think that I have
to do as they wish they think Durant is not
guilty LUi that is nothing to do with me for I
no nothing about it. Destroyed 23 letters
which I have received In regard to this matter
but if I receive any more I will mail them to
you. Keep this out of the papers till 1 can
locate Henrietta Bigsby and Hoster Ricks. I
am most resnec'fully
The commander of this Soldiers Home seems
t ii very much interested in this affair, and
I think that his interest is for money, for
there's a bis scheme under way to entirely
exonerate Durrant and put all the blame on
UÂ»v. Gibson, rind Colonel S. M. French, the
commander ot this place, is making a terribie
roai about h, aid the editor of a small paper
that is published nt Monte Vista has all sorts
of lies published regarding what I know they
are in communication with parlies .in San
Francisco, just who they are and what it is
aboui.'l cann>t tell, they are continiouslv
after me to make afadavits and make them
st.'ong, as they term it, Dleaje let me know
what io do and just how to work this tning
and I will put all these would-be bribers into
your hands in less than a month from this
date. W. T. Bryant.
Chief of Police Lees knows nothing of
Mrs. Bipsby nor Mrs. Hicks, and since he
discovered that Bryant is seven times an
ex-convict the Chief is not inclined to
place any faith in his assertions.
Mrs. Martin never heard of the two
women Bryant says offered him the bribe.
On Monday last she wrote Bryant for
more details of his sensational assertions
concerning Pastor Gibson. There was no
talk of transportation to this State in the
letter, and Mrs. Mania declares she never
thought of such a thing.
All in all it looks as if Bryant, tired of
penitentiary notoriety, was seeking a new
avenue of fame for himself.
Mrs. Martin has billed herself to deliver
a lecture in Metropolitan Temple on Fri
day evening of next week on the case.
DURRANT'S PRISON LIFE.
Many Opportunities of Suicide
Were He This Way Dis
posed.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Cal., May
â Theodore Durrant, the murderer of
Blanche Lsmont, who is confined in the
State's penitentiary awaiting the hour of
execution, now but fifteen days distant,
has it within his power to commit suicide
at any time. The narrow and gloomy
cell where he is locked up is not fur
nished with more than a cot, a table and
a lamp, but with the: latter he could at
any time end his life. The young medical
student is familiar with the human sys
tem, and were be to break: ihe lump
chimney he could easily sever an artery
with a piece of the glass and bleed to
death before being discovered.' . J,
During the night a guard makes trips

along tbe balcony upon which the cells of
the condemned prisoners lace, and five or
six times during the night the blue-coated
sentinel peers into the stone-and-iron ceil
which is numbered 21. Between these
visits there is of necessity a lapse of time
sufficient in length to allow a man to
bleed to death before beintr detected. Yet
at the prison the authorities say they
have no fear that Durrani will take his
own lifeâ that he is not built that way;
that men seldom make the attempt until
all hope is jjone and the terrible disgrace
of dying on the gallows confronts them as
a certainty.
With Durrant this is not so. He yet
hopes be will receive a reprieve. But the
broken glass method is not the only way
at his command by which he can end his
life. The blankets on his cot or the
striped suit on bis back could either be
utilized to strangle himself and thus cheat
the gallows. Soon these opportunities
will be beyond his reach, for once he en
ters the death-chamber he will be unable
to die by bis own hands. The death
watch is never more than a dozen leet
away from the inclosure where the con
demned man is confined, and the duty
and the purpose of the death watch is. to
thwart any. such attempt.
To-day Durrant exercised for a brief
time in the prison yard, under the con
stant surveillance ot the guards. His
mother also visited him, and the scene
between mother and -on was as usual
most affecting. Durrant loves his mother,
and Mrs. Durr.tnt has the utmost faith in
the innocence of her boy.
They conversed for a time in whispers.
What was said is known to them alone,
but that Mrs. Dnrrant whispered words of
comfort and encouragement could be no
ticed in the prisoner, who kissed her
fondly when she left.
Among the prisoners in murderers' row
Durrant does not seem to have any spe
cial friends. He has of late kept more to
himself when allowed the freedom of the
yard, and though he speaks to all he has
no especial one whom he treats with more
consideration than another.
BEET COLONY APPROVED
Colonization Committee Dis-
cusses Ciaus Spreckeis'
Proposition.
Appreciation Expressed of His Gen
erous Attitude Toward the
Proposed P an.
At a meeting of the sub-committee of
the citizens' colonization committee, held
yesterday in Chamber of Commerce Hill,
William M. Bunker made â  report on be
half of the committee which visited Clans
Spreckeis on Wednesday.
Mr. Bunker said that Mr. Spreckeis was
quite in sympathy with the movement to
establish a colony, and would widen the
scope of the experiment should it prove a
success. Mr. Spreckeis, however, wanted
the project handled in a business manner,
and thought that a tract of 600 acres would
be large enough for the experiment.' In
case the experiment proved a success the
control of the land should pass from him;
otherwise it s. ould remain in lis hands.
Mr. Spreckeis had told Mr. Bunker that if
the experiment proved a success he would
be willing to sell the land at tbe price it.
cost him,. without making any profit on it.
During the general discussion that fol
lowed the report, George E. Butler, George
H. Maxwell and other* expressed warm
appreciation of Mr. Spreckeis' attitude to
ward the project, and hia disposition to
meet the committee more than half way.
In his report Mr. Bunker laid emphasis
upon the fact that the prosperity of the
City depended largely upon the successful
colonization of the interior, and that if the
present project proved an indnstrial suc
cess, other colonies would be established
upon similar line-. The natural auvau
laces of soil and climate which California
offered for sugar-beet culture, he declared,
offered a good held for colonization.
Remarks were also made by H. 11. Sher
wood, Will S. Green, Mr. Samuel and Major
Wincuell. .- The committee will take fur
ther action after a formal proposition has
been received from Mr. Spreckols.
EETREAT TO THE WALL
The Supreme . Court Passes .Upon What
Constitutes Self- Defense. '
The Supreme Court, has ordered new
trial of the case of Frank A. Lewis, who
was convicted of .manslaughter for killing
his brother-in-law,- William H. Farrell.
Lewis and his wife lived on a mountain
ranch in Shasta County, and from the tes
timony Farrell had frequently threatened
to kill Lewis on account of trouble grow
ing out of money matters. The trouble
that caused|the fatality was j started by
Farrell telling his sister that one John
Miller had .--aid that Lewis had stolen
hogs. The day after this story was cir
culated Farrell went to Lewis' house and,
after renewing the quarrel, the former
picked up an iron singletree and threat
ened the latter.
Lewis then shot Farrell with a rifle, the
buJet . striking him in the body. After
the shot the Lewis family put Farrell to
bed and sent for a doctor. While Mrs.
Lewis whs out of the room Farrell cut his
own ' throat â¢ with bis - pocket-knife. The
defendant's plea ; was self-defense. The
point of the prosecution was that L?wis
did not "retreat to the wall," as the law
books declare that one must in order to be
justified in taking human life.
The Supreme Court does not believe
that an assailed person is bound to flee
from his Â own house in order , to avoid
violence 4 even though a retreat may be
safely made. The lower court in instruct
ing the jury on this point committed an
error, and for this rea-on tbe judgment
was reversed and a new trial ordered.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 28, 1897.
COOKED BREAD
WITH ARSENIC
Fatal Mistake in a Dis
ordered Ranch
Kitchen,
Fred Beeson, the Cook, Is Dead,
and Others May Fol
/ low Him.
He Thought the Poison Was Baking
Powder and He Used Three
Teaspoonfuls,
Oakland Office San Feancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 27. J
A new cook at the Morse ranch put
three teaspoon fuls of arsenic into the
bread he was making last night thinking
It was baking powder and to-night be is
dead, another ranch hand is dying and
some others are sick, though not seriously.
Tuesday last Fred Beeson from Ban
Francisco went to work on the Morse
ranch as cook. He was well recommended
and was a very steady man and he went
to work in the kitchen at once.
Like most ranches the various articles
in the kitchen were somewhat misplaced
and Beeson, being: new, had not time to
examine everything and get it in order
when he made the fatal mistake.
Last night the cook made a batch of
Dread. Beeson saw a bottle containing
white powder, and after examining it he
concluded it was baking-powder. He put
three teaspoonfuls in the dough and this
morning baked the Dread. He ate some
of it and so did the other hands.
Soon after eating the bread Beeson was
attacked with spasms and vomiting, and,
as it was seen that his sickness was seri
ous, a man was sent to Sunol, three miles
off, for a doctor. When ' Dr. Webster ar
r ved he saw at once that the man had
been poisoned, and on questioning him it
was learned that he might have used tbe
wrong bottle in the kitchen in making the
bread. An examination showed that the
tile contained arsenic, and that there
was enough in the bread to poison a score
of people.
Beeson grew worse, and this evening he
died. Another band, whose name could
not be learned, is also deathly sick, and is
not expected to live. Everybody else who
had eaten of the poisoned bread was
treated with emetics, and, although sev
eral are ailing, it is not believed that any
dangerous results will follow.
Beeson's body was taken in charge by
Deputy Coroner Taylor of Livermore, aud
an inquest will be held to-morrow. The
ranch is owned by Harry N. Morse, ex-
Sheriff of this county.

There was. a large attendance of em
ployes of the San Francisco Postoffice de
partment at the United States Circuit
Court room last evening. The men were
called together to express their senti
ments of sorrow touching the death of
master Frank McCoppin. y j
The meeting was called to order by John
L. Meares, superintendent of carriers. In
calling the meeting to order Mr. Meares
spoke of Mr. McCoppin as the kind and
considerate friend of all the employesâ a
man who had respected the principles of
civil-service ' reform which " postal em
ployes regarded as almost sacred.
B. L. Hardesty reported that the floral
committee had ordered a decoration of
flowers representing a stamped envelope.
The dimensions of the piece are 5x3 feet.
The committee had also directed that cut
flowers should be placed at the tomb
twice a week for two months. The report
was adopted.
D. S. Richardson, from the committee
on resolutions, presented the following re
port, which, was adopted by a rising vote:
Whereas, It has pleased the great Architect

IT AMUSES THE
LOCAL CYCLISTS
They Are Not Alarmed at
League Races at Santa
Monica.
May Retaliate by Placing the
Southern Track on the
;;';'; Blacklist.
Comparison Between the Strength of
the N w Organ zation and the
One That Is Passing.
The announcement by telegraph from
New York that the management .of the
bicycle track at Santa Monica has signed
an agreement with the League of Ameri
can Wheelmen to permit no races there
except under L. A. W. sanction is vastly
amusing to the leaders of the California
Associated Cyclists.
They laugh still more heartily at the in
ference drawn by the correspondent who
sent the dispatch that the signing of the
agreement marks the weakness of the se
cession movement and that the league
will soon be in tbe ascendant again.
R. M. Welch, who has been largely in
strumental in the phenomenal growth and
success of the new California power in
racing matters, said yesterday that far
from showing any waning of the powers
of the cyclists it shows the weakness and
supineness of the league.
"Six months ago," he said, "any track
which had been listed as the Santa Mon
ica track was by the league would have
found it impossible to get a sanction, even
though its management agreed to hold
nothing but L. W. W. meets. Now the
league is only too willing to make any
sacrifice of its pride to get a place where ii
can hold a aeL'^lljjf J_^|UMm____^__j_BÃ^
'"Take for instance the case of the Beck's
Hot Springe track, near Salt Lake. Sev
eral years ago the .proprietor, who had
' built a splendid track at an - expense of
$20,000, offended the league in some slight
matter. I think it was because be adver
tised a two days' meet inlOctober, lÃ9s. and
only ran one day because the attendance
was so small as not to. pay expenses.
"He was blacklisted and has never been
able to use bis track since. The league
would not give sanction to any club that
hired it, and even went so far as to refuse
to give permission to race to a man who
proposed -to buy it and run it under his
own management. In the face of this the
Santa Monica people are taken off the
blacklist simply because tbe league is glad
to have at least one leg to stand on in Cal
ifornia, y Jr
"We do not know, of course, that* the
management at Santa Monica h*-s signed
any agreement of the kind, but if it has it
will get a ; notice from the Associated
Cyclists tbat it will receive no future sanc
tions from the California organization.
Perhaps the managers will realize the
force of this argument when the league in
California is absolutely abandoned *by
those who are now trying to revive it.
"It is all nonsense to say that the
league has any power left :in California,
and our books will bear me out. .Since
the California Associated Cyclists organ
ized there has not been one league meet
held in . California. , On the other hand,
