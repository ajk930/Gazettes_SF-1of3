CHARLESTON, S. C, Feb. 8. â The
warships New York, Maine, Columbia,
. Amphitrite and Marblehead arrived off
Charleston bar to-day after a terrible ex
perience with the storm which swept up
the south Atlantic coast Fr'day and Sat
' urday. The cruiser Columbia and the
battle-ship Maine were sighted from Sulli
vans Island early in the forenoon, and
the flagship New York, the monitor Am
phitrite and the cruiser Marblehead
steamed inte view later, the flagship being
the last of the squadron to reach an
anchorage to the north of the Charleston
lightship. All five of the vessels are now
at anchor about two miles off the bar.
Admiral Bunce's fleet ran straight into
â¢ the teeth of a terrible storm Friday night.
The warships were forty miles off the
North Carolina coast and well below Hat
teras, and while the officers are, as usual,
unwilling to discuss their experiences it is
known that both ships and men were in
great peril. When the fleet was visited by
a representative of the United Associated
Presses this afternoon it was learned that
the actual loss consisted of four lives,
eight men seriously injured and minor in
juries to almost all of the vessels them
" selves. The battle-ship Maine had seven
- ' of her men overboard, three of them losing
their lives. The Marblehead lost one man
I kilted and six injured. The killed on the
i Maine were:
i L. C. Kozel, apprentice, dashed to death
\ against the turrets and body lost at sea.
Jobn Brown, seaman, washed overboard
â  and drowned; body not recovered.
A. B. Nelson, private United States
- marines, washed overboard and drowned ;
body lost.
The Marblehead lost Ship's Carpenter
Strawhat, who was dashed to death by
. the sea. His body was saved and buried
at sea Sunday.
Seven of the carpenter's gang, who were
at work on the sea anchor, were hurled
against the superstructure of the snip by
. the sea and more or less injured. Their
names are: Dennis Royan, blacksmith ;
Charles Osborne, shipwright; Prentice
Bcanriiand and Regan and Hicker,
K plumbers.
Hicker sustained a compound fracture
of the skull and his condition is serious.
Arrangements have been made for ;
placing all of the injured seamen in the I
Murine Hospital here and they will be
â¢ . transferred from their ships to the shore
' to-morrow.
The New York, the Columbia, the Am
phitrite and the Maine were off the coast
below Hatteras and about forty miles out
when the storm began to gather Friaay
night. The admiral signaled- from the
New York for the ships to stand together.
The storm was blowing from the south
east. It steadily increased during the
night and the four ships were separated.
Bo heavily did the New York roll that the
big eight-inch guns in the turrets were
. lashed down with heavy hawsers as a pre
caution. During the storm a heavy sea
rolled over astern and the aft companion
way was flooded with water, which went
' down into the officers' quarters. The gun
ports and torpedo tubes also let the water
in. There was plenty of water inside.
The boatswain, William Anderson, while
'â¢V"{ n * ne forward deck, was struck from his
"w *?t by forward deck, was struck from his
> t by a sea and injured by being dashed

. forward quarter deck, lost his footing and

trews were recently sent ashore from warships of European powers to extinguish fires that had raged for days at Canea. the capital of the disturbed island. â¢
It was reported yesterday that these same ships-of-war had begun a bombardment of Canea as a warning to the insurrectionists. * ~ ** *
The San Francisco Call
was about to go over the side when he
managed to seize a life line and save him
self. When the sea was shipped astern
the sounding apparatus was knocked to
Hinders and one of the officers nearly
clashed over the side.
When morning came the Maine was
sighted and spoken. The battleship, it is
believed, had the most trying experience
of the fleet Friday night Prentice Kozel
was struck by a terrible sea and his life
knocked out of him. The rushing waters
carried his body overboard. Two men i
jumped after him as he was being carried
away. They were Seaman John Brown
and the marine Alexander Nelson. In
trying to save their messmate they lost
their own lives for they, too, were carried
out into tbe mountains of black water.
Charles Hassell was washed overboard at
the same time.
When these four men went overboard
William J. Creelman, landsman, was
standing on the poop deck. He saw the
upturned face of Kozel floating by. Creel
man dove over the stern and struck out to
save him. In the meantime two life buoys
had been thrown over. Hassell got one of
them. Brown, Nelson and Kozel disap
peared and the brave Creelman was strug
gling far from the buoy intended for him.
Hassell saw him and reached him in time
to save bis life.
The Maine was brought around in the
storm and a lifeboat lowered from the
starboard. Naval Cadet Gherardi was put
in command with six men. The boat got
only a few yards from the ship when she
was overturned, and seven more men were
in the water. The men were rescued with
life lines. The lifeboat was lost, as were
one or more of the ship's boats. These
were all torn from their davits by tbe
heavy seas.
The Amphitrite, Maine, Columbia and
Marblehead were sighted in the morning
in the order mentioned. The Marblehead
was laboring heavily and tad out her oil
bags.
Grave fears had been entertained for the
Amphitrite, but she rode out the gale and
as far as can be learned lost no life. On
board the Maine a board of inquiry re
ported on the loss of the three men. They
highly commended Creelraan's brave at
tempt to rescue Kozel. He will be recom
mended for a lifesaver's medal of the first
class.
The Columbia. Marblehead and Amphi
trite came down the coast together after
the storm. The reason the New York did
not arrive until this afternoon is explained
by the fact that she turned back and went
almost to Hatteras looking for the moni
tor. The Marblehead came up to the city j
this afternoon and arrangements were
made for putting her injured sailors in the
Marine Hospital here. .?.* â¢
Exactly what amount of injury the vari
ous vessels themselves sustained during
the storm cannot now be stated. The of
ficers say their ships behaved splendidly,
but it was apparent even to a casual ob
â¢ server that the vessels had received rough
| usage at the hands of the hurricane. It is
1 practically certain, however, that , none of
i .m has been seriously injured, and it is
j not probable that the maneuvers will be
seriously interfered with or retarded by
the terrible experience through which tbe
fleet has passed.

rumors of a massacre in Crete were un
founded. It was true there had been
some firing there, but the loss of life had
been small. During the firing, he said,
the Turkish troops are reported to have
conducted themselves in an exemplary
manner, and there was no plundering.
Curzon said that 5000 refugees had em
barked from Canea and that place was
now perfectly quiet. As there had been a
scarcity of food in Canea the admiral in
command of the British Mediterranean
. quaaron had sent a troop ship with bis
cuit and meat sufficient to feed 600 per
sons for a fortnight. Two thousand refu
gees were on board the British warship at
Canea, Curzon said, and the last of the
fugitives were taken off by the Greek

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 9.â A pri
vate message was received in this city late
la__ night stating that two masked rob
bers held up the Santa Fe westbound
train No. 1 at a point a few miles from
Peach Springs, Ariz.
The train was stopped by means of a

volver in the bands of one of the robbers,
who ordered him to keep quiet.
The other robber then uncoupled the
â  mail and express car and with his com
panion got aboard the engine and ordered
the engineer to run up the road a short
d stance. Here the train was stopped
and the robbers proceeded to open the
door of the mail car.
; The door was opened by a mail clerk,
j who with a revolver shot one oi the rob
bers, killing him instantly. The other
robber, after grabbing a bundle of regis
tered letters, made good his escape.
The dead robber was taken to Peach

CUBAN INSURGENTS
DEMAND FREEDOM
Oa No Other Terms Will They
Meet Propositions From
Spain for Peace.
It Now Seems Certain That Captain-
G neral Weyler Is Soon to B.
Recalled.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. B.â A dispatch
to the Sun from Havana says: Gomez
has issued a proclamation to the sugar
planters of the island and especially to
those of tbe provinces of Santa Clara and
Matanzas, copies of which have been pri
vately circulated in Havana.
. He recalls the earlier decree of the Cu
ban Government and his military orders
forbidding the grinding of sugar cane, and
adds that be is resolved to enforce those
edicts, and all the more rigorously now
that General Weyler permits the manu
facture of sugar in some districts.
He adds tnat in some places the Cuban
army may be. lenient when no doubt ex
ists tbat the work of the sugar estates is
more profitable to the revolution
than to the Spanish Government; but he
says that the principal strength of Spain
is in the resources of Cuba's foil, and the
patriots are obliged, therefore, as an ex
pedient of war, to prevent the raising of
crops.- ..}â Â».?._.
; All estates preparing to grind and all
those which have begun to do so in diso
bedience to : the Cuban decrees will be
wholly destroyed.
General Gomez concludes by declaring
that the responsibility for the poverty of
the island rests upon Spain, and promises
a speedy triumph of the revolutionists.
It is well known that General Gomez
rejects the the reforms proposed by Spain
and says that Cuba's struggle is for
nothing less than independence. He says
that only on condition that the Cubans
would not accept any Spanish proposals
short of absolute freedom of the island
did he accept command of the army. It
is certain that even should Martinez Cam
pos or Azcarraga or any other Spanish
general come here to ; replace Weyler,
Gomez would not pay the slightest atten
tion to their proposals of peace.
The pacification of the province â¢of
Pinar del Rio looks rather sickly, in view
of the fact that a train at Taco, carrying
Spanish . soldiers and provisions, was
blown up with .dynamite yesterday by
the Cubans.* In the province of Havana
I and at the very gates of the capital the
_ insurgents are concentrating large forces,
which threaten a new attack on Guana
bacoa.
Delegate Palma of the Cuban Junta to
day received a letter frora President Cis
neros of the Cuban republic. It was dated
January 12, at Santa Teresa. Official news
was received by General Gomez of the
death of General Maceo and young Gomez.
Counsel for General Carlos Roloff and
Senor Jose Luis, who have been indicted
for conspiracy in aiding a filibustering
expedition" to Cuba from Baltimore in
1895, bas waived all formalities for his
clients removal from this city and they
nave given security for their appearance
for trial in Baltimore February 16.
LONDON, Exu., Feb. B.â The Times'
Madrid correspondent telegraphs that the
Spanish Government considers the di
viding of the civil from the military com
mand in Cuba as preliminary to the recall
of Captain-General Weyler. . .*
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. B.â Consul-
General Lee telegraphs the State Depart
ment that Correspondent Scovel, arrested

DR. NANSEN HONORED.
The Explorer Presented With a Cold
I Medal by the Prince of Wales at
a Reception.
LONDON, En_., Feb. 8 âThe Royal
Geographical Society held a reception to
night in Albert Hall in honor of Dr.
Fridjof Nansen, the distinguished Arctic
explorer. Sir Clements Markham, the
president of the society, presided, with the
Prince of Wales sitting at his right hand
and the Duke ot York at his left.
Dr. Nansen delivered a lecture describ
ing the voyage of the Fram and telling of
his adventures in the far North. He said
that the object of his expedition was not
to discover the north pole, but to explore
the unknown region in its neighborhood.
Upon the conclusion of the lecture, the
Prince of Wales presented to Dr. Nansen
a special gold medal voted to him by the
Geographical Society. The recipient, in
a few well-chosen words, expressed his
thanks for the honor accorded him.
The audience was a most exclusive one.
Despite the enormous capacity of the
building the members of the press were
all provided with facilities for reporting
the lecture, and there is a very strong
suspicion that it was desired that the
newspapers should have a verbatim re
port. All of the/arrangements were of the
"hole-in-the-corner" character, and tbe
general public is resenting the manner in
which Dr. Nansen's publishers are reserv
ing his exploration.
Dr. Nansen's reception compares badly
with that accorded Henry M. Stanley
upon his return irom Africa. Then Dr.
Nansen's agent has only the slightest
knowledge of the American press and its
insatiable demand for news. The conduct
of the explorer's campaign Here gives the
impression that the object of the expedi
tion was simply to make money and that
th*** benefit to science was a small con
sideration, especially as Dr. Nansen has
declared that he will not go on; another
expedition.

TO NAME A COMMITTEE
OF FIFTY.
An Important Meeting With
Jones and Mascherini of
the Local Society.
ASSOCIATION TO BEGIN WORK
AT ONCE.
There Will Be Pnblic Speaking and
Efforts to Raise a Fund for
the Patriots-
President Jones and Secretary Mascher
ini of the Cuban Sympathizers' Society of
San Francisco were closeted with Mayor
Phelan for an hour, yesterday, devising
ways and means for the lawful aid of those
who seek to liberate Cuba.
At the conclusion of the conference
Mayor Phelan said he was willing to co
operate by appointing a committee of
fifty prominent citizens, whose duty will
be to call meetings and raise funds to be
sent to the headquarters of the Cuban
League of the United States in New York.
"My attention was first called to this
movement by Colonel Ethan Allen of New
York," said Mayor Phelan, yesterday.
"He wrote and asked me to co-operate
with The Call and the Cuban sympathiz
ers here, and to appoint a committee of
fifty or more to take charge of the move
ment. While lam very busy with things
of more pressing importance here at home
I surely cannot refuse to appoint the com
mittee, as requested, and I shall select the
names as soon as I familiarize myself with
those most prominent as leaders of the
movement here."
The officers of the local society feel
grateful to the Mayor for his co-operation
and they are anxious to have all sympa
thizers send their names to the head
quarters, 2006 Mason street, as soon as
possible.
"The Mayor's kind willingness to aid
us," said President Jones yesterday, "will
result in the immediate organization of a
Cuban League here, and we shall operate
along the same lines indicated by the New
York society, Jed by Charles A. Dana and
Roswell P. Flower." >
The prospectus, which will be circulated
by the Mayor's committee, contains the
following announcement of the purposes
of the Cuban League of the United States:
This league, composed only of American
citizens, was organized at a large and enthusi
astic meeting, held in the Fifth-avenue Hotel,
New York City, December 14, 1896.
The purpose of the league was expressed in
the following resolution :
Eesolvcd,' That this organization bo called the
"Cuban League of the United states, " and that its
purpose shall be to give practical consolidation to
the sentiment of American citizens and the mora!
support of the same in securing to Cuba, by all
legal means, the inalienable rliht of -self-govern
ment.
The officers then elected were as follows:
President, Ethan Allen; vice-presidents,
Charles A. Dana, Thomas L. James, John R.
Dos Passos, Thomas F. Gilroy, J. Edward Sim
mons, Roswell P. Flower, Chauncey M. D_
pew, Theodore Roosevelt, George Hoadley, C.
H. Denison; executive committee, Paul Dana,
General Dan Butterfield, Ervin Wardman,
Frank B. Carpenter, Fred D. Grant, John D.
Keiley, John Jacob Astor, John C. McGuire,
R. C. Alexander, Constant A. Andrews, Walter
S. Logan, Thomas E. Stuart; treasurer, Charles
H. Denison, Potter building. 38 Park row;
New York City; secretary, Francis Wayland
Glen, room 404, 132 Nassau street, New York
City.
It is the purpose of Messrs. Jones and
Mascherini to get the names of all sympa
thizers on the roll as soon as they can pos
sibly do so, after which meetings will be
called and other means devised for the
aid of the cause of Cuba.
The following paragraphs from the ap
peal show the substantial way in which it
is proposed to convey benefits to the suf
ferers :
While we willingly give our sympathy in
words we should remember that there aie
times when an empty hand j carries no favor.
Such a time is the present, when the Cubans
stand in need of every necessary for life and
exhaustive battles. They must, of course, be
drained of resources, which our people should
supply. Arms and ammunition, and, more
than these, food for hungry troops and people,
with medicines for tneir sick and wounded,
may be shipped to insurgent ports with full
permission of our statutes since, with no for
mal blockade against us, we may as freely
traffic there as with the ports of continental
! Spain. To furnish these things, which may
legally be done, money becomes literally tha
sinews of war. The league asks for subscrip
tions throughout the United States in aid of
the patriots, which may be sent to Charles H.
Denison, the treasurer, Potter building, Park
row, New York City.
The Cuban League of the United States is or
ganized to give practical consolidation to the
sentiment of American citizens, and the moral
support of the same ln securing to Cuba, by
all legal means, the inalienable right of self
. government. It is proposed to so arouse pub-
I lie sympathy by mast-meetings and through
the press that recognition as an independent
State shall be secured to the patriots. .
It is desired that branch organizations be
formed throughout the country, and that
meetings be held in the other prominent cities
ol the Nation. Friends who may read this ad
dress will assist it' they organize at once and
report progress to the secretary, Francis Way
land Glen, room 404, 132 Nassau â  street, New
York City. We earnestly request the co-opera
tion of all men and women in this cause. In
grateful recollection of those who crossed the
ocean to help our fathers a century ago, let us
do now what is necessary to encourage those
who are repeating the story of Washiagton
and his compatriots. From the North and
from the South, the East and the West, let one
united voice proclaim independence for the
patriots, and young Cuba; powerful because of
this, shall scourge the assailant from her soil
and take her place with us in the family of
republics. ".',.'â¢2
SENATE DOORS
TO BE CLOSED
Lively Debate Occasioned
by the Arbitration
Treaty.
Hill and Stewart Argue That
Its Discussion Should Be
Public. '
Sherman, in Opposition, Scores a
Victoryâ Bill Pass d Over the
President's Veto.
WASHINGTON. D. CL. Feb. 8.-In the
Senate to-day Daniel from the Judiciary
Committee reported buck the House bill
to constitute a new division of the eastern
judicial district of Texas, with court to bo
held nt Beaumont, with a recommenda
tion that it be passed, the objections of
.the President to the contrary notwith
standing. .
These objections are that, according to
the statements of Judges and lawyers, the
change is unnecessary and would inter
rupt judicial business. .
Mills (D.) of Texas argued in support of
the bill and criticized the President for
consulting alone the Jud_e, the District
Attorney, the Marshal and the clerk of
the United States Court instead of con
sulting the two Senators and tbirteeu
Representatives of the State of Texas.
The bill was passed by the requisite
two-thirds majority â ayes 57, noes 1 â
Caff (D.) of Louisiana.
A bi.l to remove doubts as to the power
of the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia to provide for filling a vacancy
in the office of District Attorney was re
ported from the Judiciary Committee and
passed.
A concurrent resolution requiring the
President to return to th 9 Senate a bill
now in his hands in relation to the tim- !
ber culture land laws was introduced by I
Pettigrew (SD.) of , South Dakota, with
the explanation that a serious error bad
been discovered in the bill which would
frustrate its purpose.
The power of withdrawing a bill which
has been sent to the President under the
constitution was questioned by Hil (D.)
of New York, except it was to* correct an
error in engrossment, and after a brief
discussion the matter was passed over for
the present without action. By the de
cisive vote of 49 to 9 tbe Senvte this after
noon after a discussion of almost two
hours voted not to consider the reneral
treaty of arbitration between the United
Stales and Great Britain with open arms.
Secrecy will be maintained and tbe tra
ditions of the Senate will be perpetuated. j
The Senators who voted to open the doors j
were: Hill of New York, Brown of Utah,
Lindsay of Kentucky, Peffer of Kansas,
Roach of North Dakota, Stewart of Ne
vada, Tillman of South Carolina, Teller of i
Colorado and Pettigrew of South Dakota. :
The discussion of the day, which con
tinued close to 6 o'clock, showed that* j
the chances of the ratification of the I
treaty aro better than many of its friends !
supposed. The opposition, singularly
enough, appears to be confined to the sil
ver men Who supported the ticket headed
by Mr. Bryan. It is believed by the more
sanguine advocates of the convention that
a conclusion may be reached before the '
end of this week, but this is disputed by
many, who say the debate will be some
what protracted.
The proposition for an open session was i
supported in speeches by Senators Hill I
and Siewart and antagonized by Senators |
Mills, Hoar, Sherman, Lodge, Gray, Mor
gan and Daniel.
Hill at once made a motion that the !
doors be opened and t at the debate pro- |
ceed in the presence of the public. He j
laid some stress upon the ridiculousness 1
of the debate upon a matter the text of j
which was in possession of the public â !
not only the text, but the amendments |
proposed by the committee, which were j
published in full, despite tne refusal of j
the Senate to remove the Injunction of >
secrecy therefrom.
Tbe motion was antagonized not only
on parliamentary ground-*, but for the
reason that it would be against public pol
icy for such proceedings to be permitted.
Gray (D.) of Delaware was the first
speaker to antagonize the motion. He
was followed by Lodge and Sherman, who
likewise opposed the motion of Senator
Hill.
Both these members of the Foreign Re
lations Committee took the broad ground
that such a proceeding was against the es
tablished precedents of the Senate, and if
it was agreed to could only lead to ill re
sults. Treaties were solemn compacts
with other countries and whatever was I
said in the consideration of their merits I
or demerits ought to be said behind j
closed doors. If there was to be criticism
it ought not to be in public places where
the heat of debate might lead to theutte r
anee of sentiments that might be preju
dicial to the friendliness now existing be
tween the two nations.
â¢ In the course of his remarks Lodge said
that open doors meant endless debate, and
what he wanted was action. He did not
wish to see this treaty debated to death.
As amended and reported to the Senate
he favored it, and desired that such course
might be pursued as would lead to its rati
fication.
Morgan, another member of the com
mittee, also antagonized the motion of
Hill.
Senator Stewart of Nevada made /very
vigorous speech In favor of an open ses
sion. While he did not say so in words,
the inference was drawn from his remarks
that he desired such a session for the rea
son that it would be conducive to the de
feat of the treaty.
Following Stewart's speech Sherman
made another appeal for a secret session,
urging that there were special reasons why
this treaty should be considered in se
cret. He then read a letter from Secre
tary Olney asking that the Senate, in view
of Its rejection of King Oscar, do not fur
ther humiliate that monarch by permit
ting the criticisms that might be made to j
be made in public The letter was short
but earnest, although couched in diplo- I
matic language.
The vote was then taken with the result â¢
before indicated.
When the treaty was taken up on its
merits Sherman, as chairman of the com
mittee, made a short but effective speech.
He denied the* statements that any of the
interests of the United States had been
placed in jeopardy. The treaty had been
carefully considered by the committee and
had been amended as it was believed best
it should be. These amendments, while
few in number, were essential and oper
ated as a safeguard. Tne Nica
ragua convention, by an amendment
which declared that all questions affect
ing the national policy of either Govern
ment or of each Government towards any
other Government, should not be subject
to arbitration. Tbe Monroe doctrine was
not included and the United States never
would, be asserted, agree to the arbitra
tion of that doctrine. Arbitration was, he
said, the policy of the American people.
They had always advocated it. Sherman
here submitted an elaborate statement,
showing that we had entered into thirty
nine treaties, in which arbitration was
the cardinal principle. He spoke with his
old-time vigor and made a speech that im
pressed the Senate most favorably."*
Nelson of Minnesota briefly advocated
CONGRESS FAVORS TICKET-SCALPERS.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. B.â The Senate Committee on Interstate Com
merce took the anti-scalping bill up this morning apd a ter an informal discus
sion agreed that it would be impossible to pass the bill at this session and that
any report that might be made would be useless. The House has refused to give
the bill a day for consideration. It is understood that the debate in committee
for a short time was quite animated.
Mr. Chandler declared that the railroads of the country have openly and on
ever}' occasion possible violated the provisions of the interstate commerce law by
the formation of trusts, and lor one he did not propose to give them the opportu
nity to suppress the ticket brokers and prevent the public from securing the ad
vantages of cut rates whenever they could get them.
Gorman and Chilton called attention to the alleged conduct ofthe railroads in
the recent election, and asserted that they had ben guilty of coercion and other
practices intended to intimidate their employes. Both these Senators intimated
that the time was most Inopportune for the railroads to come to Congress and ask
favors.
The opposition was so manifest and vigorous that the committee was com
pelled to take the action it did, although there were several Senators favorable to
reporting the proposed measure.
the treaty and paid a high tribute to the
character of the King of Sweden, who hud
been agreed upon by Mr. Olney as umpire.
He denied that his sympathies were with
the English and intimated that at the
proper time he would move to reinsert the
article making him the unit. re.
Morgan's opposition to the treaty as a
whole was based upon the ground that the
convention went too far, inasmuch as it
sought to force the Senate to vieid up its
constitutional function as a part of the
treaty-making power.
This treaty provided a general court and
left It with the President to determine
what matter should be taken before it.
This was a power that was ac egated to
the Senate, and Morgan declared that it
could not give up that power. He would
not say that he was opposed to arbitration
as a principle, but he insisted thai each
case be met as it came up and that the
Senate should have a voice in arranging
tie details and determining upon the
tri unal.
Vest injected a remark to the effect that
the treaty virtually abo'isiied the power
lodged in the Senate and it was a danger
ous precedent to establish.
Turpie sail that the United States had
invited this treaty and it would not do
I to now withdraw.
To this Mr. Sherman readily assented
Daniel of Virginia opposed the treaty
briefly as an unnecessary convention that
would only tend to draw us into entang
ling iances.
Several amendments will be offered
during the course of the debate. Stewart
offered one this afternoon eliminating by
name the Alaskan boundary from the
operations of the treaty. He went so far
as to insert in his amendment a statement
of the United States claim with respect to
this boundary defining its location as de
termined by United States surveyors.
Other amendments that have been
spoken of will eliminate the Nicaraguan
canal by name and provide that nothing
in the treaty shall affect State issues
of bonds or interfere with the rights of
the States when incidents similar to the
killing of the Italians in New. Orleans un
fortunately happen.
It is the purpose of the committee to
keep the treaty before the Senate as
steadily as possible, and it will only give
way to pressing and urgent business.
Morgan will resume his speech to-mor
row where it was broken off by the motion
to adjourn.
Uneventful Session of the House.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 8. â To
day's session of the House was taken up
almost wholly in the consideration of
business relating to the District oi Colum
bia. None of it was of more than local
importance.
A copy of the returns of the tea of the
several States for Presidential electors,
which the law directs shall be sent to the
Speaker, was laid before the House and
wiil remain on the table until the official
canvass of the vote is made on Wednesday.

CIVIL SERVICE REPORT.
Constant Increase in the Number of Gov
ernment Employes Is Shown by
the Commission.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 8.-The
annual report of the Civil Service Com
mission to the President shows that at
the beginning of President Cleveland's
administration there were about 43,000
places included in the classified service.
The total approximate numberof positions
in the civil branch of the Government is
now 178,117, of which 87,107 are in the
classified service and 91,610 in the unclassi
fied service.
Of those in the classified service 84,239
are arranged in classes by compensation
and subject to examination and registra
tion, 26 are appointed by the President
alone, 781 are excepted from examination
or registration and 2001 are Indians in the
Indian service.
Of those in the unclassified service 5570
are excluded from classification for reasons
deemed best for the service, 4315 are ap
pointed by the President and confirmed
by the Senate, 88 are persons employed
merely as laborers or workmen, and 72,371
are considered as classifiable, but not yet
classified.
Of those not yet classified 66,725 are
postmasters of the fourth class. The
classifiable but still unclassified group will
be transferred to the classified service by
the action of the rules as, for instance, in
the customs service when the number of
employes in a custom-house becomes as
many as five, and in the postoffice service
when a postoffice becomes a free delivery
office. ,'.A.-^. .
By the revision of tbe civil service rules
practically all of the excepted positions
were transferred to the competitive list
The commission believes that the greatest
benefit will result to the public service by
tbis action, which transferred to the com
petitive department many positions, in
cluding those of chiefs of division.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 8 To
correct erroneous impressions as to the
official records of the war of the rebellion
which have recently been published
in regard to a general distribution of this
valuable work to public libraries, the War
Department requests tbe publication of

THE EGiPUAM QUESTION.
French Minister of Foreign Affairs
Replies to a Deputy.
PARIS, France, Feb. B.â ln the Cham
ber of Deputies to-day M. Hanotaux,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, replying to a
question by M. de Lencle regarding the
effect of the Franco-Russian memoran
dum, said that nothing has been done to
change the international situation in
Egypt as founded with the accord of the
powers. France, he said, held by the in
ternational acts, which it was impossible
for any Dower to invalidate.
M. Hanotaux, continuing, said be did
not d sire to engage in any polemics be
tween parliament and parliament (French
and English) which might cause regret
able misunderstandings. The dec ara
tions made by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach,
the British Chancellor of the Exchequer,
in the English House of Commons, he
said, wouid not tend toward a solution oi
international questions.' England had ac
cepted the position ot defending her case
before the mixed tribunal, ami why
should Sir Michael Hicks- Beach discredit
that tribunal, which had the approbation
of Europe? Would England nave pro
tested, ne asked, if the verdict of the tri
bunal bad been favorable to her? The
incident was then closed.

Lincoln. Nebr., Feb. 8. 1897.
Hon. George F. Washburn. Boston, Mass.â My
Deab_ir: After asking me for a comment on
your plan 1 see that you have answered that
comment in ihe public press. Ido not care to
multiply words, but simply desire to correct
one or two statements.
If, as you sny, you "do not favor the aban
donment of sliver," then there is no difference
between us. I am more in favor of pushing
the fight on ail the planks of our platform
than you are. lam just as much opposed to
the disintegration or absorption of the Peo
ple's party; but when you talk of "changing
the filming issue" then I am not with yon.
You go on to enumerate very many terrible
'.hings which my plan would bring about.
Why, my dear sir, my plan is to simply stand
where we have stood for ihe last four years;
my plan Is to simply push this fight on the
Fame lines that we have In the past on to
victory. My plan is not to desert free silver In
lis hour of deieat but to stand by it like men
until we reverse this v.rdict brought about by
misrepresentation and fraud.
The goldbug Boston Herald, for which you
gathered your symposium of letters, an
nounces in evident glee tbat your pan meaus
'â¢a practical abandonment by the Populists of
free silver." Ido not wish to adopt a course
that even has such a semblance of abandoning
free silver that it will give that impression to
our enemies.
Mv plan is to go on with the fight so that
we can win a victory in 1900, and thus bring
partial relief to tbe struggling masses of the
country. 1 do not have any fear that the
Republicans will bring about an International
agieement, and thus leave tne silver forces
etrauded as you speak about; and I do not
propose to cease the fight in anticipation of
thai result. If your plan is as 1 understand it
it is just such a plan as the money power of
this country would like to see the People's
party adopt. - " * - -â¢"â¢
You say there will be an informal confer
ence at Memphis on February -__. Is this in
pursuance of the call made by Paul Vander
vooriY You must realize that this is a mani
fest injustice to the Populists of the trans-Mis
souri country, for it is almost impossible for
them to reach Memphis at that time, and I
bee to remind you that west of the Missouri
River our party has seventeen of Its twenty
four Congressmen-elect, seven of its eight
Senators and five Governors, and that it has
Bute, county and municipal officers in almoat
every State ln this whole territory. This is
where the People's party was bora in 1890
and where it flourishes to-day in its greatest
vigor.
You charge me with calling a second con
ference. "I did not. I do not assume the
power ot calling conferences as some others
seem to have done. Inasmuch as there was
talk of holding a conference at Memphis 1
sugcested to Chairman Sutler that it be held
at Kaisas City, so that lt could be attended by
the Populists of the West as well as those of
the South. I have no doubt that the confer
ence at Memphis will adopt almost any reso
lution that the middle-of-the-road pany may
surges.. It will be entirely dominated by this
element. All those co-called I'opaiis s who
did what they could to deieat Bryan last fall
1 have no doubt will be represented at Mem
phis. The Republican spies in our camp and
the Populists of the Var.dervoort, Dunning
and Matthews stripe will doubtless all be on
hand If you care to lather a conference dom
inated by these elements you are at perfect
liberty to do so, but the Popuikis of the great
Northwest, who stand true to silver and all
our principles, will not be there and will not
be bound by any action which this "informal
conference may take.
You say that you have received many letters
from all over the country indorsing your plan,
and that mine is the only one which nas not
indorsed lt I was Informed by Mr. Deaver, one
of your National Committeemen from this
State, that he had sent yon a letter opposing
your plan, which you had not published. I
am in receipt of a very large number of letters
from Populist leaders who do not Indorse your
plan, and I tnink within the next two weeks
that I will be able to make public hundreds in
the same line.
Your plan seems to me to foreshadow a
practical shelving of tno silver issue by the
People's party. This 1 shall oppose, even If I
am the only Populist in the United States that
does oppose it; but I believe that a great
majority of the party will take the same stand.
Yours truly, .-â _â ,- _. A. Edgebton.
COCKRAN NOT A CANDIDATE.
The Eloquent Bourke Calls on Mr. Hanna,
and Afterward Says It Is Not
on Business. *
CLEVELAND. Ohio, Feb. B.â Bourke
Cockran came to call on M. A. Hanna to
day and returned to New York this even
ing. He was closeted with Mr. Hanna for
about two hours.
"This visit," said Cockran, "has no po
litical significance. It is just a social call
which 1 desired to make before going
abroad."
"It has been suggested that you were a
candidate for the embassadorship to Eng
land."
"You may say that I am not a candi
date for any place under the next admin
istration; that I will not accept a place if
it is offered, and do not expect that any
place will be tendered."
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. B.â A special from
Canton says: President-elect McKinley
has Interfered in the Senatorial fight in
this State by sending a letter to Governor
Bushnell requesting that Chairman Hanna
be appointed to succeed Sherman. The
letter was borne to Columbus by Judge
Day, the President-elect's trusted messen
ger, and this was tbe reason of his sudden
appearance in Columbus a few days ago.
The letter followed the request of th â¢
Governor and a note from Senator Sher
man intimating his resignation. It did
not demand Mr. Hanna's appointment,
but it suggested it in the interest of party
harmony and for the sake of Mr. Hanna's
services to the party during the campaign
it would be the right thing to do.
OFFICE-SEEKERS AT CAISTOy.
Spear Says Speaker Coomb* Wants the
Japanese .1 is mi on.
CANTON, Ohio, Feb. B.â Major McKin
ley had over a hundred callers to-day, and
it begins to look as it he would have to
take measures to limit them. He is feel
ing the demand upon his time, and if he
does not draw the line, soon his healti.
and strength will be pretty sure to suffer.
Among. the callers this evening was
Joseph S. Spear of California, who was an
active and influential factor in the ante
convention campaign and who bad a good
deal to do with Republican success on the
Pacific Slope. Mr. Spear said: "The people
of California and of the whole Pacific
Slope are greatly gratified to know that
they are to be represented in Major Mc-
Kinley's Cabinet and by so good a man
as Judge MeKenna. It was- not possible
for the President-elect to make a mistake
with three such men as Judge MeKenna,
1 De Haven and Waymire to choose from."
"Will the Republicans continue to make
gains on the Pacific Slope and hold what
tbey have now?" was asked.
"lam sure they will," was the reply.
"Fusion is disappearing there as else
where and will never be as strong again
as it was in November last." : ;v* _
"What recognition in the way of im
portant Federal appointments will Cali
fornia expect?"
"California has already received more
liberal and distinguished recognition than
was ever given her before. Judge Me-
Kenna is our first Cabinet olficer. I have
not benrd of many applications for im
portant places. Frank Coombs, Speaker
of tbe California House, is a candidate for
the Japanese mission, and I have been
told M. H. de Y'oun _ of San Francisco
wants to be Embassador to B rlin, but I
do not Know that this is so."
S. A. Perkins, assistant secretary of the
Republican National Committee, left lor
Washington this afternoon.
Among the callers to-day were Adelbert
H. Steele of New York, formerly Deputy
Commissioner of Public Works. Mr.
Steele said he came to talk over the New
York situation with Major McKinley and
not in the interest of any particular can
didate. He said that unless the party
could unite on some one very soon he
would venture to say that the Empire
State would not be represented in the
Cabinet. Mr. Steele had some warm
words of praise for Chairman Hanna and
declared that the business men of the
country want him in the Senate.
â¢JOHN D. J. OMI ACCEPTS.
The Governor Read if to Enter the
' inlet/ Cabinet.
CANTON, Ohio. Feb. B.â Ferdinand W.
Peck and Franklin Head of Chicago spent
an hour at Major McKinley's this even
ing talking over the aims of the National
Business Men's League. The league ad
vocates strongly the organization of a
new governmental department, tbat of
commerce and industry, and the move
ment has the cordial approval of the
President-elect, who also believes that a
permanent tariff bureau should be at
tached to the new department to deal with
the question of tariff reform, and so ulti
mately take the question out of politics.
The formal acceptance of Governor
John D. Long for the portfolio of the
navy was received here to-night. It has
been known for two weeks that he was to
be in the Cabinet, but the exact place he
was to receive was in doubt and was not
finally settled until the end of last week,
when a letter to that effect was sent him.
JONES- BUS HA COMPACT.
.* Deal That Spoil. Hanna's Chances
for the Senate.
COLUMBUB, Ohio, Feb. B.â A special
from Youngstown 10-day gives an inter
view with S. W. Anderson, law partner of
Lieutenant-Governor Jones, in which he
states tbat he was present at a conference
between Senator-elect Foraker and Gen
eral Jones at Z inesville two years ago, at
which it was agreed by General Jones tbat
he would withdraw Irom the race for the
Republican nomination for Governor in
iavor of Bushnell in consideration of the
support o* the party for lhe senatorship
when Senator Sherman should retire.
This corroborates the report which has
been given general credence that General
Jones is to be appointed by Governor
Bushnell to the vacancy in the Senate.

Sharply Questions Him as
to the Sugar Trust's
Affairs.
The Secretary Will Not Admit
That His Comoany Con
trols th- Market.
Formal Demand on the Cautious Wit

the Concern.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. B.â The joint
commission, appointed by the Le islature
to inquire into trusts and monopolies in
the State of New York, continued its in
vestigation this morning. Secretary
Searles of the American Sugar Refining
Company was on hand. His name was
called by the sergeant-at-arms and Mr.
Searles answered "Here."
"Before you take the stand, Mr. Searles,
I would like to have you explain why you
did not appear before the committee on
Friday and Saturday last when you were
subpenaed,"' said Senator Lexow.
"I was on the way to catch a train to
keep an out-of-town engagement when I
was served with the committee's subpena.
I asked Mr. Parsons to come before the
committee and explain the reasons for
my absence," said Mr. Searles.
Senator Lexow looked angry at this
statement. "It seems to the committee,"
he said, "that its subpena is superior to
any business. This committee makes no
distinction between the millionaire and
the beggar, and insists upon the same
obedience from both. The committee wili
not pass upon the question of contempt
until the end of your testimony, and see
it it be helpful to this committee." *
Mr. Searles was then sworn, and related
to the commiitee his various business
connections. He was sharply questioned
by Senator Lexow concerning the pur
chase of the North River Sugar Refinery
and the formation of the alleged sugar
trust, but the witness would make no ad
missions of the charges of stock watering,
etc., contained in the Senator's question.
Chairman Lexow said, significantly,
tbat the committee would have to get
the books of the companies that were
consolidated into the trust, no matter
who held them, when the witness said
thai the American Sugar Refinery Com
pany did not hold them.
Witness said tne total consumption of
refined sugar in the United S.ates was
1.500,000 tons annually and that his com
pany produced about 1,200,000 tons. The
American Refinery Company fixed the
price before they fixed it so low that they
undersold their competitors. Witness
would not admit that his company con
trolled the sugar market.
Chairman Lexow t en called the atten
tion of the witness to his testimony before
the Senate Committee at Washington,
when he said that the object of the con
solidation was to control the output of
sugar and shut off competition. *
"How do yon explain your testimony
before the Senate committee?"
"Oh, that must be read with the con
text."
"Is it not a fact that where you have
competitors you cut down the price in
their particular locality and force them to
the wall?"
"No, sir, it is not."
"But you control the price of sugar? '
"We only control the price of our own
sugar, and I disagree with any other
statement."
Chairman Lexow at this point grew
grave and said: "We now notify you for
mally to produce the minutes of the
American Sugar Refinery Company direc
tors' meetings and also all data and mem
oranda in relation to the purchase of the
four Philadelphia refineries in 1892. I
will ask you now whether you require a
subpena duces tecum or whether you will
pio tuce them without it?"
Mr. Searles paused a moment and then
said: "The books of the company are
not in my control and I have no right to
produce them. I will submit your request
to the directors."
"Are you personally willing to produce
them?"
"Personally I have no objection, but I
have no right to produce them."
Chairman Lexow then put a number of
questions to the witness regarding the
market prices of refined and raw sugars.
The witness said that three of the re
fineries absorbed in the consolidation
were abandoned because it was shown
that the same amount of sugar could be
manufactured more economically and the
work was iransf rred.
Chairman Lexow then informed Mr.
Searles that be had finished with him for
the present.
Chairman Lexow said the whole board
of directors would be summoned if neces
sary in order to determine just what
books were wanted.
An adjournment was taken until Satur
day morning at 9 o'clock.

Many Dark Stories Circulated in
Reference to the Inquiry of
.. the Finance Committee.
REPORT OF THE STATE SECRET
- SERVICE WITHHELD.
But It Is Said the Chief Executive Is
Laying Wire to Secure Con
victions for Perjury.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. B.âGov
ernor Budd has chosen to lock horns with
the Finance Committee of the Senate on
the matter of the investigation of the
coyote bounty claims, and as a conse- >
quence the old-time scandals relative to
this scandal-breeding subject are likely to
fade into utter insignificance.
lt had become known to the Finance
Committee through tiie columns of The
Call that the Governor was in posses
sion of considerable valuable and impor
tant information on thiÃ subject, and
Chairman Voorheis and Senator Wolfe of
that committee"called on the chief exec
utive of the State this afternoon in order
to have a conference with him on the mat
ter and secure his co-operation to bring
. all the testimony known to be in his pos
session before the committee.
Much to tne surprise of his visitors the
Governor declined to accede tc the sue
gestion of the Senators. His reason was
that the information which he had secured
in his investigation a few years ago was
obtained through the medium of tne State
secret service and that, in consequence, it
was privileged matter and not subject to
the scrutiny of any investigating commit
tee. He cited in support of his attitude a
decision of the State Supreme Court.
Senator Wolfe undertook to argue the
matter with tbe Governor, and toe dis
cussion soon assumed the violence of an
altercation. The voices of both the Gov
ernor and his pugnacious and insistent
adversary rose to a high pitch, but the
Governor refused to be moved from his
position. In the course of the contro
versy Senator Wolfe claimed that the
Legislature had a higher authority than
the Supreme Court, as the latter body was
only a creature of the law-making branch
of the Government,
The two Senators were finally compelled
to withdraw without having made any
headway with Governor Budd, though
when they departed amicable relations
had been re-established all around.
This obduracy of the Governor only
made his interviewers more determined
to thoroughly probe the coyote-scalp
claims till they succeeded in touching the
fountain-bead of the corruption that they
feel certain is connected with them.
The conference with the Governor took
place during the afternoon -eesion of ihe
Senate. At 4 o'clock the Finance Com
mittee met in executive session and unani
mously decided to ask the Senate to
morrow to adopt the following:
Resolved, That the Committee on Finance De
and they are hereby empowered to thoroughly
investigate the subject matter contained in
Senate bill 488, and ln furtherance thereof to
send for persons and papers and to administer
oaths.
Senate bill No. 488 is the coyote bounty
claims bill. In thi< bill full power is re
served to the State Board of Examiners to
examine all claims presented for coyote
scalps, and it is further provided that
"any person swearing falsely or giving
any false testimony before said board in
regard to any matters upon which he may
be examined under the provisions of this
act, shall be deemed guilty of perjury."
Significant in this connection is that
part of the report of the State Board of
Examiners which states that the number
of unpaid scalps for which certificates
have been issued is 57,523, aggregating
the sum of $287,615. The concluding
words of the report on this subject are as
follows: "The board respectfully recom
mends that an appropriation be made to
pay these claims."
In justice to the Governor it is but fair
to state that one of the reasons he ad
vanced for refusing to give the envoys of
the Senate Finance Committee the full in
formation which they desired was that he
was desirous of placing those who had, as
ssWh* believed, previously testified falsely in
a position where they could be convicted
â¢of perjury. If tbey had committed per
jury in the first instance they were now
exempt f_-om prosecution under the
statute of limitations, and he wanted
them to come before the Board of Exam
iners again.
The conduct of the Governor has cre
ated a deep feeling of indignation among
the members of tbe Finance Committee.
Many of them are of the opinion that his
action is influenced by a desire to shield
some of the county officials who were re
sponsible for the issuance of fraudulent
scalp certificates. One of the members of
the committee in an interview to-night,
gave his impressions as follows:
"To my mind there is no doubt that
great frauds nave been committed in con
nection with these coyote scalp claims,
and that there is a large and powerful
lobby now at work here endeavoring to
secure the passage of the bill. Those who
now hold these claims can well afford to
pay liberally forthe service of lobbyists,
as many of the claims were purchased
from the original holders for 25 and 50
cents on the dollar. I understand that
the Governor has taken issue with the
committee and claims that we have no
right to go into an investigation of the
kind we propose, and that such an in
vestigation is only within the province of
the Slate Board of Examiners. But we
â â¢hall fully test our powers in the matter.
Th* resolution which we shall ask tbe
Senate to adopt will give us the broadest
kind of authority, and among those who
will be subpenaed will be the Governor.
Then will come the crisis. Should he
decline to furnish the committee with
the information which he has admitted
jje possesses we shall be compelled to con
PACIFIC ROADS AS PUBLIC HIGHWAYS.
WASHINGTON, l). C, Feb. B âThe House Committee on Pacific Railroads to-day heard Stuyvesant Fish, president of
the Jersey Central Railroad, and F. S. Bond, vice-president of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul, on matters regarding the
Pacific railroads.
Fish suggests that the Government foreclose on the Union and Central Pacific at the same time and make them public
highways over which all connecting roads would have equal rights. The Sioux City and Pacific, a branch of the North
western, had been built in faith of the Pacific {railroad act that it would be a branch of the Union Pacific, but was cut off from
business with that company. He favored Government ownership on the ground that it would give all connecting roads equal
rights as was intended by the original act. If the Government, however, looked only to making the most money out of its
Pacific road interests it should accept the first good offer.
Bond could not say without consultation with other railroad officials what the roads running to the Missouri River
would like, but he was of the dpiniou that an organization of railroads could be perfected to purchase the Union Pacific.
J. T. Morrison of New York, representing bond and stock holders in the Union and Central Pacific railroads, advocated
a reorganization under which the stockholders would be taken care of.
The committee, after the hearing, went into executive session and agreed to report favorably the Harrison bill creating
a commission consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of the Interior and the Attorney-General, to provide
for the payment of the indebtedness of the Pacific roads.
clude that he is endeavoring to shield
some of the Democratic county officials
who have been implicated in the frauds.
You know there is such a thing as an in
vestigating body carrying its investiga
tions too far and finding it advisable to
drop them altogether. It is possible â
mind, I do not say it is soâ that the Gov
ernor may have probed too far into this
matter for the good of his party, and
therefore dees not care to make public the
result of his labors."
Ex-Bookkeeper McCalvy appeared before
the Senate Finance Committee this after
noon and asked that his connection with
the coyote claims bill be investigated.
Al Lindiey, history clerk of the Senate,
will probably be appointed to fill the place
made vacant by the resignation of Mc-
Calvy.

STATE PRINTEIi NOT TO EL AME.
Fault of the Commissions in Increasing
Expenses.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. B.â The in
vestigation into the affairs of the State
Printer's office did not progress this after
noon on account of the Republican caucus
which was held at the same hour as that
on which the commiitee on retrenchment
was to meet. State Printer Johnston was
on hand promptly at 4 o'clock to give his
testimony before the committee, but as
the committee did not return from the
caucus until half- past 5 o'clock he could
not wait.
After calling the committee to order
Chairman Melick announced that Gov
ernor Budd had refused to appear before
the committee. He said also that the
Governor would send a message to the
Assembly to-morrow in which he would
give bis reasons for vetoing the bill appro
priating $75,000 for the maintenance of the
State Priming Office.
A printer named Hicks, formerly of the
firm of Hicks, Judd & Co. of San Fran
cisco, appeared before the committee and
denied a statement made to the effect thai
he had complained to Governor Budd
about the management of the institution.
A desultory discussion followed, in
which Mei.ck remarked that the printing
office had been made a political dumping
ground for the friends of members of both
houses of the Legislature, but that this
had nothing to do with the increase in
the expenses of the institution. The nu
merous commissions which have been or
ganized during the past few years have
had a considerable quantity of priming
done â some of them to the extent of
$13,000 each in one year. The excess of
printing was thÂ« fault of the law and not J
of the State Printer The bills of the
State Mineralogist were very large, he I
added, that for printing in 1891 being I
$10,581. If the printing of each of those !
commissions could be restricted to $1000 j
each year a great saving could be effected. I
The printing of the reports, etc., of the '
State Agricultural Society ran Irom $10,000 I
to $13,000 in 1899, to $9000 in 1892 and to |
18000 in 1896. The chairman suggested j
that there should be a special act of the
Legislature restricting the quantity of j
printine done by the commissions. In j
the offices of some of those commhsions
thousands of copies of reports were piled
up, accumulating dirt and waiting for the
time when they will be converted into
fuel. He thought that if the quantity of
printing done by the commissions last
year were cut down one-half of it would
be sufficient. The men in the printing
office are competent and the bookkeeping
admirable.
Adams remarked that a large part of the
expense was caused by illy prepared
manuscripts and by the frequent revision
of proofs. It was stated during the dis
cussion that Labor Commissioner Fitz
gerald brought in a voluminous report
containing a large number of newspaper
clippings praising the commissioner and
his work. The State Printer warned to
cut down the report by omitting the news
paper clippings, wnicii were simply
editorial expressions of opinions. He
went before the State Board of Examiners
and asked permission to cut out that part
of the r-port before printing it, but they
laughed him out of ii. The matter of the
10,000 school grammars was mentioned.
The committee was of the opinion that
the State Printer was not to blame, be
cause the law required him always to keep
a siock of school textbooks on hand to
supply the demands. It was decided to
holu another meeting In a day or two and
have the State Printer suggest to the com
mittee some means of stopping the ava
lanche of printing from State officials and
commissions.

MUCH INTEREST
IN THE DREDGER
Public Works Commissioner
Leake Speaks of the
Big Appropriation.
The Monster Bates Dredger
Needed to Keep Navigable
State Streams Open.
With the Machine a Channel Twenty
F et Wide and Forty Deep Can
Be Cut Four Feet a Minute.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. B.â E. E.
Leake, Commissioner of Public Works, is
very much interested in the bill appro
priating $300,000 for the construction of a
monster dredger after the pattern of the
Bates machine. In his official capacity
he has made thorough study of the sub
ject and is convinced that the restraining
dams now to be provided to keep the
heavy detritus stored in the canyons from
coming down into the rivers and the
adoption of the modern dredging ma
chine will not only keep the rivers navi
gable â this being the primary object of
the bill but will also reclaim many thou
sands of acres of the most valuable land.
Mr. Leake said to a Call reporter this
morning:
"In the Butte, Sutter, Colusa, American
and Yolo basins there are 386,000 acre* of
swamp and overflowed lands that are in
undated by an average rainfall. Lands
partially reclaimed in the Sacramento Val
ley aggregate 115,633 acres, and are equally
subject to the dangers of ordinary floods.
In the San Joaquin Valley there are 336,240
acres of swamp and overflowed lands, of
which not more than one-tenth pari is
partially reclaimed.
"In 1861 there was returned in Sacra
mento Valley 502,000 acres of swamp land.
The area has since been- largely increased
by reason of the silling and filling up of
the rivers. The higher tnat levees are
constructed the more danger there Is to
land that naturally would not be subject
to overflow. Under the present unsys
tematic method of reclamation this area
is constantly increasing, while the value
of the land is constantly decreasing.
"On the assumption that this land can
be reclaimed it is a reasonable estimate to
place its value at from $30 to $50 an acre.
If this land was seeded to wheat and
would produce fifteen sacks to tbe acre, if
sold at 1 cent per pound the annual income
on the swamp land alone would be
$17,603,292. It would require a barge of a
capacity of 10,000 sacks 1258 days to move
this crop, taking 10,000 sacks each day.
At an average of $1 per ton the annual'
cost of transportation would be 5880,164 60.
"Engineer Hall estimated that on ac
count of high levee building ana other
conditions about 500.000 acres not included
in the above estimate are subject to per
iodical overflow. The perfection of a
drainage system would increase the in
come of the valleys $27,603,292.
"Reclamation distric s involving about
750,000 acres of land have been organized
in Butte, Colusa, Sutter, American and
Yolo basins. A computation made in
1894 showed that on the rivers and the
lands in these districts the Government
had expended $1,000,000 and the State and
individuals $17,000,000. and that for the
most of this there had been no adequate
return.
"The expenditures of 1895 and 1896 have
probably swelled the total to $10,000,000.
There is one reclamation district in Yolo
County on which the sum already ex
pended, and without satisfactory results,
is sufficient to construct a hydraulic
dredger and operate it for ten years.
"The new dredger and all the machin
ery connected with it can be constructed
in this State, lt is one of the most won
derful Inventions of the century. The
official test made by the Government re
cently showed that the maximum capac
ity of the machine was 7798 cubic yards
per hour, while the average ot ten" con
secutive tests is 4921 cubic yards per hour.
The average per cent of sand in the water
discharged was 23.02 (twenty-three and
two one-hundredths). Such a machine in
operation at the Newtown Shoals would
in from forty to fifty days completely ob
literate that obstruction. The effect of
this would give to the entire length of
that stream a relief never beiore received.
It would so increase tbe velocity of tbe
water by augmenting the flow of the tide
that the major portion of the shoals would
be cut out by the natural flow of the
stream."
Mr. Leake was asked as to the claim
made by another inventor that the Bates
dredger was an infringement on his
patent. In reply Mr. Leake said that tbe
State should be amply secured against
any possible litigation in the matter.
Assemblyman Cutter of Yuba said that
the beds of the Yuba and Feather riv rs
in many places were higher than the sur
rounding country, which was not swamp
land either. This fact necessitated the
raising of the levees correspondingly, but
in spite of all the care tbat could be taken
the seepage through the levees continued
to do great damage. Miners and farmers
were united on the restraining dam and
the dredger bill . he added, and there
would be no objection to their passage.
"Think of it," added Mr. Cutter. "A
machine that cuts a channel twenty feet
deep and forty .feet .wide at the rate of
four feet a minute will work wonders in
the way of increasing the navigability of
our rivers and keeping them navigable."
Each Court â  Wants a Clerk.
Sacramento, cal., Feb. Before
tbe Senate San Francisco delegation
Judged Groezinger and Carroll to-night
argued the need of a clerk for each of the
five San Francisco Justices of the Peace.
It was decided by the delegation that a
favorable report should be made on the
bill providing them, and fixing their re
spective salaries at $100 a month. Mayor
Phelan sent a communication to the dele
gation stating there was no need of such
clerks.
COUNTI GOVERNMENT ACT.
Compensation of Officers Appears a
Knotty Problem to Solve.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. B. âThat
bogie bill, the county government act, oc
cupied most of to-day's session of the
Senate as a special order. Each session
this measure takes up from two to ten
days in each bouse, to the exclusion of all
other business. This bill, as submitted by
the Senate Committee on County Govern
ments, comprises 150 pages, or about
60,000 words, and it will take, it is ex
pected, about a week in each house for
consideration.
The sections fixing the salaries of the
various county officers are the stumbling
blocks, as each member has more or less
changes to make at each session and he is
generally between two hot fires. On the
one side are the county officials with their
demands for increased compensation or
assistance, or both, and on the other aTe
the protestations of the other constituents
of the members against any such increase
and a consequent addition to the burden
or taxation.
ln order to obviate this biennial tangle,
wrangle and waste of time, Senator Smith
has introduced a constitutional amend
ment, providing as follows:
The compensation of such officers and of
their deputies, clerks and assistants, shall be
regulated in such manner as the Legislature
may, by uniform laws, provide.
Should this be adopted by the Legisla
ture and approved by the voters, it is
intended to introduce a bill in the next
Legislature providing that the question of
salaries for county officers shall be left to
the Supervisors of the respective counties.
It is argued that such salaries come out of
the county treasury, and that consequently
they should be regulated by the le nslative
bodies of the counties. The proposed con
stitutional amendment is generally
favored.
THE UM VtUSITJ.
Mahoney Tils put . the Statement That
It Was a Poor Man's School.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. BâAssem
blymen Valentine, Cutter, North, Dibble,
Malcolm, Dryden and others made
speeches this morning in favor of the
final passage of Wright's Assembly bill
120, to levy a tax of 1 cent on each $100 of
taxable property in this State for the pur
pose of creating a fund for additional
support, maintenance, etc., of the Uni
versity of California.
The work of the university was highly
praised, and the institution was spoken of
by several of the speakers as a poor man's
institution. Mahoney took exception to
this title. He was a poor man and the
son of a poor man, and he had always
felt a desire to go to the university, but
he had never been able to do so because
of the lack of funds to support him while
in the institution should be go there. The
best that ha had been able to do was to
work hard in order to be able to attend
night school.
Notwithstanding the fact that the uni
versity was practically closed to the chil
dren of the poor, because their parents are
unable to support them while they are at
tending that institution, he would vote in
favor of the bill, and hoped that it would
pass.
The bill was passed without objection,
and was sent to the Senate.
But the Office Will Cease.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Feb. 5.â A rather
humorous incident occurred at the meet
ing of the Senate Finance Committee in
connection with the bill providing for the
salary of the Commissioner of Public
Works. The bill, which originally pro
vided for a a salary of $4000 per annum,
was amended by the Assembly so as to
reduce the amount to $3000. It next
turned up before the Senate Committee
on Labor and Capital, which indorsed the
proposed reduction, but recommended
that it be not made to apply to the incum
bent. The members oi the committee
had evidently lost sight of the fact that
the office of Commissioner of Public
Works will cease to exist at the expiration
of the term of E. E. Leake, the incum
bent.
Fern of Iw t Attorneys.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Feb. B.â The
Committee on Claims of the Senate to-day
decided to recommend that the attorneys'
fees for Robert Y. Hayne, W. W. Foote
and J. C. Daly in the Railroad Commis
sion's case be reduced from $25,000 to
$12,500.
Judge Havne and W. W. Foote. un
aware of the action of the Claims Commit
tee, appeared beiore the Finance Commit
tee of the Senate to present their case for
the payment to them or the $25,000
awarded by the Board of Examiners. They
also argued in favor of the $30,000 contin
gent fund to be used in the continued
prosecution of the case above referred to.

Senator Sam Braunhart Denounced as
Not Being the Frienl of Labor
in Preparing the Bill.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. B.â There
was a joint meeting of the San Francisco
delegations of the Legislature to-night to
listen to the streetcar employes, who came
here to plead against the passage of the
Braunhart bill to reduce streetcar fares
between certain hours of the day.
It was evident again to-night that the
two delegations are not en rapport, the
Assemblymen showing signs of restless
ness under the tight reins of Senator
Mahoney, chairman of the Senate delega
tion. They claim they are given no op
portunity to participate in proceedings
before the joint delegation.
There were present the following delega
tions of streetcar employes from the
Market-street, Sutter-street, California
street and Sutro roads: W. C. Carpenter,
Frank Bell, G. A. Grimes, E. E. Hardy, J.
C. Sawtelle, L. W. Hallingsworth, J. T.
Miller, 1. J. Manning and William C.
Cook. Their first move was to present the
following petition:
We, the undersigned employes of the vari
ous street railroads in operation within the
limits of the City and County of San Francisco,
respectfully represent as follows: That fully
5000 men are at present in the employ of the
various street railroads within this City and
County; that the wages paid jto employes by
the controlling corporations are barely suffi
cient to supply tne necessaries of life under
present conditions, especially to those who
have families dependent upon them; that the
measure now under consideration by your
honorable body whereby it is proposed to re
duce rates of fare on streetcars is detrimental
to the Interest and welfare of every street rail
road employe, inasmuch as the passage of
such a measure would entail a corresponding
reduction in the scale of wages paid to em
ployes by the various companies; and firmly
believing that such would be the result we
therefore humbly petition your honorable
body to reject this and any such measure that
may be presented for your consideration.
W. C. Cook, a conductor on the Castro
street line of the Market-street Railway
Company, spoke against the passage of
the bill, claiming tbat its ultimate result
would be to reduce the wages of the
employes.
In ans tver to questions he stated he was
paid 22 cents. per hour and that the aver
age earnings of a car on his line per day
is about $16 for eleven hours. He also
denied that the appearance of the street
car employes before the committee was in
any way due to fear of or intimidation on
the part of their employers.
Mr. Carpenter, the president of the
streetcar employes of San Francisco,
stated tbat he was employed on the Fill
more-street line, and that the amount col
lected on some of tha cars of ihat line was
as low asl per day. In another case, he
said, forty-five pessen_ers were carried on
one of these cars during the busy part of
the evening and forty-four tendered trans
fers, while the other was a policeman.
This, he admitted, however, was an un-
I usual case. He believed, that a reduction
of wa_es would follow, because the cor
poration would be only, too glad to have
an excuse, to reduce wanes. He added
that San Francisco was the only ciiy on
the Pacific Coast where streetcar men re
ceived more than 20 cents per hour. He
said that in the course of inquiries from
passengers on his car he had not heard a
sincle one express himself in favor of the
reduction.
F. Bell, a gripman on the California
street line, was of the opinion thai the
men would have to stand any reduction
to lares. Sixty-five per cent of the earn
ings of the company, he clamed, went for
wages to employes. He informed the
committee that the company had been
paying 6 per cent on its capitalization, but
did not know that it was doing as well
now. As the company with which he is
employed transferred to and from the
Union-street and Sutro lines, it carried
many passengers for 1% cents, having to
divide the 5 cents witn the two other
roads. Two-ihiras of its passengers are
carried between the hours presented in
the bill tor the 2^-cent fares. The reduc
tion, he said, mignt enable a few persons
to save $1 50 a month, but it would reduce
the wages of 5000 men $10 to $15 a montb.
"If you are trying to benefit labor," he
remarked to Senator Brannhart, "you are
on the wronc side. Labor organizations,
I am sure, when they know the circum
stances, will not favor the proposed reduc
tion infares."
I. J. Manning, a gripman on the Jack
son-street line, declared San Francisco
was acknowledged to have the best street
railways in the world. He knew of in
stances when but 15 cents were taken in
on a round trip. He was convinced that
if the men were to go out on a. strike the
companies could replace every one of
them at once for less wages.
Here a wrangle occurred between Sen
ator Braunnart and other Senators. They
claimed that tbe father of the bill under
discussion was unduly lengthening out
the hearing by asking unnecessary ques
tions. â¢ â ."..,-
E. E. Hardy, a conductor on the San
Francisco and San Mateo electric railway,
said if the bill were passed that company
would not be able to take a car out of
their carhous- . He stated tbat the re
ceipts of his car on one Sunday was only
$6 50, and that out of this his and the
motorman's wages, amounting to $4 50,
bad to be paid. He admitted this was on
a rainy day and that on fine days the re
ceipts on Sundays ranged between $11 and
$15. For five cents, he continued, a, pas
senger could travel on that road from the
county line to the ferry landing or the
Cliff House, or from the Ocean House to
the Union Iron Works. On weekdays al
most tbe entire receipts of the road came
in between, the hours between which it
was proposed to reduce fares.
Carpenter closed the case for the street
car employes, by a plea against the pas
sage of the bill.

Upon a rollcall '.it developed that there
was no quorum. A call of the House was

In the Senate this afternoon Assembly
bill 21, providing for the disincorporation

ond reading. Several other Assembly
bills were on the special file, but the re
port of the committee on revision of them
was withheld to force them over so that
the county government bill could be

The consideration of this bill consumed
the greater part of the afternoon, a num
ber of amendments being adopted; among
which was one by Stratton, compelling
assessors to file a verified account, with
vouchers attached, of all disbursements
incurred in the making of maps for as

Christian Endeavor convention to be bald
there in July, is at present in this city.
"We came near having the convention
two years ago," he said, "but could not
then make satisfactory railroad rates.
Now wo have fixed a round-trip rate that
is the lowest that has ever been given. The
convention of 1397 goes to San Francisco
at the invitation of the State Union of
California. ......
"In San Francisco, as in other cities,
many leading citizens were unacquainted
with the Endeavor movement, but when
it was explained to them they came for
ward with a ready response to raise
$25,000 to care properly for the convention.
"In the East I find among business men
a growing interest in the opportunity to
visit the Pacific Coast at a cost so nominal
as $50 from Chicago to San Francisco and
back, and one fare for the round trip to
Chicago. This fare is open to everybody."
Mr. Webster said the Endeavorers
should take warm clothing, as in the
month of July the mean temperature in
San Francisco is HO degress and there is
not a little fog. An hour's ride, however,
takes visitors into a warmer climate.
ARGENTINA'S ; INSURRECTION.
Religious Fanatics Rout Federal Troops
and Destroy More Than Sixty
Rich Plantations.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. B.â The Her
ald's special cable from Buenos Ayres
says: Rio Janeiro advices state, tnat the
fanatical insurrectionists under Consel
heiro have now 6000 well-armed men or
ganized and concentrated in Bahia.
The people in the rural towns are now
helping the fanatics witn arms and money.
Where this help is not given the venge
ance of Conselbeiro's band falls upon the
settlers. In this manner more than sixty
rich plantations have already been de
stroyed. The Government has been in
formed that several foreigners have j oined
the fanatics and are pushing forward a
more scientific military organization
among them.
Two small towns were pillaged and
burned by the fanatics yesterday. In sev
eral skirmishes with the federal tr. ops the
latter were defeated. The fanatics have
obtained steam launches and now patrol
the rivers and streams in the districts
where they are strongest. In this way the
range of devastation committed by them
is extended, and the utmost terror pre
vails in that region.
The press of Rio Janeiro now demands
that the Government immediately send a
much stronger force to Bahia to overcome
| the fanatical movement.
The Society of Spiritualists of Rio Ja
| neiro has sent a commission to Bahia to
attempt to convince the fanatics that it
will be well for them to submit to the
Government in temporal matters. It is
! again charged by the press of Brazil that
the enemies of the republic are the insti
| gators of the outbreak.

THEIR UNDOING
Four Tramps Poisoned by
Drinking Illuminating
Alcohol.
Two Are Dead, Another Missing
and a Fourth Writhes
in Agony.
The Survivor Claims They Bought
the Poisonous Liquid at a
Saloon.
TULARE, Cal., Feb. Four tramps
were poisoned here last night as a result
of drinking alcohol which they purchased
In Sumner. Two are dead, the third is in
_ precarious condition and the other can
hot be found, but is believed to have sue
sumbed also.
Night Watchman George Newell was
Informed by a tramp shortly alter 9
(.'clock that a man way dying in a boxcar
dear the corral. Newell went to the place
Â»nd found the man suffering intense pain.
He gave his name as Stewart Taylor of
Maryaville, Cal. He was brought to the
depot and medical assistance was sum
moned, but he died in great agony soon
afterward.
Another tramp, giving his name as
Burns, appeared this morning and told
the officers that he believed be had been
poisoned. He wav taken in charge and
made as comfortable as possible, and is
now at the Centra! Hotel, with some Pope
of recovery. From him it was learned the
cause of their distress, and he also gave
information which led to the finding of a
Becond dead man.
Burns says that the alcohol they drank
was purchased at a Sumner saloon. He
says they bought forty cents' worth, and
afterward returned ani bought twenty
five cents' worth more.
Burns told City Marshal Carlisle that
his partner was in a boxcar and that he
was suffering great pain. The officers
went at once to the old roundhouse
grounds and there found the man's body.
He had died shortly before their arrival.
The fourth tramp, who is a short, heavy
set fellow, about 35 years old, has not
been found. Burns says he took quite as
much of the alcohol as did the others and
it is supposed that his body will be found
in some out-of-the-way place.
A Coroner's jury passed upon the caÃes
of Taylor and the unknown dead, bringing
in a verdict of death by alcoholic poison
ing.
It is well known that pure grain alcohol
will not kill if imbibed moderately, but
that wood alcohol is deadly poison and is
used only for illuminating purposes.
Competent authorities state that an ounce
of wood alcohol will kill a man. The
bottle the tramps had holds twelve ounces,
enough to kill twelve men..
Burns, who now lies at the Centra]
Hotel, is perhaps 37 years old. He is
smooth shaven, wiih the exception of a
mustache of several weeks' growth, has a
dark complexion, dark hair and is 5 feet
7 inches in height. Taylor and the tramp
whose name cannot be learned will be i
buried here to-morrow. . I
SAN JOSE DIVORCE SUITS.
Action Against a Daughter of the Late
W. W. Wilsonâ Decree for Mrs.
Hambly.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. s.â Frank E.
Coykendall, a prominent young business
man of this city, to-day began a suit for
divorce from his wife, Alice Mac Coyken
dall, now living in , Chicago, on the
grounds of infidelity and desertion. The
plaintiff is the daughter of the late W. W.
Wilson, the inventor of the Wheeler &
Wilson sewing machine. The couple
were married in Chicago on November 22,
1892, and the wedding was an important
social affair. They then returned to San
Jose accompanied by her father. Shortly
after Mr. Wilson died suddenly, and Mrs.
Coykendall inherited considerable prop
erty.
On January 31, 1896, Mrs. Coykendall re
turned to Chicago, where she has since re
mained. The divorce case is no surprise,
as at the time of Mrs. Coykendall's de
parture her friends understood that she
would not return. There are no children
and no community property.
K'tty Hambly was granted a divorce
from Thomas W. Hambly to-day by Judge
Lorigan on the ground of failure to pro
vide. Hambly first began suit against his
wife on the ground of desertion, but this
was abandoned, and she instituted a
counter suit. Hambly is a letter-carrier.
Mrs. Hambly testified that her husband
belonged to so many lodges that the ex
pense was so great that he wa_. unable to
support her. The plaintiff was awarded
the custody of the child and $20 a month
alimony.
Suit for divorce was commenced to-day
by Flora A. Lacey against Leroy D. Lacey
on the ground of extreme cruelty.
SAN JOSE'S INNOVATION.
Secret Societies of the City Prepare to
Open Their Co-Operative
Drugstore.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. B.â The trouble
between the Sons of St. George and the
three Ancient Order of Fore, lodges
and the physicians and druggists of this
city has culminated in the organization of
â¢ stock company with a capital of $12,500
for the purpose of carrying on a drug
business. Articles of incorporation have
been drawn up and will be filed in a few
days. The stock is divided into 5000
shares of the value of $2 50 each, and will
be sold to the members of the four lodges.
It is said that nearly all the stock has been
subscribed. Case's drugstore on San
Fernando street, near the postoffice, will
be purchased by the company.
The difficulty between the societies and '
physicians is due to the refusal of the
doctors to take lodge business at a per
capita per member per month.
Ukiah Suspect Bound Over.
UKIAH, Cal., Feb. B.â The preliminary
examination of Gregorio Ybarra, charged

TA COMA'S SMALLPOX SCARE.
Third Case Develops Since the Arrival of
the Steamship Victoria From
Chine.
TACOMA, Wash, Feb. B.â The third
case of smallpox since Friday has broken
out here and grave fears of an epidemic
are entertained. The contagious disease
was brought from China by the Northern
Pacific steamer Victoria, which arrived
two weeks ago. Its Chinese crew was de
tained at Diamond Point, but for some
reason the quarantine officer allowed the
officers of the ship to coma to Tacoma,
land and circulate among the people.
On Saturday Second Engineer John
Cobb was attacked by smallpox and bis
residence on L street was quarantined.
The house is constantly watched by the
police to prevent people entering or de
parting and a special physician will be
chosen to-morrow to attend Cobb. An
other man, who lives at South Tacoma
and has been closely associated with Cobb
during the last few days, was yesterday
removed to the iatter's house and quaran
tined with him. With their families, eight
persons are now quarantined in the one
house.
So far the two men have had no medical
attendance, because the city and county
authorities are not agreed as to whicn
shall assume the responsibility and ex
pense of caring for the sick. To-morrow
this will be decided by an opinion of the
County Attorney. City Physician Quevli
is not anxious to attend the patients, and
the city officers prefer that he shall spend
his time vaccinating the school children.
Another complication arises from the
fact that new charter amendments that
have just gone into effect do not provide
for a Board of Health. The county pest
house was burned three years ago, but the
Commissionets are arranging to build
another at once in the belief tbat more
cases will develop.
This afternoon a little girl at Thirteenth
and A streets, in the center of town, was
found to have smallpox. She had been
going to school up to yesterday.
Federal quarantine officers are blamed
for allowing the Victoria's officers to come
ashore and visitors to board the vessel
while in port-
DROWNED NEAR SANTA ROSA.
Searchers Find the Body of Edward
Stump, Whose Riderless Horse Was
Cap .ured Recently.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. B.â The rider
less horse that swam from the Laguna de
Santa Rosa on Saturday proves to have
been owned by Edward Stump, a son of
Conrad Stump of this township. As soon
as the animal was identified the parents
of the young man were notified and a
large party began a systematic search for
the rider. For three days their efforts
were in vain, and it was not uniil late this
afternoon that the body was found in a
deep pool about twenty feet below the
bridge whicn Stump had attempted to
cross. __._â â¢-.
At the t'me of the accident the water
was running fully four feet above tbe floor
of the bridge, and it is supposed tbat the
swift current threw the horse against the
frail railing, which at once broke and both
steed and rider were swept into the seeth
ing flood below. The young man had
started to visit relatives at Cazadero,
twenty-five miles distant. He wore a
heavy overcoat and was otherwise dressed
lor a long journey and when thrown into
the swift current was unable to make
much effort to reach shore.
Stump was about 20 years of age.

STOCKTON, Cal.,. Feb. B.â William
Smith, aged 62 years, a member of the
gentry that live by their wits while they

its par value was $10. The sharper en
tered the general merchandise store of D.
M. Denehy & Co. and bought articles of
apparel to the value of $1 35, passing to
the storekeeper the "raised" dollar bill
and receiving the proper change in good
money. When the storekeeper discovered
that the piece of paper was not worth $10
he notified a constable and also tele
phoned to the Sheriti's office. Denehy

old man. the latter having gone toward
Gait. When he was overtaken and ar
rested he had in hi. possession a printed
treatise on "raising" money bills.

Tlieir Own Stores-
Boycotted.
*â 
Accuse the Wife of Its Owner
of Giving Aid to the
Police.
Officers Break Up a Private Court in
Which She Was Being
Tried.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Feb. B.â Chief of
Police Glass was notified yesterday that a
new source of trouble i.ad arisen in China
town between the Sam Yups an the See
Yaps. In addition to the former Doycott
of the See Yups aeainst the Sam Yups an
entirely new scheme of boycott has been
promulgated. This is no less a poser than
a boycott of the See Yups against one of
theirown stores; and the immediate cause
of this latest highbinder ukase is a
Christian Chinese woman, whose smile is
"child-like and bland."
The woman is Soo Hoop Sing, the wife
of Sing Chung. She is the mother of
nine chil J ren and claims to be a good
Christian. A short time ago two of her
children were presented with some caps
oy a prominent Sam Yup. This appeared
to enrage the See Yups, and the following
order, printed in Chinese characters, was
posted throughout Chinatown:
fie it known to all that the Soo Hoop Sing
woman conspired with the American people
to abuse our Chinese people wl.hout cause.
That cruel woman has not only done much
harm to our people, but has also assumed
leadership for the Sam Yup men against our
See Yup men by going to court to assist them
and help the policemen to 111-treat our people.
What have the white people to do with our
private affairs? All our people should stand
together and boycott Sing Chung's store. If,
on the other hand, any See Yup man should
be caught buying things from said store he
shall be dealt with as though he nought goods
from Sa n Yup stores. Let all bear in mind.
Posted by all people.
When Chief Glass heard of this notice
be ordered all copies of it to be torn down.
His orders were carried out, and soon a
delegation of Chinamen, accompanied by
an attorney, waited upon him. They mis
represented the notice, but the Chief had
had it translated and gave tbem to under
stand that there must be no trouble in
Chintown and no more posting of similar
orlers.
The heathens then resorted to a new
dodge. They proceeded to hold a private
court. Chief Glass beard of it and sent
Sergeant Smith and Detective Auble to
investigate. They found the court in ses
sion and the woman and her husband
present and under duress. The meeting
was broken up.
Soo Hoop Sing, Chief Glass says, is a
good Chinese woman, but she has never
assisted tbe police in any manner.
TROUBLES OF THE SEABORGS.
Suit Brought by the Aged Capitalist to
Recover Property From His Young
Ex- Wife.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. January
and May, in the persons of B. O. Seaborg
and his young 'ex-spouse, are to have an
other round in the courts. Seaborg is
now asking the court to assist him in re
covering a number of valuable horses and
some money that he gave to his wife,
Etta, J from whom he was divorced some
time ago. He claims that she obtained
some of his property through fraud; that
her profession of love for him was a fraud ;
that her life witb bim was a fraud; that
fraud permeated her wholo make-up. He
declares that the woman made him be
lieve she was affectionate and devoted,
and while ln that frame of mind he
conveyed to her the property that he now
wishes to recover. His attorney tried to
impress upon the Judge that the defendant
in tbe suit was a most undutiful wife and
was untrue to her vows while married.
Before the marriage she was aware that
Seaborg was weil off and thought that by
marrying him she could "pull tbe wool
over his eyes" and gain possession of con
siderable money and land.
In connection with tbis suit to recover
prop rty from bis former wife Seaborg bas
another pending in which Guy Barham is
defendant. Seaborg in tbis latter com
plaint asks for heavy damages, claiming
that Barbam is greatly to blame for the
trouble that has befallen the house of Sea
borg. ___________________

"KID" KEEPS THE BELT.
George Lavigne Gets the Decision From
McPartland in the Battle for the
Lightweight Championship.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. B.â George
("Kid") Lavigne of Saginaw, Mich., on
whose shoulders the mantle of light
weight champion fell recently, was called
on to defend his newly acquired title in a
twenty-five round bout with "Kid" Mc-
Partland of this city to-night. Lavigne
got the decision after the full twenty-five
rounds had been fought. The champion
did all the leading from start to finish
and punched his man hard, although it
was a very clean fight, without a trace of
blood. McPartland's awkward style made
it difficult for Lavigne to land his swing
ing blows on the jaw, but he kept the
local man strictly on the defensive.
McPartland's fast footwork and clever
ducking saved him several times. It was
a very fast battle, as Lavigne cut out a
terrific pace, which he maintained to the
close. McPartland put up a good staying
fight, but he scarcely led, except at the
opening of a few rounds before he was
forced to resort to saving tactics. The
bout drew a very fair crowd to the arena
of the Broadway Athletic Club to-night,
notwithstanding tbe prices of admission
had been raised to half again as much as
the ordinary figures.
MiPartland bad an advantage of nearly
six inches in height, and also had a
longer reach, but the Saginaw boy's
friends were in noway doubtful ofthe re
sult and very little McPartland money
was put up at odds of 1 to 2.
The preliminary bout brought out Jack
Daly of Wilmington and Jack Burke of
Brooklyn, who were scheduled to go
twelve rounds at 138 pounds, and fought
to a draw.
The principals of the main bout weighed
in at 3 o'clock, and McPartland barely got
inside' the limit of 133 pounds, while La
vigne scaled 131 }-Â£ pounds. The Saginaw
lad's seconds were Sara Fitzpatrick, Paddy
Purt- and Henry PidgeQn. McPartland's
aiders were Jack Dougherty, Billy Hamil
ton and Bob Clark.
The men shook hands at 10 o'clock. La
vigne started in with his customary vim
and quickly bad McPartland busy avoid
ing his rushes. The local man was very
awkward, but managed to duck some
dangerous blows. Lavigne, however,
laaded right and left on both sides of the
head and also put a corking right on the
body, while McPartland's left landed on
the Kid's chest just once. Lavigne kept
bis man continually on tie run. Mc-
Partland slipped to his bands and knees
twice in trying to get away. McPartland
delighted bis admirers in the third by put
ting a straight left on the mouth and
right and left twice on both sides of tbe
bead, while he managed to avoid La
vigne's rushes. The Saginaw Kid forced
Mac to the ropes several times in the
fonrth and kept the local man busy with
footwork. Lavigne sent a couple of hot
ones in on the body, and Mac countered
with the left.
There was lots of good fighting in the
next three rounds, and Lavigne opened
the seventh with two left swings on the
jaw and followed up witb a hard right on
tbe body. Then Lavigne landed on the
body, nearly doubling Mac up, and came
back with an uppercut on the chin. La
vigne rushed furiously and Mac dropped
on his knees. Just as the bell rang. Mac
landed a straight left on the chin that
staggered Lavigne. '. .-â¢?.-â¢
McPart:and shoved his left into
Lavigne's face when they came up for the
ninth, but a great right cross on tbe bead
evened up matters for the Saginaw boy.
After Mac put a left on the nose
in the tenth Lavigne forced him
twice to the ropes and nearly finished
him with a right on tbe jaw. McPartland
lo* ked twice with the close of the eleventh,
but though Lavigne was doing all the
work he appeared very fresh and Kept up
the fusillade in tbe twelfth. Mac rushed
in the thirteenth, but bis effort only made
tbe "Kid" smile. Lavigne kept up the
fierce attack and Mac waa forced to sprint.
Both put lefts on the mouth in the fif
teenth, and Lavigne wound up with a
fearful body blow and quickly bad Mac on
tbe defensive.
Plenty of money exchanged bands at
this point in the betting that Mac would
not last the twenty-five rounds. Mao bad
plenty of work to save himself in the
nineteenth, but managed to land a right
swing on the ear. Lavigne's tremendous
exertions began to tell a little bit on him
in the twenty. first.
In the twenty-second round Mac coun
tered sharply and crossed bis right once,
but Lavigne nearly floored him with a bard
swing just behind tbe jaw as tbe bell rang.
Mac took a lot of body punishment in
the next two rounds, but Lavigne could
not reach tbe jaw. Lavign* rushed like a
tiger in the last round, but Mac met him
with a couple of stiff, lefts. Lavigne was
desperate but a bit wild, and Mac de
fended himself well and stayed to the end.
The referee gave La7igne the decision.

Thomas Siddall's Method
of Attesting Love for
His Wife.
The Millbrae Man Admits in
Court That He Abused
Her at Times.
Physicians Decide That His Is Not a
Case of Insanity, but of "Pure
Cussedness "
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Feb. 8. â
Thomas A. Siddall of Millbrae, accused of
being insane and attempting to poison
his wife by administering morphine to
her, was this morning again brought be
fore the Superior Court on the insanity
charge.
It will be remembered that S'.ddall was
arrested last Friday night on a complaint
signed by Dr. Baldwin of San Mateo
charging him with being dangerous to be
at large. On Saturday he was brought
before the court on habeas corpus proceed
ings Instituted by his attorney, it being
then contended that he was illegally de
prived of his liberty for the reason that
he was not legally committed, the com
plaint not having been sworn to before
the committing magistrate. The Judge at
that time made an order releasing Siddall
on his own - recognizance, provided he
would again appear before the court on
the following Monday. The matter com
ing up again for hearing this morning the
writ of habeas corpus was granted. j"*.
This, however, availed nothing, for in
the interval between Saturday and to-day
another complaint was properly sworn to,
charging the same offense. The hearing
of this took place this morning. Drs.
Barrel of Redwood City and Miner of San
Mateo were the examining physicians.
Mr. and Mrs. German, who live oppo
site the Siddall home in Millbrae, testified
to many acts of cruelty on the part of
Siddall toward his wife. They had fre
quently been called in from their home at
all times of the night by the cries of Mrs.
Siddall. Tbey said that atone time Sid
dall took a lighted lamp into the barn,
which was filled with bay, and threw it
on the floor, smashing it to pieces. They
described certain eccentricities of Sid
el all's, such as going to work when the
moon arose and wonting all night, tear
ing apart and rebuilding his wagon, and
blowing a cornet while riding about on
horseback at different times of the day or
night.
Siddall denied these accounts. He
swore that his wife had a most impetuous
temper. He admitted that he had mal
treated her in times past, but denied tbat
he nad done so lately.
After hearing the evidence -on both
sides, the physicians suggested that there
were no symptoms of insanity, but that
the acts complained of showed rather a
spirit of mere "cussedness," and they
could not commit him on the evidence.
Tne court ordered him to be discharged
and intimated that the only way to reach
him would be by a criminal proceeding,
remarking that there was no jury in the
county but would convict him on the evi
dence produced before the physicians to
day.
But Siddall's troubles were not to end
with his discbarge. * Late this afternoon
his wife caused a complaint in divorce to
be served upon him. In the complaint
sue charges him with extreme cruelty,
alleging several instances when he mal
treated her, beating her with his fists
and knocking her down and fracturing
her arm. In the complaint she also ac
cuses him of having in the last week at
tempted to take tier life by administering
poison to her. She prays for a divorce
and a_ks the custody of their fiv -month
old boy; that Siddall be compelled to pro
vide for herself and boy and pay her coun
sel fees, and mat sbe be awarded the
whole of the community property.
Even this was not ; the end, for at the
time of the service of the divorce papers a
restraining order was served upon Siddall,
commanding him to refrain from incum
bering, transferring, disposing of or in
any way interfering with the personal
property. It further commanded him to

SUICIDE NEAR STOCKTON.
Rancher W. W. Hopkins' Body Found
Hanging From a Rafter in His
Woodshed.
STOCKTON. Cal., Feb. B.â W. R.Hop
kins, a prominent rancher living about
eight miles east of here, hanged himself
last night. The deed v.as discovered at
sunrise, when a boy employed on the
farm went after fuel to start the kitchen
fire.
As he approached the woodshed, near
the side of the house, he saw some object
hanging from a rafter, and upon closer in
spection discovered that it was the body
of the farmer.
A sawbuck near the body evidenced
tbe method employed by the suicide to
end his existence. He had taken a piece
of roue and tied one end to a rafter in the
shed.
Mounting the sawbuck he tied the other
end around his neck, and then stepped off.
His feet were within six or eight inches of
the sawbuck. He could not nave struggled
much, for he had not kicked it over.
"Dick" Hopkins, as he was called by
everybody, had trouble with his wife some
time ago and they were divorced. He
had been living at the farm with two of
his daughters and one of his sons since
then, and they were at home when he
took hi life.
The farm did not belong to him, but to
the children, having been left to them by
a relative at the death of the latter. He
managed it as tbe guardian of the chil
dren.
. Hopkins was a Grand Army man, and
was formerly a member of Rawlins
Post of this city. He was a New Yorker
and 47 years of age. He had been farming
in this county for many years, and during
the last few seasons had been hard pressed
for money. It is supposed that his suicide
was due to financial discouragement in
connection with his domestic troubles.
STEAMEKs TO SIBEBIA.
Tees May Fly Between Vancouver and
Vladivosiock.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. B.â Dr. de
Kannet, the eminent Russian lecturer,
who is now here to give addresses on Si
beria and its prospects, declares that with
the opening of the trans-Siberian railroad
there will speedily follow direct and rapid
steam communication between Viadivo
stock and Vancouver. This would place
British â  Columbia in an all-around-tbe
world route that could be traversed in
forty days.
Dr. de Kannet expects the Canadian
Pacific Railroad to join in the work of de
veloping this great route by land and by
sea. He predicts that, witn the opening
of the railway, there would come such
vast gold development in Siberia as would
make that country one of the greatest

Alford, who was killed on Friday night,
was not concluded to-day. It was shown
tnat the pistol had been held close to his

With great love for beauty which every
woman desires, she, with paints, powders

beauty, and that is health. Health pro-
duces a mind teeming with wit, the bright,
sparkling eye, tbe rosy cheek. With
health the whole world is a world of sun-

CARSON, Nev.. Feb. B.â Nevada's capi
tal is rejoicing to-night over a report that
: it has been selected as the site for the
Corbett-Fitzsimmons battle-ground. A
- story that has been circulated throughout
the city is to the effect that a person close
to Dan Stuart announced to-day that im
mediately upon the manager's arrival he
would make public his final decision in
favor of Carson.
About 100 people gathered at the depot
this morning expecting Dan Stuart to ar
rive. Tbey waited in vain. Stuart is still
a-coming, and there is no positive assur
* ance that he will be on hand for several
.days yet. He is taking bis time about it,
and while be may loom up as large as life
.to-morrow morning he may not be here
before Sunday. He is not a man who runs
!a brass band ahead ci him when he trav
els.
Carbett telegraphed to his agent, Cooke,
that he would train only at a spot of the
same altitude as that where be will fight.
Cooke was about town getting altitudes.
Despite the report that tbis city had been
fi?ed upon by Stuart, Cooke don't know
.â¢ yet whether he is measuring for Carson or
for Reno and i*Â« somewhat at sea. He
will be ready in a few days with a table of
â  altitudes that will fit either place. He re
turned from his trip to Bowers' Mansion
in Washoe County this morning and said
he did not believe it would do for a train
. ing-place; so if the fight is to take place
in Carson he don't know just what he will
â  do. Fitzsimmons has already hied upon
Carson Hot Springs. Cooke fights shy of
Steamboat Springs, as it is not sufficiently
' exclusive and is liable to be overrun with
visitors.
Joseph Grismer, the actor, writes to a
friend in Carson tbat he is glad to see a
â¢â¢â¢ law passed regulating the sport, and hopes
to be at the ria .side when time is called
on the champions. A number of theatri
cal people have telegraphed for dates for
the Carson Opera-bouse, and are intend
ing to bring tbeir companies into Nevada
about the time of the meeting.
Livingston to-day received an order
from Woodland, Cal., for twenty reserved
. .seats.
â¢ W. K. Wheeiock, Dan Stuart's agent,
while speaking of the attitude of the New
York press on the Nevada glove contest
â¢ law, said to-day: "The stand taken by
â  the people of sainted Gotham on prize
fights is worse than ridiculous. The place
recently alluded to in Congress as the
.Manhattan reservation is the greatest
. .cesspool of vice in America. If they
â  would pause in tbeir career of iniquity
and vice long enough to attend a few
genuine prizefights it would take their
' attention away from the teeming licen
* tiousness of their lives and renovate their
â  morals.
â¢ "Look at the Seeley dinner episode!
Nothing as scandalous could ever happen
in any of the Western States. A young
' society man gets married and he and his
friends celebrate the most sacred compact
in life by gazing at the disgusting pirou
etting of a woman on their dinner-table.
No wonder the police broke in. Did you
ever hear of a dinner being given in Ne
vada that the police had to interrupt? I
guess not. But, let me tell you, this was
. only a mild incident. At some of those
dinners given by the swells of Gotham,
who hold up their hands at prizefights,
there are scenes that no gentleman would
. describe in a Western barroom."
To-night Wheelock lef: for Reno osten
sibly to meet Dan Stuart, who is due to
_ arrive in Reno this evening.
CORBETT REACHES DENVER.
The Champion Tells What He Expects
to l>o to Mr. Fitz.immons.
. DENVER, Colo., Feb. B.â A large crowd
gathered at Union station this afternoon
to greet James J. Corbett, whose arrival
bad been well advertised. With consid
erable difficulty Corbett's party made its
'way through the crowd, and entering car
riages was driven to the Brown Palace
Hotel. After luncheon the champion,
accompanied by nis wife, was driven to
the residence of Bat Masterson, with
whom he discussed at some length the
preliminary arrangements for his light
with Fitzsimmons. To a reporter Corbett
talked freely.
"I suppose you want to know how I
feel," said he. "Well, I never felt better
my life and never more confident of
winning a fight. I shall always believe I
can whip Bob Fitzsimmons until Bob
Fitz.immons shows me I cannot. I have
. been training for the past six weeks, all
indoors, and what I need now is good out
door work. My trainer will insist upon
ray taking regular runs and walks every
day, and I will not be backward in obey
ine his instructions.
"Where will I train? Well, It has not
been fully decided, for we don't know yet
where the battle will take place. Of course,
I will train in Nevada and as near as DOS'
sible to the scene of the tight.
"I don't know any more about that
story of Bob tearing up the articles of
â¢agreement than you do. All I know
about it is what I have seen in the news
papers. 1 know that all my affairs and
ray end of tbe agreement were fixed up
and signed before I left New York, and I
. know Brady would not jet me go this far
if the articles were not in perfect shape.
All Fitzsimmons has got to do is to saw
wood and shut up. He can't get me into
any dispute this time that might end in
the fight being declared off. It is too late
in the day.
"I propose to fight him this time simply
to do away with the report that I am try
ije to dodge him, if for no other reason.
Whether I will win or he will is a question
which can be decided only by luture
events, but if confidence will help me to
win there is no doubt that 'Lanky Bob'
.will be groveling in the dust alter 17th of
March."
Corbett left late this afternoon for Salt

HALL SLAPS SLATIN.
To Pay for the Insult He Ie Floored
Hith Â«Â» Chair.
NEW YORK. N. V., Feb. EWorld
special from Quebec says: Slavin and
Hall are "deed broke. and in low spirits,
as they want to go to Carson and bave no
money to reach there. Local sports have
raised a fund of $500, provided they can
elude the authorities and fight for it. Tbe
winner is to get $300 and the loser $200.
On Sunday, when Slavin was eating his
dinner, Hall, wbo was drunk, and a
farmer who was in the same condition,
entered the dining-room. Hall and his
backwoods friend made merry at Slavin's
expense, and Hall slapped Slavin on the
face. Slavin immediately knocked Hall
down with a chair, and when the crowd
removed Hall and the farmer he resumed
his dinner.
Yesterday, when asked for their opin
ions on the coming fight, Hall said: "The
fight should be the best seen in years.
Corbett is the fastest and cleverest big
man of the century. Fitzsimmons is one
of the greatest fighters in his class who
ever lived; but in this case he is going
out of his class and will, I think, lose. I
believe the fight will last from twelve to
eighteen rounds."
Slavin, when asked about tbe fight,
said: "Fitzsimmons, in my mind, will
win the fight, no matter whether the fin
ish comes in the first round or the
twentieth."
STANFORD'S BASEBALL COACH.
Lange, the Chicago Center-Fielder, Arrives
to Take Charge of the Varsity
Nine.
. STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
B.â Coach W. A. Lange, tbe well-known
center-fielder of the Chicago nine, arrived
this afternoon. After coaching tne Stan
ford baseball team three weeks last year he
developed a winning nine. He will coach
the team about six weeks this year.
Lange spent the alteruoon looking over
the diamond add meeting the old and new
Daseball candidates. He anticipates a
very pleasant time while instructing his
men. During his stay he will stop at
Laurel Hall.
The big coach does not appear at all
worried by the fact that he must devslop
a pitcher to .take William McLaine's place.
He has seven men to choo-e from â
Thompson '97, Beckett '00, Lannigau '00,
Clemens '99, Plate '99, Lawton '00, and
Boyd '00. From these he hopes to get a
goo'i twirler.
Besides the pitcher be must find Varsity
j men for the positions left vacant by Har
j ris, 99, who played a strong game at sec
! ond base; Taylor '99. a clever shortstop,
j and Stansberry '93, who played left field.
j Claire Strohn 'GO, is the likeliest candidate
for second base, although be is also an
excellent catcher and first ba-e man.
I Longhead, '00, is a promising candidate
I for shortstop. Several other freshmen
I are in the field for different positions,
! some of whom give indication of consid
: erable baseball talent.
RIVERSIDE POLO CONTEST.
Southern Champions Preparing for the
Coming Tournament.
RIVERSIDE, Cal., Feb. B.â The River

tions for the entertainment of its guests
upon the occasion of the great polo toura

The Riversides are the acknowledged
champions of tbe sonth, having defeated

the Orph urn-
Louis James opened his season at the
Baldwin last night in "Spartacus," a
standard old-time play which be has re
vived for tragic and romantic purposes.
It requires considerable courage for an
end of the century actor to revive one of
those heavy declamatory dramas that
flourished in the days when people took
their theater-going more seriously than
they do in the year of grace 1897. when
Roman politics exercised a greater fas
cination for tbe general public than they
do in this era of McKinleyism.
James, however, has a strong personal
popularity to back him, and most of the
large audience went to pee the actor. A
few seasoned first-nighters who remem
bered McCuilough in the title role went
to see "Spartacus."
To the delight of the moderns Louis
James did not cant and rave. He entered
with force and passion into the woes and
wrath of the famous Thracian gladiator,
but be never tore his passion to tatters.
"Spartacus," even at this late date,
has some scenes which are calculated
to thrill the audience, the greatest of
all being the great arena scene, where
tbe Thracian captain reluctantly con
sents to fight one of his countrymen
on condition that he and his family
shall be freed. The man with whom
he is confronted is Pharsarius, his own ]
brother, and Spartacus is about to refuse
to butcher him "to make a Roman holi
day," when Pharsarius whispers that -the
gladiators are without, awaiting his signal
to revolt. Then comes the cry of free
dom, the rush of the gladiators and the
subjugation of the holiday-making Ro
mans.
This tragic scene was very realistically
acted by James, who looked a splendid
specimen of humanity in his gladiatorial
costume. Guy Lindsley, as his brother,
also did excellent worn. From beginning
to end of "Spartacus" tbe real burden of
the play rested on James* shoulders.
He bore it all through with spirit and
skill, till, having lost wife, child and
brother, the rebellious gladiator throws
himself and his little band of men on the
Roman army and is killed in the tent of
the pr_etor.
At the end of the arena scene James
waa called again and again before the
I curtain and was finally prevailed upon to
mage a speech, in which he expressed
great gratification at the warm reception
granted his effort at reviving a romantic
play.
Among the supporting company Dr.
William Sprague of this City was one of
the star's best henchmen. j He took the
part of one of tbe impresarios, so to speak,
who supplied the Roman arena with glad
iators, and he played the role excellently.
Of the feminine members of the cast
Miss Florence Everett acted nicely as
Sonona. and Miss Alma Kruger was fairly
effective as Julia.
Several of the scenes were fairly staged,
particularly the arena scene. If the
supers would take tbe trouble to act a
little the effectiveness would be much in
creased.
At ths Alcazar.
The Alcazar was crowded last night to wit
ness the first production of William Gillette's
merry little comedy "The Professor." The
company excelled itself in the clever work it
did. The people are well cast, and the per
formance ranks among tbe good ones given at
this house.
J. B. Folk as the "meek and mild" professor
causes peals of laughter. Mr. Powers again
proved his ability, and John Armstrong as
Old Brown succeeds ln making himself thor
oughly disliked, which, for a stage villain, is
no small success. Messrs. Foster, Belasco and
Clayton do effective work.
Miss Bertha Foltz as Daisy Brown, a child of
the woods, a part that thoroughly suits her,
does some clever work; and altogether the
production is an excelleut oue.
The Grand Opera.
"A Mile a Minute" is sensational enough for
any gallery, and it bids fair to have a good run
at the Grand, judging from its reception last
night.
All the favorites were in the cast, and they
did the best they could with the material of
fered. Julia Blanc's impersonation of Tiliie
Jacobs, a Jewish hag, showed her to be a
clever character actress. Miss Lorena Atwood,
Miss Lottie Williams and Edward J. Heron did
their work with great spirit.
There were several specialties introduced,
which added materially to the piece.
Columbia Theater.
For any one suffering from the blues "Chim
ipie Fadden" may be recommended as a sov
ereign cure. It is not one of those great
comedies for which managers and public scan
tbe horizon in vain; indeed it is a play with
scarcely any plot to speak of, but "Ctoimrate
Fadden" may be relied on to extract laughter
from the most hardened pessimist Last night
the audience, which filled all the boxes and
seats at the Columbia and camped on stools in
the aisles, greeted the play with an almost
constant flow of mirth.
To the casual reader of Townsend's novel
there does not seem to be much promising
material for the dramatist in Chimmie'* ad
ventures, but it is in the odd conglomeration
of character studies that the strength of the
play lies. The incidents which befall these
characters have been strung into some sort of
coherence, and dialogue which for the most
part is effective has been put into their
mouths; the actors do the rest, and most of
them are quite equal to the occasion when it
is a mirth-provoking one.
The burglary scene is a bit of melodrama
interpolated in the lighter fabric of the rest of
the play, but it serves its purpose in leading
up to the police investigation of the last act,
which ls the best bit of comedy in the whole
play.
Charles Hopper in his time, which is most of
the evening, plays many parts, although he is
always Chimmie Fadden. At one time Chim
mie is mirthful, at another pensive; now he is
arrogant to "cops," now tenderly sentimental
ln his relations with the Duchess, Miss Fan
nies French maid; ln fact. Hopper has to oe a
melodramatic hero, a tough, a sentimentalist
and a wag all rolled into one. Considering
the demands made upon him, he showed a
great deal of versatility. His Chimmie was a
sor' of expurgated edition of the Bowery
tough, thoroughly funny without being vul
gar. He sang several songs in a tenor voice
that was very pleasant to listen to, even 11 it
was a little throaty.
A little character study that delighted the
audience was Mrs. Marie Bates' rendering of
the bibulous Mrs. Murphy. If Mrs. Bates had
done nothing but walk across the stage her
make-up and her carriage would have made
an Instant bit. To see her was to recognize
immediately that sbe was the sort of Indi
vidual who would fiercely resent being called
anything but a "lady." -Dirty, draggled,
wretched looking to the last degree, she bore
herself with the proud consciousness of
superior dignity, and the richest bit of acting
In the play was the scene where the detective
ordered her to leave the room and Mrs. Mur
phy, more in pantomime than by word of
mouth, gave the detective to understand that
be was no gentleman.
Mrs. Fanny Den ham Rouse, as Mrs. Fadden,
was another actress who did clever character
work and aroused many laughs. The part ol

sorrows In bumpers of "extra dry," was played .
by George Nash. There were moments when
it almost seemed as if Nat C. Goodwin, grown
to larger and more florid proportions, were
playing Mr. Paul, so thoroughly did Nash imi
tate the Goodwin style, imitations are gen
erally objectionable, but Nash Imitates so
cleverly teat his Mr. Paul was one of the hits
of the play.
Most of the minor characters were well acted.
Miss Beth Franklyn was effective as the
Duchess, but she would have been more pleas
ing had she been more distinct in her utter
ance. Sydney Price was imposing as "His
â Whiskers. Barney Reynolds contributed to
the general hilarity as the bibulous butler.
"Chimmie Fadden" is not by any means a
great play, but it can be safely recommended
to those who want to laugh. - Â»

ally covered with flowers, was placed on the
rests and the sublime Episcopal service for the
dead was read. One floral piece was presented
by the Bible class ol the Sunday-school of
which the deceased was a member. The final
obsequies were performed at Dress Lawn
Cemetery. I
At tke Orpheum.
The Orpheum has . a local debutante this
week in the person of Miss Nina de St. Hubert,
a young violinist who plays the obligato to
Guiile's rendering of the "Aye Maria." Peo
ple familiar with the woYk will remember that
there is a long Drelude for the violin with ar
peggio accompaniment before the voice be- ,
gin . I
On Sunday the audience, in spite of the
debutante's pretty appearance and playing,
seemed unable to refrain from laughing at
litt.e Guiile as he stood mute on the platform.
Last night the prelude was omitted. All
went well, Miss St. Hubert making quite a hit.
Guiile, ln addition to the "Aye Maria," sang
an aria by Verdi.
A new act that took well was that performed
by Ara, Zelra ana Vora, clever acrobats, who
perform some remarkable balancing feats.
One of the feminine members of the troupe
balances herself on a table covered with
lighted lamps.
John and Bertha Gleason, two other new
comers, made quite a hit with their dancing,
though their singing was not of much account.
This is the last week of the ballet...

CHURCHES TURNED
INTO PLAYHOUSES
Evangelist Munhall Scores
Modern Sensation
alism.
Dr. Beard Tells What Moderate
Socialists Are Doing in
London.
Rev. W. Tubb Upbraids Congregational
Pastors With Their Ignorance
of History.
More in a spirit of pity than of wrath,
Evangelist Munhall talked of modern ag
nosticism and atheism at the Presbyterian
Ministerial Association yesterday, and
dealt modern unbelievers hard blows.
lie opened his remarks by quoting the
Scotch divine who said that to-day misses
I who are not sure of the multiplication ta
ble are sure they are unbelievers, and
youths yet in tbeir teens call themselves
agnostics, when they cannot describe the
word, nor even spell it. The evangelist
described the brilliant skeptics of the last
century, particularly Voltaire and Lord
Bolinsbroke, and said that the hopeful
sign of the decadence of unbelief lies in
comparing their brilliancy with the infe
riority of modern skeptics.
Alluding to sensationalism, tbe speaker
strongly disapproved of the action of some
men who "in their desire to fill their
churches have turned them into play
houses, no matter whether for Shakes
peare or for scriptual drama, such as the
Ten Virgins. It has always been my
experience that the results of sensational
ism are disastrous." The speaker said be
upheld divinely appointed means for the
propagation of the gospel, and said that
for his part he was an old fogey, if to
believe in the Bible, in theology and in
creeds meant being an old fogey. "I
believe that a man who has not in his
heart a clear-cut conviction. that the Bible
is the work of God, will never do much
good in the pulpit," and this sentiment
was heartily applauded by the ministers
present.
When in England and Scotland last year
Rev. Dr. Beard made a special study of
the various charitable organizations, and
yesterday be read a paper on "London
Charities" at the Methodist preachers'
meeting. The doctor stated that the an
nual income of London charities is $27,
--000,000, but that this is much less than the
amount actually expended in charity, as
many charitable organizations make no
public report at all. The amount of Gov
ernment and municipal help afforded to
dependent classes is almost appalling to
an American, and tbe large amounts
given in private charity have resulted in a
serious sentimental and legal Invasion of
the privileges of the upper clashes.
Dr. Beard concluded by describing some
of the work achieved by the London
County Council, which he said was a body
| of wealthy men said to be moderate so-
I cialists, using the privileges accorded to
i them by the law in dealing with some of
tbe problems of poverty by means of im
proved housing conditions.
The meeting appointed Dr. Dille, Dr.
Case and Dr. Bovard a committee to draft
I a proposed constitutional amendment
with regard to educational institutions
j being exempt from taxation.
Rev. James Small addressed the Chris
tian pastors on the subject of revivals, in
the beneficent results of which he ex
pressed an abiding belief. He paid a
high tribute to the mental ana moral
worth of Evangelist Munhall, and added:
"I think Professor Jordan's fling was
wholly uncalled for, though it is my opin
ion that he ii in favor of legitimate revi
vals. It was a mistake to bring personal
ities into the discussion. Professor Jor
dan's change of views, if he ever had a
change, have no place in the controversy,
and are only calculated to injure his
standing with orthodox Christians. The
question ought to be discussed on its mer
its. Professor Jordan had a magnificent
standing in the Christian College in Indi
ana, where he was an instructor."
The Congregational Ministers' Club met
for the fir.-*t time in its new quarters in the
Y. M. C. A. building yesterday morning,
and to Rev. Dr. G. Adams of the First
Church fell the pleasure of reading the
first paper in the new rooms'. His subject
was "William, Prince of Orange." He
followed the champion of Protestantism
through all his trials and victories to his
death.
A number of pastors discussed the paper.
When the turn of Rev. William Tubbcame
to speak he said that he regretted to find
such a deplorable lack of historical knowl
edge among the pastors present. "Many
of them," he said, '"confound historical
characters. They seem to have no clear
idea of history, and get mixed up in the
historical personages. If the theological
colleges do not turn out better informed
ministers in the future than they have in
the past, I think it would be advisable to
j refer the graduates back to the public
I schools." ______________^____
KRIEGERS AT BANQUET.
Germans Love America While
Kindly Remembering the
Fatherland.
The fourth anniversary of the Deutschen
Krieger Verein was celebrated by a ban
quet at the Turn Vereiu Vorwaerts' hall
last night.
There were a numberof honorary quests
and the festivities were continued until
NEW TO-DAT.
BRAINY QUESTS.
Frequently Hate Trouble With What
Is Found on Fashionable Tables.
Ii has been discovered by some of the
society ladies in some of tbe lai ger cities
that a number of the most esteemed guests
at their "functions" are more or less dis-
agreeably affected by coffee, tbis fact be-
ing particularly observable among the
brillant and brainy ones. To meet the
want of coffee fanciers with whom the
subtle beverage does not agree, Postum,
the health coffee, has been quite largely
introduced in fashionable quarters. This
is a sinsularly appetizing drink made
from cereals (wheat, etc.), by the Postum
Cereal Company, Limited, Battle Creek,
Mich., which incidentally looks and smells
like fine coffee, but instead of producing
the unpleasant disturbances with the di-
gestive organs, as coffee does in number-
less cases, it agrees perfectly with the
weakest stomach and is nourishing and
fattening, being made wholly from pure
grains. It can be served strong as an after
dinner coffee with perfect success as to
looks, taste and effect upon the guests.
A reliable grocer will never offer a cbeap
or weak imitation of a genuine original
article because he happens to make a little
extra profit. But it is well to observe thÂ«.
when genuine Postum cereal coffee is or-
dered, that 'you get Postum and not a
I spurious imitation offered as "just as
| good."
past midnight. They consistea largely of
music and toasts. ~-r .."â 
The principal speech of the evening was
by the toastmaker, Robert Wienecke.
Among other things he said: â¢"
Comrades, ladies and gentlemen: We are
met this evening around this festive board to
celebrate the fourth anniversary of the shoot
ing section of the German Krieger Verein In a
fitting and suitable manner. The German
Krieger Verein (veteran association) is an or
ganization which has made it its object to
keep alive and fresh in the memories of its
members the glorious deed? of arras of united
Germany's army, and to recall at gatherings
like this the great and historical occurrences
on the fietd of battle of tnat grand army of
which we were members. Within our organi
zation It is particularly the shooting section
which has added to and maintained the mili
tary branch ol the Krieger Verein to the social
association, comuosed of veterans of the Ger
man arm .
My d riends. extending to you a hearty wel
come, ana knowing that many of our honored
guests have fought for our new and adopted
fatherland, I propose as the first toast
of the evening, "America ana Germany":
but before I call for a response to this toast I
will add a few words in English for the
benefit of those ot our guests who are not fa
miliar with the German language.
And now, for the benefit of our iriends and
guests who have honored us this evening by
their presence, and who are not familiar with
our German language, I will say that this is
the fourth anniversary of the shooting section
of the German Krieger Verein. While we all
are and desire to become American citizens,
we have retained ln our hearts the love for
our dear fatherland the land where our
cradle stoodâ the land for the unity and in
tegrity of which many of us fought on bloody
fields.
But these sentiments do not interfere with
our patriotism for our new ana adopted coun
try. I erasure I voce the feelings of all my
comrades when I say: That should necessity
require our military services we will be just
as patriotic and devoted soldiers for this, our
glorious republic, as we have been for the
land of our birth.
With love for the old fatherland and with
patriotic fervor for our new fatherland, the
most glorious country of the world, I
bid you welcome and hope you will join with
us in the festivities of this evening. And
now I repeat that the first toast of the evening
is "America and Germany," and I call upon
General Â£. S. Salomon to respond to this toast.
Captain F. J. Wisker of Garrison 101,
Army and Navy Union, drank to the
health of the verein and made a short
speech. Toasts were responded tobvW^ice-
Consul Lohan and by Baron J. W. yon
Schroeder, Captain Kuhls, Captain Oldeg
and Captain Siebe, representing the Em
tracbt. Red Men's and Shell Mound sec
tions respectively. It was nearly 1 o'clock
when the music ceased and thu guests dis
persed. â 
QUACKENBUSH'S DENIAL.
Declares That He Never Signed a Mar
riage Contract With Mrs. Abbot t-
Quackmnbuah.
Tbomas M. Quaccenbush testified in his
own bebalf yesterday in tbe case brought
against him by Mrs. Nancy Abbott-Qaac-;
enbush for $500 permanent maintenance,
claiming that right on account of a mur
riage contract which she avers was signed
by them several yeara ago.
Mr. Quackenbush is too sick to appear
in court and so Judge Seawell and the at
torneys went to the Quackenbush resi
dence, 911 Webster street, to hear the tes
timony of the old man, who is nearly 76
years of age.
Quackenbush'*! evidence was practically
a general denial of Mrs. Abbott's asser
tions. He stated emphatically that he
had never beer, married to her and that
he had not signed the alleged marriage
contract which she has produced. He said
he lived in the house kept by Mrs. Abbott
simply as her lodger.
He said be paid her $16 a month for his
room and from 15 to 25 cents for his meals.
At different times he signed money orders
and other papers, but never anything that
resembled a marriage contract, so far as
he knew. He did not dispute his signa
tures in all cases, but said if be signed
those documents he did not know what
they contained.

Portland, and I was interested in him to-
day for nearly two hours. We spoke of
the result of the new bond issue, and we
agreed in looking forward to a good spring

GREAT HOME REMEDY,
JOY'S VEGETABLE SARSAPARILLA.
"To tell you the truth, all of the regular
guests of the Quimby House had spoken to
me so highly of Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla that I was induced to try it, and the
result is simply marvelous. I am now a
strong and vigorous man. I suffered very
much from biliousness and liver com-
plaint. I can truly indorse Joy's Vegeta-

A DANGEROUS INTRUDER.
To Be Sternly Grappled With and
Quickly Thrown Out.
"Once more in the clutches of my old
enemy, the grip," you say some morning
when you wake up coughing and sneezing.
Your eyes are watery, your head feels as if
some force inside of it were bent on split*
ting it as a charge of gunpowder splits a
rock. Every muscle is t,tiff and sore.
Your very bones ache.
Oh, we all Know the symptoms of the
grip. A steady draught through an open
door, a pair of wet feet left undried too
lone, or a short walk in the cutting air
without an overcoat, and the mischief is
done.
how shall it be undone? Evidently
there is only one remedy. The blood must
move more briskly on its way, so as to
warm the tissues near the skin, and at the
same time relieve from congestion the
sluggish organs lying deep in the body.
And what will accomplish this? An.
swer: Only a vare stimulant to stir, stim
ulate and rouse the powers and throw the
intruding grip out of the system. Nature
must be assisied. The only known pure
medicinal stimulant is Duffy's pure malt
whiskey. "A stitch in time -ayes nine"
is an adage that would never Uave grown
so ol'i if it did not embody an iruperish
p.ble truth. Remember this ancient say
ing and take Duffy's pure mult whiskey at
the first chilly symptom that the grip is
near.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
THE FAKE AM THE FACT.
THE PAKE
The Examiner published for several days at the
top of its title page the following fake:
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
249,757 Inches
Of Ads During J 896.
5964 More
Than were published by any
other San Francisco newspaper.
In the publication of this fake the Examiner
was probably not aware that a careful record was
being kept of the actual amount ln Inches of its
advertising and that in consequence it could be
confronted with the following fact.
THE FACT
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
236,528 Inches
Of Ads During J 896.
That is one fact and here is an-
other :
THE CALL PUBLISHED
239,551 Inches
Of Ads During 896.
3,023 More
Inches were published in
THE CALL than in the
Examiner during J 896.
It Is to be remembered that daring 1896 the
Examiner published approximately 800 inches of
illegal lottery advertisements, of which Thk Call
did not and would not publish one.
The monarch of the lasers has doubtless suc-
ceeded in securing thousands of Inches of adver-
tising during the past year by dupin? and deceiv-
ing advertisers through false and arrogant asser-
tions of the character of the foregoing fake. It
would seem, however, from the facts that the
merchants as a rule have not been misled by Its
fraudulent pretenses.
The Examiner boasts that its books are open to
Inspection, but we suggest that it inspect Its own
books before it venture* udod the publication of
another fake.
We congratulate the public on the fact that the
Pxrosure of this fake led the Examiner to drop It.
In this the Examiner waa discreet, and if lt is wise
it will make no more such bold attempts to
deceive the public
I .
Carnival days are coming.
A
Forty cities are getting ready for frolics.
The only fitness the Czar has shown for
getting himself noted is epileptic.
. .
Congress is now near enough adjourn-,
ment to see the end of everything except
talk.
Â»
The Bradley-Martin ball may cost more,
but it won't be as big as a California car
nival.
.
There are signs that most people are
getting ready to ignore St. Valentine
again.
Nevada ought to call its coming prize
fight a fiesta or a carnival and throw a
rosy glory over it.
There are differences of opinion on re
ligious revivals, but when it comes to trade
revivals all are agreed.
Bierce has at last struck the level of his
second childhood and is now driveling in
an attempt to imitate the wit of a preco
cious four-year-old.
The sensation of the town at present
are the offenses of the suspected Butler
and the convicted Examiner, but fortu
nately we shall soon be rid of both.
The Legislature is sufficiently virtuous
to resent attacks on it by the Sacramento
papers and there is talk now of moving
the capital to some place where mud isn't
to handy.
War against decadent journalism is
being waged as effectually in New York as
in San Francisco, and before lone it will
be a very shameless man who will be will
ing to be seen reading a paper of that
kind.
*
We have forced the Examiner to drop
the braggart lie that it published more
inches of ads duriug 1896 than any other
San Francisco newspaper by showing that
The Call published over 3000 inches more
than tbe boastful faker. One more victory
for truth.
According to statistics collected by the
Manufacturers' Record, the total value of
all breadstuff exports for 1896 .-.mounted to
$176,000,000 against $121,000,000 in 1895.
The continuance of the drouth in India
promises an even larger export this year,
and the outlook for farmers shows pros
pects of a break in the long depress. on
which has weighed upon their industry.
"If Hearst," said Bierce, "takes railroad
pay
And sells himself to shame that way;
No more I'll write him prose or verse,
No pander I to courtesan or worse."
Hearst sold himself, he took the pay,
Bierce writes for" him the same old way.
The reason why is plain enough â
fierce himself got part the stuff.
ROBBING THE POOR.
*, --: ,_.â¢_â â¢ <i. â Â»,**â -,. . _â â -_â¢'_
A correct estimate of the character of the managers of the Examiner MB be had
only by bearing in mind that they use that paper to rob the poor as well as the rich.
It is not at preat corporations alone that they direct tlieir boodling schemes. All is
fish that comes into their nets, nnd they have fakes by which to catch the pennies ol
the poor as well as schemes by which to extort the dollars of the wealthy.
One of the methods they use to obtain money from those who can ill afford to lose
it is to lend themselves to the service of swindling lottery companies, and to publish
as true false report* of drawings made by Mich companies and prizes given by them.
From these swindlers the managers of the mi 'nn- get many dollars to put into the
pocket of Mr. Hearst to enable him to retain his lampooners and blackmailers when
subsidies from corporations run out.
Not content with serving swindling lotteries, the Examiner frequently resorts to
lottery schemes of its own. It offers prizes of every kind and description from a
yard of pups to a town lot for persons who will take the chances of putting
their money into the hands of Long Green and his sansr, in the expectation of draw
ing a premium. These tricks also have paid well in the past, and have helped the
estate of the late Senator Hearst to bear the financial strain which his wasteful son
places on it.
Another scheme by which it works the pockets of the people is what is known as
the "charity dodge." Money ostensibly for charitable purposes is raised by the
Examiner gang, either by direct contribution from the people or by baseball games,
"tug-of-war" tournaments and simiiar methods. From the sums which are received
in this way underthe pretense of charity large and greedy deductions are made in the
form of expenses. Tnese deductions have all tho appearance of legitimate items. It
cannot be expected, of course, that even a faker can run his fakes without pay, but
the Examiner makes the pay abnormally large in proportion to the amount which it
gives away in order to keep up the semblance of a reputation.
The lesser fakes and schemes devised to gather pennies from the poor are too
numerous to mention. They are of all classes and descriptions. They include
chromos given to any one who will bring in a fifteen-cent advertisement, and offers of
a chance to get a farm to any one who will subscribe 'the. disreputable paper. The,
managers have at limes offered to give every subscriber to their weekly fake a chance
to get his weight in gold. Nothing is too farcical, nothing is too fraudulent for these
unscrupulous rascals to practice in their efforts to obtain from the people the money
necessary to maintain them in carrying on their unprofitable and vicious lives.
The Examiner is in fact an all-round boodler. It defrauds when it can and where
it cannot defraud it resorts to extortion. It swindles tbe poor as eagerly as it black
mails the rich. It retains men who have the cunning to wheedle a dollar from the
credtilous just as it employs Bierce aft 1 other lampooners to revile, malign, abuse,
calumniate and belie rich men and corporations when it thinks by so doing it can
obtain thousands of dollars from them.
It is gratifying to note that all over the Union the cry against the decadent jour
nalism which Willie Hearst is promoting with the estate of h.3 father is being de
nounced with the severity of righteous indi.nalion. In New York the war against
Mr. Hearst's Journal is being waged as vigorously as is the contest sgainst the Ex
aminer here. The current number of the Chap Book, commenting upon the Journal
and papers of that class, says: "They ransack libraries of erotic literature when their
own imaginations begin to fail, their news is ways vulgar, trivial, sensational and,
as a minor detail, false. Nothing is too inane or too obscene for them to print. They
are a daily libel on everybody and everything."
This is the kind of paper which under the management of Long Greea Lawrence
and the proprietorship of Willie Hearst has been seeking to maintain its existence by a
thousand fakes and frauds since the Southern pacific cut it off the payroll. It is not
rich men only who must be on guard against it. It aims at everybody, and turns
willingly from blackmailing corporations to robbing the poor.
CONTEMPT OP COURT.
Various issues which have arisen of late i
years have called public attention repeat
edly to the contempt of court law in this |
State, and not a few cases have exposed
the injustice which is possible under it.
An attempt was made to remedy the evil
by the passage of the Barry law of 1891,
but this has been declared by Judge Cat
lin of Sacramento to be unconstitutional. !
In order to secure the rights of the peo- I
ple against a possible decision of the Su
preme Court sustaining that of Judge â 
Catlin it will be necessary to amend the |
constitution Itself, and there is a good I
prospect that the Legislature will at this '
session submit such an amendment to the
people.
The proposed amendment consists of in
serting into section 9 of article I of the
constitution the words, "No speech or ;
publication refiectine upon, or concerning i
any court, or any officer thereof, shall be j
treated or punished as a contempt of
court unless made in the immediate pres
ence of such court while in session, and
in such a manner as to actually interfere
with its proceedings."
The amendment will not be a radical :
innovation in American law. It is in fact,'
a verbatim copy of the present United \
States statute governing all Federal courts. |
Its adoption will simply place the courts of
California on a level wiih those of the Na
tion so far as contempt cases are con- {
cerned, and will secure the people and the j
press in the right of free speech and just j
criticism of all public officials, judicial or
otherwise.
As the law stands at present a corrupt |
judge could punish for contempt sum- j
marily and without trial any citizen to j
whose criticisms or condemnation he took '
exception. It is time this condition ol
the law should be changed. The people I
cordially approved the Barry law and I
since that has been declared unconstitu
tional, it is important that the Legisla
ture should at once take steps toward
amending the constitution so as to make
it a true charter of the rights of the people. i
FARMS IN ENGLAND.
The condition of agriculture in England
has long been of a nature so disastrous,
both to land-owners and lease-holders, as
to produce among them a state of chronic
discontent. Recently, however, affairs
have gone from bad to worse and at tho
present time they are in a condition so
hopeless that Lord Salisbury is reported
to have declined to receive a deputation
of farmers on the expressed ground that
he knew of his own knowledge all they
had to complain of, but could see no way
of remedying the evils.
Some recently compiled reports of sales
of farm property in England show to
what extent the depression has been car
ried. At the sale of Langdon Abbey, 639
acres of land, with farmhouse, stabling,
homestead and seven modern cottages,
only realized Â£5700, or less tban Â£9 per
acre. Fifteen years ago the property was
valued at over Â£20,000, and four years ago
It was mortgaged for Â£14,000. In Essex
County, within a day's walk of the Bank
of England, a farm which, in 1875, rented
for Â£400, has for the last live years rented
for Â£1 per annum, the occupant paying
the taxes, amounting to about Â£150. In
many cases farms have been sold for less
than one-tenth of their value twenty years
ago.
Bad as this condition is, it is rendered
worse by the fact that there seems to be
no hopeful outlook for the farming indus
try of England in the future. The only
possible help would be the establishment
of a high protective tariff on farm
products; but that would impose such a
burden upon the great mass of the British
population that they will never consent to
it. The commercial and manufacturing
prosperity in England depends upon
cheap food and cheap raw material. Those
inteiests combined are too large to be sac
rificed for the farmers, or even for the
great land-owners. Well indeed might
Lord Salisbury say that he cares to hear
no more on the subject. He is himself
one of . the largest land-owners in the
kingdom, as well as Prime Minister, and
neither as a landlord nor as a statesman
can he see any way to save British agri
culture from the impending ruin.
The Maine Legislature is discussing a
bill for the relief of farmers whose crops
have been destroyed by deer, and as the
State insists on protecting the deer lt
seems like a square deal.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 189,7.
MINES AND PARMER.
It is gratifying to learn from Sacra
! mento that the miners and farmers of the
' State have at last found a basis of agree
ment upon which it is possible to enact
legislation that will be beneficial to both
and will enable hydraulic miner, to pro
ceed with their wor_c without injury to
j the farm districts of the valleys or to the
J great rivers whose channels are necessary
j to the commerce of the Stale.
As a result of this agreement, we can
i reasonably look forward to such legisla
| tion as will be necessary to make available
| for use the $250,C0'_* already appropriated
! for the purpose of constructing restraining
dams in the mountains, so that the debris
will not be washed down by the rivers into
the valleys below. Ono of the most impor
tant bills of the session deals with this sub
; ject and on its face eives every guarantee
I necessary to guard the public in the ex
; penditure of the money.
It will be remembered that the United
\ States Government appropriated $250,000
to carry out work of constructing restrain
, ing dams under control of a California
j Debris Commission, created by act of Con
gress March 1, 1393. The proposed bill
I provides for a State Debris Commissioner
to consult and advise with the commission
; created by Congress and report all plans
! and specifications to the State lioard of
Examiners for their supervision. It is
j nrovided that whenever the National De
j bris Commission shall have undertaken
i any part of the proposed work the State
j shall pay one-half of it subject to approval
I of the State Board of Examiners.
It will be seen that no new appropri
ation is asked for, and the proposed bill
j simply prescribes the manner in which
! the money may be used. The engineers
of the United States estimate that
j the cost of dams sufficient to keep the
| debris of the mountains out of the
; American, Feather and Sacramento rivers
will be about $490,000. The appropriations
| of the General Government and the State
I combined amount to $500,000, and seem
I therefore adequate to carry the enterprise
to a successful completion.
There can be no question but what the
i work should be begun as speedily as pos
sible. There are thousands of people in
| the State who need employment and it is
full time the great interests of the miners
} and the farmers should receive attention.
I The bill on its face seems a fair one in
I every respect, and there can be little ques-
I tion that the people will be glad to see the
! work begun, the money put into circula
j tion and hydraulic mining resumed with
out injury to the valleys or the rivers.
The Spanish Government will need no
I trocha around the reforms promised to
Cuba. The Cubans won't take them.
_
Senator-elect Mason of Illinois declares
he will never be silent in the Senate until
Cuban belligerency is recognized. Fortu
nately he talks well.
Altgeld's recent remark that "Illinois
will surely shapa the destinies of the
Nation" looks like a crude attempt to
resume pleasant relations with Chicago.
"Whether it was the power of the' press or
j the power of tbe pulpit that drove him to
| it is not clear, but the clamor against his
j $250,000 ball has induced Bradley-Martin
j to seek public favor by giving $10 to a
fund for the relief of the pfjor of New York.
The St. Louis Qlobe-Democrat says that
as the assassinations committed by high
binders are confined entirely to Chinese,
public sentiment in San Francisco is not
very strongly against them. That is the
kind of news you hear when you go away
from home. '
The State has already appropriated
$250,000 for the construction of impound
ing dams and the General Government has
appropriated an equal amount. The next
appropriate step, therefore, would be to
arrange for beginning the work and put
j ting the money into circulation.
=
In deciding the cigarette trust to be an
unlawful combination the New York
courts, it seems, were under the necessity
of declaring cigarettes to be not a luxury
but a necessary of life, and, nnder the cir
cumstances, it might bave been better to
let the trust stand.
= -
Texas claims, through the mouth of her
Lieutenant-Governor, to have more pine
j land than Oregon, more granite than New
| Hampshire, to have produced more corn
I than Illinois, more cotton than any two
otber States and more rice than South
Carolina. All the same Texas is not in it
with California â she has neither an elysian
climate, a golden soil, a prune crop nor
prize pumpkins.

DECADENT JOURNALISM.
The Chap Book.
Several English writers of good standing, In
ignorance of what the papers are really like,
have done some harm to their American repu
tation by allowing their work to appear in the
New York World and Journal. These authors,
of course, dispose of their writings through an
agent. The agent sells them to a syndicate,
and the syndicate scatters them broadcast
through the papers of the United States. The
author may or may not be informed in what
journals his work is appearing. Even if
he does know their names, the odds
are greatly against his knowing what
is thought of their character on this
side the Atlantic. It is, therefore, an act of
kindly charity to warn him against the New
York World and Journal. No decent man
ever reads them. They circulate among
people who like their murders fully lllus
ttated, and their society scandals adorned
with every suggestion of indecency. They
would not for one moment be tolerated in
Loudon. Their columns are given over to
multifarious appeals to pruriency. They in
terest themselves in the exploitation of anat
omy and pathology. They publish photo
graphs with full explanatory descriptions of
all the diseases they can find in the New York
hospitals. They send out men to lie across
window-sills and peer through the
blinds into the parlors of private
houses. They send out women to ba
accosted in tbe streets. They dispatch report
era to feign madness and so gain admission
into insane asylums. They give the most ex
plicit aescriptions with illustrations of a hun
dred different ways in which murder can be
committed. They ransack libraries of erotic
literature when their own imaginations begin
to fall. This news is always vulgar, trivial,
sensational, and, as a minor detail, false.
Nothing Is too inane or too obscene
lor them to print. They are a daily
libel on everybody and everything.
For over a year has this contest lor the
primacy of the sewers raged between them.
The World is experienced in every form of
beastliness; but the Journal, which is edited
by a Harvard graduate, has only just cele
brated its first anniversary of film. Every
respectable paper bas attacked them; almost
every minister preached against them ; but the
number of their readers continues to Increase.
And tnese are the papers in which well-known
English authors have Inadvertently allowed
their work to be printed. For their own s_.kes,
If for nothing else, it is to be hoped they will
in future direct their agents to place a ban on
the New York World and Journal.
SHORT CUB/.N PUFFS
Philadelphia Press.
The Cuban tobacco yield the past year has
been 75,000 bales, instead of 500,000 bales,
the yield the year before. The sugar crop has
been reduced to a fourth of its former size,
and will be smaller during the coming year.
These figures are a fair measure of tbe terri
tory overrun or occupied by the insurgents.
Most of the tobacco is grown in Pinar del Rio,
and there nearly nine-tenths of the planta
tions have been laid waste. Of the sugar
plantations three-quarters were nnable to
grind sugar. Six weeks ago the Spanish
forces seemed to be accomplishing something.
They are no longer. They have been unable
to complete their work in Pinar del Rio, and
In all the rest of the island the Insurgent
forces are more successful than ever.

Letters From the People.
THE STANFORD TAX.
A Plea for Justice If the Tax Is Re
mitted.
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sib: A bill to free
Stanlord University from taxation ls now be
fore the State Legislature. The question as to
the justice and wisdom of removing a $30,
--000 burden from an institution that benefits
the State to so great an extent is one upon
which there may be some difference of opin
ion. But there can be but one opinion con
cerning the free of Stanford from taxation.
To do this would be to commit a great injus
tice, for the reason that the burden would lail,
not equally upon the people of the State, who
share equally ln the benefits derived, but by
far the larger portion would of necessity be
borne by the people of the counties in which
the university property is. The State tax. of
course, would be evenly divided, but the
county tax is always larger than that of the
State.
True, it may be said that the people of the
connty in which the university is, are more
than repaid for the additional taxation by the
benefit derived from the hundreds of students,
each bringing money to pay for his supnort
while pursuitl.T his studies. But it must be
remembered that the university owns prop
erty of many kinds in many counties, It owns
thousands of acres of land. If all this'prop
erty should be made untaxable the people of
those counties would bear by far the greater
portion of the burden. This is unjust for they
get no more good from the university than do
the people ol other counties.
If we as a people wish to present Stanford
with a early gilt of .'&.0.000 on account of its
beneficial influence, let us do it in a just way,
not "rob Peter to pay Paul." Very respect
fully, B. R. Burroughs.
MUNICIPAL HUMANITY.
The Christ Spirit Incarnate in a Muni'
ctpal Body.
To the Editor of the San Fiancisco Callâ Sir:
More than anything else in the world, so far
as I am able to judge, these five words have
influenced my life: "Who went about doing
good" (Acts x: 38), which was Peter's explana
tion of the mission of Jesus of Nazareth as
given to Cornelius of Cesarea, the centurion,
"a just man and, one that loved God." The
Christ spirit, as I understand it, is revealed in
all Its grandeur and breadth when He said,
"For I was an hungered and ye gave me meat;
I was thirsty and ye gave me drink; i was a
stranger and ye took me in: naked, and ye
clothod me; I was sick and ye visited me; I
was in prison and ye came unto me. " ' 'Verily,
I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it
unto the least of tne.se, my brethren, ye have
done lt unto me." (Matt, xxy : 35, 30 and 40.)
There is a scene pictured in the Acts of the
Apostles Tfhlch should be recalled here : "They
that gladly received the word were baptized,"
to the number of "about three thousand
souls." "And fear came upon every soul; ana
many wonders and signs were done by the
apostles. And all that believed wero together."
They "sold their possessions and goods and
parted them to all as every man had need."
(Acta 11, 41, 43, 44. 45.) This was the spirit
which animate'! the first converts to Chris
tianity alter the Christ had parted from the
apostles and was the first fruits of their
preaching after they were baptized with the
Holy Spirit. The impulse io help those in
want seems to be in full accord with the Christ
spirit
We pass over the history of the race for 1900
years and enter, "gay and wicked Paris,"
where tbe spirit, made manifest in "The Luck
of Roaring Camp" rather than that of "The
Scarlet Letter," appears to be in the ascend
ant, to see in what ways and to what extent
the Christ spirit has entered into the muni
cipal life of the people; though I am aware
that people who are the lineal descendants of
those who pass beiore us in the pages of tbe
"Scarlet Letter" may feel a distinct shock at
the transition from the apostles to Paris. But
I am looking for practical results, and. for
years past have paid little court to sentiment.
Turning to page 102 of Albert Shaw's re
markable and invaluable book on "Municipal
Government in Continental Europe," we read
that "public charity has absorbed and system
lied almost every important form and agency
of relief and succor." To this "Assistance
Publique," as be points out, "belong (1) the
great hospitals of Paris; (2) the homes, asylums
and retreats lor the aged poor and special
groups of dependent classes, and (3) the super
vision and support of domiciling relief,
whether in the form of medical attendance,
temporary succor with money, food or fuel, or
regular and permanent aid at home in lieu of
support in a public, institution." "In the
hands of this great boarJ of public charity
rests tne policy that expends a yearly revenue
of some thirty million francs. "' "Accommo
dations for about 30,000 patients and inmates
are provided in the hospitals and retreats."
'The most skillful physicians are employed
by the. City in large numbers "to secure for
the poor in their homes an attentive and skill
ful ministry of medical relief," as well as
trained and skill ul nurses, free of cost to the
patients. Page 107: "In recent years no part
of the work of public assistance has been more
carefully developed than that which relates
to the rescue, maintenance and proper in
struction of friendless children. "In the
ca" of every unfortunate child the munici
pality alms to be very much more than a
grudging stepfather." Great results are des
tined to follow.
Mr. Shaw informs us that 'in a remarkable
variety of ways the Parisian municipality
plays the role of prompt friend and servitor to
its people in times of emergency and special
misfortune. But far more important is the
service of night medical and â Â«*Â»Â«} relief,
organized in every neighborhood of the me
tropolis" "The municipal lodging
are absolutely free of charge. They
have a. _ capacity of 600 per night.
Each guest is provided with a change of
clothing while present and soup is served at
night; bread in the morning." The stay is
limited to three days. The women's lodging
house allows women to bring their children
and affords them shelter and care, the average
sojourn being nearly a month.
Rent money is advanced by the municipal
ity very liberally in cases where worthy fami
lies through illness or other misfortune have
been evicted by their landlords and have no
means with which to rent a new domicile;
and from fifteen to twenty thousand families
are eacn year helped in this way. Free
bureaus of employment are maintained in
nearly every ward of the city. But there is a
great central labor exchange, opened ln 1892,
costing 2,000,000 francs, which has become
headquarters for not less than eighty-two
trades unions, and 50,000 francs are annually
appropriated to maintain it. These .trades
unions may hid for public work.
I ought to devote a half column to the pub
lic pawnshop, which has been in operation
since 1777, and will reserve it for another let
ter, as its importance and practical benefi
cence demand such consideration. I shall
then present some suggestions to the citizens
of San Francisco on the wisdom of municipal
humanity. Joseph Asbury Johnson.

TWENTY CHANCES
TO GAIN FAME
Valley Road Open to Hints
as to Names for New
Stations.
Superintendent McFarland Going
to Fresno to Push Exten
sion Work.
Telegraph and Trains Will Be Kept
to the Front of the Track
and Grading.
There are now only a few comparatively
minor obstacles in the rignt of way of the
San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railroad between Fresno and Bakersfield,
and the construction department, under
Chief Engineer Storey, is showing in
creased activity in the making of prepara
tions for construction work. There are
but a few more finishing touches of engi
neering work to be put on.
When the construction work is begun it
will be pushed with all the dispatch that
insures a first-class roadbed. When the
first 125 miles of the line, from Stockton
to Fresno, were completed the Valley
road then had as good and as well bal
lasted a track as there was in the State,
and in some respects railroad men said it
was as level, well jointed and solid as it is
possible to construct.
The first excursion train that went
through from Stockton to Fresno for tho
celebration at the latter city last October
of the opening of the Valley road was
drawn by a locomotive that had two days
before run with two coaches from Clans
ton to Stockton, a distance of thirty miles,
at a rate of nearly sixty miles per hour.
The locomotive had just come from the
shops and was being "warmed up" for
heavier work ahead of her. There are few
newly constructed roadbeds in tbe conn
try on which this rate of speed would
have been safe.
Chief Engineer Storey said yesterday
that the roadbed from Fresno to Bakers*
field would be as well graded and the
track as {rood as the division north of
Fresno. The distance from Fresno to
Bakersfield is about 120' miles as surveyed.
Superintendent E. A. McFarland of
Stockton, who has charge of the division
to Fresno, will have nia headquarters
changed to Fresno on the 15th inst., to
take charge of the work on the extension
to Bakersfield. About 400 men will be
employed in grading and tracklayinsr.
Poles will be set and wire stretched in
pace with tho construction work, so that,
telegraph instruments and trains can be
kept within jumping off distance of the
front end of battle. The company wants
to get trains running into Bakerslield by
the middle of June. Trains will probably
be run regularly to Hanford, about thirty
miles south of Fresno, soon after the track
is built to that place. There are still some
impediments yet in the right of way to
Visalia.
The company is not waiting for funds
on account of tbe issuance of its bonds to
make the extension. The proofs of the
bonds were read about ten days ago, by
I Vice-President Robert Watt, and returned
to New York, where they are now being
printed. Mr. Watt said tnat the company
would not be in any hurry to dispose of
the bonds.
There must be stations and, if stations,
names for them, on the new extension.
This will receive the attention of Chief
Engineer Storey beiore the line reaches
Bakersfield. This was found to be a puz
zling question to some degree when the
names had to be selected for the seventeen
stations south of the "Mill City" not pre
viously determined by settled communi
ties of some pretension to population.
But the directors are said to nave entered
into hearty unanimity when it was pro
posed to name the places of future
great metropolitan aspirations, after the
president of the road, Glaus Spreckels. So
Clauston got on the map, and who knows
that some day it may not be donated a
patronymic town hall or a beet-sugar fac
tory with a thousand employes. The sta
tions will be fourteen to twenty in number.
Chief Engineer storey said that the road
is open to suggestions for names for the
stations from the pioneer, the farmer, the
fruit-grower and packer, the businessman,
to the young husband or country swain
who wants the name of his first-born son
or sweetheart to be sounded down the
ages by the angel-voiced brakeman.

TO CARRY COD IN
LIEU OF WHALES
The Old Herriman Changed
From a Bark Into a
Barkentine.
Another Whaler Has Been
Turned Into "an Otter Hunt
ing Schooner.
Many People on the Front Yesterday
Mistook tbe Olivebank for
the Swanhilda.
The British ship Olivebank, in which i
Butler, the man accused of murdering Lee j
Weller and Arthur Preston, served as an J
A. B. under the name of Robert Ashe, '
made the prettiest picture in tho bay yes
terday. "While battling with adver.-e
winds outride Captain Petrie had no op
portunity to dry any of his sails, so yes
terday when the barometer was steadily
: rising and all the indications were for line
weather the canvas was spread to the
I northerly breeze, and before nightfall
! nearly ail tbe sails were dried. Many
people watched the vessel from Clay- j
i street wharf and not a few took her to be '
j the Swanhilda, and some went so far as to
I point out the particular mast to which
| Butler was assigned when the call lor "All
hands" came on a stormy night.
The Olivebank has a cargo of coal con
| signed to Balfour, Guthrie & Co., and
! after discharging will probably tie up in
i Richardsons Bay to await better times in
j the wheat trade.
The old whaling bark Emma F. Herri
i man will never go to the Arctic in chase
jof the leviathan of the deep again. She
! bad an eventful career, and made money
,' for owners both in New Bedford and
San Francisco. A year or so ago J. A.
Ma^ee, the managing owner, withdrew
her from the business and a lew months
ago sold her to the North American Trad
ing Company. Now the old timer is being
; cut down and transformed into a barken
tine for the cod-carrying trade. Formerly
she was a two-decker, but all the upper
works are being removed, and when the
ola whalers who made their home in her
year after year see her again they will not
know the new Emma F. Herriman. She
will lie low in the water, and altogether
will present as trim an appearance as any
barkentine in port.
The same company has also purchased
the whaling schooner Jane Gray and will
send her to Alaska on an otter hunting
expedition. Captain N. Hodgson will take
her to either Sand Point or Sitka and there
ship an Indian crew, after which a cruise
as far north as Copper Island will be in
order.
The sealing schooner Rattler i. not
meeting with very gocd luck. Since sbe
left here, several weeks ago, there have j
only be.-n two days on which there was an |
opportunity to lower the boats and only j
thirty-eight skins have been taken, af
though thousands of the seals were seen l
daily. Last week one of the boat-steerers j
was taken sick and the vessel had to put !
in to Monterey Bay. As he was unable j
to proceed, the captain had to land him !
and ship another man. No time was lost, '
and the schooner is now following the
herd up the coast.
The members of the Committee on Com- I
merce and Navigation were tbe guests of I
the Harbor Commissioners yesterday. !
They went for a ride around the bay on
the State tug Governor Markham, and in- i
spected the water front and the work in
progress on the ferry building. After as
certaining the needs of the seaport the
steamer was headed for San _|uentin. and j
tue rest of the day was spent in enjoying 'â 
the hospitality of Warden Hale. Presi- i
dent Coition of the Harbor Commission \
did not go any further than Lombard- !
street wharf with the party.
The bark Andrew Welch, that sailed
yesterday for Honolulu, took away an '
unusually heavy cargo. Captain Drew is j
a general favorite, so no one was sur
; prised when his list showed that there
| were twelve passengers aboard. There I
â  was a big deckload of horses, mules and
I hogs; so there will not be much room in
which to move around should tbe weather
prove rough.
The ship Elwell drifted down on the â 
cable last Saturday during the south- |
caster. When the wind changed yester
day the captain raised his anchor ana i
the tide carried him back to almost his j
old anchorage. That is one instance |
where wind and weather saved expenses. |
The ship Oriental, that made the re
markable run of four dav3 and eight hours
from here to Departure Bay. is now on her
way back to San Francisco. She was de
layed at the mines nine days and her
chances of breaking the record for a
round trip are therefore gone.
The revenue cutter Hartley, while
bound from Hunters Point to the barge
office yesterday afternoon, broke her shaft
when about off Howard-street wharf. She
was picked up by the United States steam
er George Sternberg and towed to her i
wharf.
WITH A LONG KNIFE.
George McWilliams, a Prisoner in the
City Jail, Cut His Throat.
George McWilliams, an it mate of the
City Prison, attempted suicide yesterday
morning by cutting bis throat. The un
fortunate man has recently shown signs
of softening of the brain, and Captain
Robinson, in charge of the jail, allowed
his prisoner many privileges not usually
grunted, hoping to make his lot more
bearable.
Mc Williams came to this City from his
Arizona home over a week ago. He then
had in charge a bunch of cattle con
signed to James McDerraott, the whole
sale batcher. He stopped at the Ahlborn
Honse and while under the influence of
liquor he created a disturbance. His ar
rest followed, and yesterday he paid a line
of $.0 in the Police Court.
it was so evident that the man was
mentally wrong that Captain Robinson
detained him in the prison waiting night
time, when Mr. McDermott was to come
for him. In the meantime, as McWil
liams nad refused all food for nearly a
week, the captain put him in charge of a
trusty, who was ordered to feed the man
with a bowl of soup in the kitchen.
It was while the soup was being pre
pared for him that McWilliams seized a
carving-knife and jabbed it into his throat,
severing the windpipe and an artery.
The prisoner fought desperately to com
plete his work, and four men found it a
difficult task to wrest the knife from his
grasp. â¢
Dr. Bunnell of the City Receiving Hos
pital sewed up the wounds, but there is
little hope of the man's recovery.

MASS-MEETING IN
FAVOR OF BAKERS
Big Gathering at Turk-
Street Temple Last
Evening.
___________________
Resolutions Adopted Denouncing
Opponents of Labor
Measures.
Those Present Urged to Organize for
Political Purposes Before
Election.
Several hundred laboring men answered
the call for a mass-meeting at the Turk
street Temple last evening to protest
against the efforts that are being made to
defeat two bills now before the Legis
lature that are intended to improve the
condition of the bakers.
The majority of those present seemed to
be members of the Socialist Labor party,
from the applause that frequently greeted
the mention of the name of that organiza
tion, and the speakers devoted considera
ble time to pressing the claims of the
party.
The gathering was presided over by G.
Ross Martin, who stated the object of the
meeting and said it was high time that
the labor unions protested against the
course that was being pursued by the
Manufacturers' and Employers' Associa
tion in attempting to defeat bills that
could be nothing if nor advantageous to
the working bakers.
The bills provide for the appointment
of a bakery inspector, who shall be a jour- \
neyman baker, and fix the day's labor at
ten hours, with overtime for anything in
excess of that.
R. A. Copeiand read a circular letter
sent out to business men and manufac
turers by the Manufacturers' and Em
ployers' Association asking them to write
to the representatives at Sacramento from
their districts to vote against the bills.
The chairman then read the following
resolutions, which were adopted unani
mously:
[ Whereas. There are now pending before the
i State Legislature two bills contemplating re
j flectively: (a)The enforcement of c.rtain pro
i posed sanitary regulations relative to bake-
I houses and (6) reduction of the number of
I hours per day which journeyman bakers are
| to be employed, all time over ten hours to be
regarded as overtime and to be paid at a
higher rate than that of the proposed legal
workday as provided in the bill; and whereaÂ«,
in reference to th.> bid relating to the
sanitary regulation of bakeshops the measure
is wholly practicable and necessary to the
good health of the community; and that the
bill relative to the number of hours consti
tuting a day's labor in bakehouses is com
mendable for its humanitarian purpose and
calculated to raise the moral tone and increase
the material wellbeing of a lerge body of citi
zens who in no small degree contribute,
! through their purchasing power, to the indus-
I trial aud commercial interests of the Slate;
and whereas, a non-progressive body of men
known as "The Board of Manufacturers and
â¢ Employers of California," as greedy and grasp
ing as they are shortsighted and mean-suirited,
have issued on the 28th of January last a cir
cular letter calling upon all employers in tho
State to write to the Senators and Assembly
men of their respective districs, urging them
to oppose and vote against the aforesaid bills;
and whereas, the said circular letter is not
only misleading, but false in statement and
narration of particulars, unit a credit only to
the narrow and contemptible commercial
spirit which dictated its contents; therefore
be it
Mesoleed, That having heard the reading of
such circular letter, and fully understanding i
Its spirit and purport, we, the citizens of San
1 Francisco in mass-meeting assembled, do â 
hereby denounce tne underhanded manner in
which 'he organization known as the Board
of Manulacturers and Employers of California
has undertaken to defeat the will of the peo
ple by secret special appeals to the representa
tives of the people in legislative session as
sembled; and belt further
Resolved, That while we indorse tho interest !
and provisions of the afore-mentioned bill j
we, upon moral and political grounds, wholly
disapprove of the practice of sending delega- !
dona, (rem whatever source, to legislative
bodies for the purpose of "lobbying" in the in
terest of any class, bill or measure whatsoever,
as being contrary to the genius of a repre
sentative form of government, believing that
if the individual voters nave not done their
duly at the polls the consequence of the
ignorance and negligence should fall upon
their heads without the interference of med
dlesome delegations and letter-writers that
Interfere with representatives without the j
sanction of the general body of electors.
The speakers of the evening were M. W. |
Wilkins of the Typographical Union, H. |
Warnecke of the Cigar-makers' Union,
Leo Gasser and Theodore Lynch, secre
tary of the Trades and Labor Alliance. I
.All delivered strong addresses on the sub- j
ject of tbe bills mentioned, and urged |
their hearers to organize before the next !
general election so that representatives in
Congress and tbe State Legislature m.-.y j
be elected who will b<* friendly to the in
terests of labor. Their speeches were re- j
ceived with frequent and hearty applause. I

THOUSANDS AT STAKE.
, Mayor Phelan Say-, the Jones Bill May
Cost the City J. urge Sums for Fees.
Mayor Phelan and Chief Crowley will
confer. Mayor Thelan has a matter on
hand which he considers of prime im
portance and it is very likely that he will
call upon the Chief of Police to-day. He
thinks he has discovered, in what seems
; on the face of it a comparatively harmless
measure, the possibility of an addition of
$60,000 per annum to the expenses of this
City and County without any correspond
ing benefit. This measure is known as
the Jones bill and its purpose is declared
to bo to make the Police Courts of this
City and County courts of record.
The difference between courts of record
and those that are not courts of record or
i one difference at least, is that the former
| can pay jurors for their services. So
> Mayor Phelan finds a connection between
j turning the Police Courts into courts of
record and the provisions of another law
j which gives courts of record power to pay
jurors.
"The Jones bill looks innocent enough,"
said Mayor .Phelan, "but I am satisfied
that if it shall pass it will be possible to
add $5000 per month to the City and
County's expense bill lor jurors' fees. I
have written to Senator Mahoney about
the matter, which I consider one of great
importance."
THOMAS MAGEE TO WED
The Well-Kiown Real Estate
Man Engaged to Miss Helen
Curtis
For Weeks Past the Interested Par
ties Have Kept Their Engage
ment a Secret.
Thomas Magee, tho well-known real
estate man. is to wed Miss Helen Carlton
I Curtis. For the past few weeks there
! have been rumors of the approaching
i marriage. The secret was, however, too
j good to keep, and yesterday the prospec-
I tive bride sent out little notes to her most
I intimate friends, in which she made pub-
I lie tbe pleasant news.
Miss Curtis is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs.. James Marvin Curtis, and the sister
; of Mr-. C. D. '.'Sullivan and Mrs. Cowles.
For the last few years the yonng lady
! has been most popular in her large circle
j of friends, who appreciate her on account
of her charming disposition and many
talents.
Miss Curtis was educated in this City,
but has enjoyed the advantage of an ex
tended European visit. She is an all
round accomplished girl, and excels par
ticularly as a pianist.
In appearance she is tall and slender
and has expressive deep gray eyes, wavy
dark hair and regular features.
Thomas Magee, the happy groom, is
one of the most prominent business men
of this community.
No arrangements have as yet been made
for the weddlne, which is not to take
place for several months.
TWO ACCIDENTS.
A Sergeant Injured nt Drillâ Narrow Es
cape of a Wagonload of Soldiers.
Daring oompany drill on the Presidio
parade ground yesterday Sergeant Davis
of Battery C was thrown from his horse
and had one of his shoulders dislocated.
Yesterday afternoon after the tiring of
I the first shot of the test of the 10 -inch
j breech-loading rifle at Fort Point fourteen
! men, who hud been handling the gun
| were ordered to fall in and proceed to the
Presidio Barracks for dinner. After leav
ing the firing ground the men got into one
of Uncle Sam's wagons drawn by four
mules. While making a turn in the road
the animals became fractious, and the
driver being unable to control them gave
a warning cry and the men jumped out of
the vehicle and the driver lett his seat. A
moment after the vehicle turned over an
, embankment and rolled down a long
! slope, the mules keeping comrany with
. it. When the outfit reached the bottom
the leaders broke away and ran to the
I post stables. The other animals were res
cued, but the wagon "was a wreck. None
of the men were injured.
A. P. More .Estate Litigation
Mrs Martha More Law, George S. Edwards,
assignee ot Mrs. Law, Thomas K. More and
Mary D. More have petitioned Judge Coffey to
appoint H. Clifford More administrator of the
estate of A. I*. More, deceased. The litigation
in tills estate has been going on for several
years, much to the annoyance of all the parties
in interest. An earnest effort to secure a set
tlement of the estate's tangled- affairs is now
being put forth.
Commission Merchants Accused.
W. L. Knott has sued Wolf __. Sons 0 321
Davis street for $1500, said to be due on ac
count of a deal in potatoes. Knott accuses the
defendants of having Jailed to keep proper
accounts in regard to potatoes shipped to them
as commission merchants.
IN A AND DUNE
THE MONEY GREW
Then Mrs. Mahala Robin
son's Property Went
to Others.
Fraud Is Charged Against
Rachel Macdougal and
Helen Hudgin.
It Is Alleged That They Took Ad
vantage of an 0!d Woman's
Loss of Mind.
Judge Slack is hearing testimony in the
litigation whereby Mahala F. Robinson
seeks to regain possession of valuable real
estate at the corner of O'Farrell and Tay
lor streets in this City.
Miss Ina E. Russell, a niece and guar
dian of Mrs. Robinson, instituted the pro
j ceedings against Rachel A. Macdougal
! and against Helen Â£. and John Hudgin,
: alleging that the defendants secured deeds
' to the real estate by imposing on Mrs.Rob
inson, who is said to be so old and feeble
minded that she was not competent to
transact business at the time the pre
tended transfer of the land was made.
Mrs. Robinson's history supplies an
other illustration of the ease with which
persons may become wealthy in a growing
city by purchasing corner lots and hold
ing them for rise in value. In early days
Mrs. Robinson was a domestic employed
in the family of Daniel F. Norcross. She
saved her wanes, and after accumulating
a snug sum bought a sand dune at the
spot wnich is now known as the corner of
O'Farrell and Taylor streets. Subse
quently she secured a tenant, began to
build, until now her improvements on the
land are worth about $15,000 and tee real
estate is valued at not less than $25,000,
yielding a revenue of about $300 a month.
Miss Russell alleges that the defendants,
Mr.. Macdougal and Mrs. Hudgin, de
ceived Mrs. Robinson ana induced her to
sign deeds conveying to said defendants
the title for the property in dispute, the
consideration mentioned in each case
being $10*
It is in evidence that the ostensible pur
chasers were not so exacting as they
might have been, however, for they per
mitted the old lady to occupy one of the
cottages that she formerly occupied,
charging her only $1 a year for tbe privi
lege.
Mis. Russell testified that her aunt,
Mrs. Robinson, is so old and decrepit tbat
she has altogether lost her memory. After
ncr nearest friend has been absent from
the house an hour the old lady cannot
recollect tbe name of the friend, though
she may not have altogether forgotten the
person.
No explanation has been made ofthe
manner in which Mr . Macdougal and
Mrs. Hudgin induced Mrs. Robinson to
sign the deeds, though Miss Russell im
plies that they exerted undue influence on
the old lady during the last sickness of
her husband. Mrs. Hudgin is a teacher
and leader in Christian Science circles
and Mrs. Macdougal is one of her disci
ples. The ministrations of tbe Christian
Scientists were not efficient in saving the
life of Mrs. Robinson's husband, but this
factdid not shake tbe old lady's faith, as
is shown by her conveyance of her prop
erty to them.
Dr. Henry D. Wright, Thomas Downey,
Catherine E. Fuller and George L. Tilden
testified to tbe fact that Mrs. Robinson
has been feeble-minded for a long time.
Mr. Tilden said that when Mrs. Robin
son's husband died she complained to
him that she hadn't money enough to
bury him with, though she was at that
moment the possessor of thousands of
dollars' worth of property and in the re
ceipt of a constant cash income from the
rent of her building-. He knew this
property belonged to her, as it was her
own separate property, purchased with
money earned beiore her marriage, and
the title always stood in her name.
The defendants will be called on to-day
to give their side of the case and to ex
plain how they got tho deeds to the prop
erty. ______________________________________________

ECHOES OF THE
COAST DEFENSE
Testing a Ten - Inch Gun
on a Disappearirg Car
riage. ,
The Manner in Which a Thirty-
Ton Piece of Ordnance Is
Loaded.
What It Costs to Fire the Variou.
Kind? of Guns That Are Now
Being Mounted For Uncle Sam.
The echoes of the big 10-inch rifled
gun, which has been recently mounted on
the bluff south of Fort Winfield Scott,
were heard for miles around yesterday
afternoon. .
This gun, which Is mounted on a disap
pearing carriage, is the first of its kind
ever mounted on this coast, and is the
lirst ever tested here. The test yesterday
was for powder and for the purpose of see
ms: how the machinery that causes the
"long black monster" to drop down below
the level of the pit on which it is mounted
would work.
The first test was noted by Colonel W.
R. Shatter, Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel B.
If. Young, a large number of officers from
tho Presidio and quite a number of citi
zens.
The gun, which weighs 67.110 pounds,
or uearly thirty tons, is on an immense re
volving carriage to permit the training of
the piece in any direction. On this car
riage are two very heavy levers, on which
the gun rests. When they are elevated
the piece is above the upper edge of the
pit, and when a shot is fired the recoil
forces these down and brings the breech
of the gun to the level of the loading plat
form. As the gun descends four steel 'â 
clamps drop against Tachets and hold the
gun to the level at which it dropped until
they are released, and then a counter
weight heavier than the gun sinks and
brings the rifle to the firing position. The
machinery works with the exactness of
c.'ockworlc and is a marvel of mechanical
ingenuity.
The projectiles used are long and coni
cal-shaped, and weigh 5G2 pounds; the
charges of powder used yesterday varied
from 162 to 280 pounds. The gun can, by
an auxiliary device, be dropped by
manual force. This was done yesterday for
the first charges.
The loading of a big gun is an interest
ing process. Two ol the gunners roll the
projectile to a point almost under the gun
which has the oreech block open; there it
is rolled into an iron scoop. This is taken
up by block and tackle attached to a
running crane, and by means of a crank
roller the projectile is raised to the level
of the opening in the breech, carefully
pushed into it ana then rammed home by
eight gunners using a very long rammer.
The first test yesterday was with 162
pounds of powder. There was a loud
report, a great volume of smoke, and more
than a mile away the spray climbed high
in the air to show where the shot had
struck the water.
In the meantime, the big gun by the
force of the recoil, dropped, but the
clutches not working with the precision
expected, the gun returned to its high
position.
The next test was with 250 pounds of
powder, and that was more satisfactory,
although the gun had to be lowered by
band.
The third was with 280 pounds ol pow
der, and. the recoil being greater, the
mechanism worked better, but the success
of the disappearing apparatus will not be
determined until further tests are made.
The cost of tiring big guns is no small
item, as appears from the following from
a report from the oflice of the Secretary of
War: "It costs for powder and projectiles
alone: To tire one round from the eight
inch B. L. rifle. $164 55; ten-inch B. L.
rifle, $322 40; twelve-inch B. L. rifle,
$561 70; twelve-inch B. L. mortar. $219 65;
eight-inch pneumatic gun, $280; fifteen
inch pneumatic gun, $650."
According to these figures the tests yes
terday cost the Government $967 20.

BUTLER'S COUNSEL QUESTION
THE COURT'S JURISDICTION
Second Day of the Extradition Proceedings Involving
the Australian Suspect Before Commis
sioner Heacock. .
TECHNICAL POINTS ARE
OVERRULED.
The Alleged Murderer Sat Stol
idly Indifferent Through
cut the Day.
C3NTIKUANCE OF TH?, CASE TO
TO-MORROW.
Ccnsu'-G.neral Warburlon, Sergesnt
Banner a .d Captain McAllister
Called to Testify
The alleged murderer, Butler, or Ashe,
as he is now generally termed, again ap
peared before Commissioner Heacock, sit
ting in the United States Circuit Court,
yesterday morning at 10:30 o'clock, when
the hearing of the warrant and pica
tion for the extradition of the prisoner
was resumed. The principal witnesses ex
amined yesterday morning and afternoon
were Sergeant Bunner, the British Consul-
General, J. W. Warburton, and Captain
McAllister of the ship Langdale, whose
testimony edited much cf interest to the
sum of information which has already ob
tained publicity through the newspapers.
The attorneys for the defense presented
a demurrer, setting forth certain objec
tions to the jurisdiction of the court, in
reply to which Commissioner Heacock
read bis certificate of authorization in ex
tradition proceedings of this nature. At
the close of Captain McAllister's test)
mony yesterday afternoon an adjourn
ment was made by consent until 2 o'clock
on Wednesday.
Another litrge crowd assembled in the
corridors of the Appraiser's building some
time before the hour set for the continu
ance of the hearing, and many privileged
persons were admitted during the interval
to inspect the prisoner, as he smoked his
perennial cigar, in a room adjoining Mar
shal Baldwin's office. The prisoner had
been transferred thither in a hack from
the City Fri. on at 9 o'clock in the custody
of the Marshal and Deputy Gallagher.
For upward of an hour Ashe sustained
the scrutiny of the curious with perfect
equanimity, being further reassured, no
doubt, by the reflection that his personal
appearance was quite above reproach. He
wore his new store suit of navy blue and
cle/o negligee shirt, and had evidently
been recently snaved. On the whole, in
fact, his confinement and treatment seem
to have agreed with him.
The moment the door of the Marshal's
office was thrown open and the prisoner
appeared beiween Sergeant Bunner and
Deputy Marshal Gallagher, the crowd
stampeded in the direction of the court
room across the way, but on this occasion '
the rules were strictly enforced and no j
more were admitted than could be com- |
fortably accommodated in the space pro
vided for spectators. Several ladies occu- i
pied seats in the jury-box. and others of
the fairer sex were conspicuous in the :
foremost row of chairs behind the rail. In j
other respects the assemblage was of the I
nondescript order, though there was a ;
respectable sprinkling of professional j
gentlemen present. Captain Fraser of the !
ship Swanhilda was also an interested
witness of the proceedings throughout.
Meanwhile the attorneys on both sides, !
Messrs. Cormac & Donohoe for the ap
p;ication and .Messrs. Stone, Pidwell and
A. L. Black for the prisoner, took their
seat--; Consul-General Warburton eat next
to Mr. Cormac and the Australian detec
tive, Roche, immediately behind him. |
Constable Conroy was also In court,
tnough not again called upon to give evi
dence. McHat'.ie, however, was not pres
ent. The prisoner was provided with a
seat between the tables allotted to the
counsel and reporters, being guarded on
either hand by Sergeant Bunner and the
Deputy Marshal. He seemed outwardly
calm, though to the careful scrutinizer
that very assumption of indifference may
have appeared somewhat exaggerated.
His chin was supported by his right hand
and he gazed steadily in front of him for
the most part, paying no attention what
ever to the artists who were busily en
gaged in sketching his features.
The Commissioner having entered, At
torney Stone rose to notify him of the as- j
sociation in the defence of Attorneys !
Black and Learning. He went on to say i
that he and his colleagues wished the ]
court to afford them every possible ad- *
vantage, and to give the prisoner the
benefit of every doubt. Public opinion
was decidedly against the Iprisoner, and
this being a legal tribunal, he wished it to
bold the prisoner presumptively inno
cent, though the public presumption was
that he was guilty. Mr. Stone intimated
in conclusion that the defense would have
certain 'objections to introduce at an
early date.
The court observed that he understood 1
the case to be as any other in which the
Commissioner sat as a committing magis
trate. The first point to be considered by
him was as to whether any public offense
had been committed; secondly, was the
defendant guilty thereof, and it the court
found that a public offense had been com
mitted and that there was probable cause
to believe defendant guilty thereof, the
law would then hold him for extradition.
Attorney Cormac formally pointed out
that there were extradition proceedings
under the treaty of 1842 and a later one of
1889 between the Governments of the
United States and- Great Britain lor the
delivery of the defendant, whose aliases
he enumerated, accused of two murders
in the colony of New South Wales. The
particular offense the prosecution was
taking up now was the murder of Captain
Dee Weller on October 31, 1890. The pro
ceedings were based upon Consul-General
Warburton's complaint, duly filed at this
port, which, with the court's permission
be would read. *
The court confessed himself willing to
waive the ceremony, while the defense
observed that they were already familiar
with it. In the absence of any definite
objection, however, Attorney v (iormac
proceeded to read the document in ques
tion, which has already appeared in these
columns. He also read the Marshal's re
turn on the warrant with the consent of
the court.
Attorney Stoneâlt is expedient at this
juncture, in defense of the prisoner, to
ffer certain objections to the character oi
ibis court. They are in the following
form: ,
In the matter of the application for the extra
ction of Frank Uar-vood, otherwise called
5. Burgess, otherwise called Butler, otherwise
.ailed Sampson, otherwise called Clare, other
wise called Lee Weller, under the treaty be
tween the United Kates and Great Britain,
concluded August 9. 1842: â  â *,_.
Comes now the prisoner by his attorneys,
Leonard Stone, John T. I', dwell and Black &
-teaming, and objects and demurs to further
.
proceedings in this behalf upon the following
grounds:
Firstâ That the jurisdiction of this tribunal
has not been properly invoked.
Secondâ That this tribunal has no jurisdic
tion over tbe person of the prisoner.
Thirdâ this tribunal has no jurisdiction
over the subject matter of this proceeding.
Fourth â at the complaint dres not state
facts sufficient to constitute an extradictable
offense under any treaty between Great Brit
ain and the United states and especially under
the treaty now in force.
Fifthâ That the prisoner is deprived of his
liberty without due process of law, contrary
to and in violation of the provisions of the
fifth aud fourteenth amendments to the con
stitution of the United States.
Sixthâ That the proceeding herein is unau
thorized and contrary to the terms of the
treaty relations between Great Britain and
the United States as set forth in the treaty
now in force under date of July 15, 1889.
As the above objections, he continued,
were such as might be raised at any stage
of the proceedings they did not care to
enter further into the matter at the mo
ment. It might, however, assist in estab
lishing the relevancy of evidence which
they proposed to produce.
The court, replying to the objection as
to jurisdiction and authority, said that a
stciion of the Federal procedure provided
for a case of th* present nature and em
powered the Commissioner to make an
order to subpena witnesses at the expense
of the Government. He also real his
specific authority granted by Judge Mor
row, January 5. 1897, in the District
Court, under which he was now hearing
evidence a-- to criminality, etc.
After some further technical discussion
on the part of counsel relative to these ob
jections Attorney Stone said that the de
j fense might present the same with addi-
I tional force as the case developed, where
j upon Attorney Cormac called Serjeant
Bunner to the stand.
Mr. Block desired to have it entered on
the record that the taking of evidence
was incompetent, specifically on the
ground that the complaint set forth no
extraditable offense under the treaty of
1842, as modified by the convention of
Â»'*. He contended that the complaint
â  contained no sufficiently accurate charge
to make the offense one under common
j law, according to the terms of which the
court must proceed.
Tho court Objection overruled.
Mr. Stone â Exception taken.
| The witness then deposed as follows:
He was a sergeant of police and a D.-puty
Marshal and resided in the City and
County of San Francisco. He had a writ
ten permission irom the Marshal. (Pro
duced, examined and read.) He was in
the police station at the loot of Tavlor
street at 4 o'clock on the morning of Feb
ruary 2, 1897, when he had in his posses
sion a warrant. Con ole Conrov called
him about 4:30 or 5 o'clock, telling him
that tho Swanhilda was outside. He then
cot up, and accompanied by Detectives
Siivey, Roche and McHaitie went down
along the wharf. " Tney staved there fif
teen or twenty minutes listening for sig
nals, but received none from the towboat.
After a while Officers Ferguson and Con
roy called his attention to a flash of light
wuereupon they went aboard the revenue
cutter Hartley and proceeded down the
bay until off the Presidio. Here they ran
alongside the Swanhilda and Detectives
Siivey, Egan. Ferguson and himself went
aboard.
Tue witness then found the captain and
asked if he had a man named Lee Weller
aboard. Tne captain .-aid he had and
witness asked if he was in irons. The
captain replied that he was not. After
some talk all hands were mustered by the
United States quarantine officer, the cap
tain telling witness that he would point
Lee Weller out to them. This he did, and
Detectives Egan and Fergmon immedi
ately seized him, and the witness put hi
pistol under his nose and told him to
throw up his bands. Prisoner was then
ironed and witness took him down the
after hatch. The prisoner wanted to know
what all the fuss was about.
The witness called Conroy aboard and
showed him Lee Weller for purposes of
identification. In the presence of the so
called Lee Weller Conroy said: "This is
the man." The witness asked Weller if
he knew Conroy and he said he did not.
Conroy was disguised at the time with a
large beard and mustache.
The witness tola him to take them off
and then Lee Weller acknowledged hav
ing seen him. The prisoner was then
taken into the cabin, where the witness
read the United States warrant. This
done the witness took the prisoner's
picture (produced) and asked him if that
was his picture and name. He sad it was.
Prisoner's effects were then gathered to
gether.
Mr. Cormecâ You produced that pho
tograph ?
Witnessâ l did, and I showed it to the
prisoner and he said it was hi** picture. I
asked at first if it was his picture and
name and he said "That's me. "
"What name? '
"Harwood was on the picture." Con
tinuing, the witness said that Officers Fer
guson, Egan. the captain, Marsnal Bald
win and himself were present when he
read the warrant. After the warrant had
been read the prisoner said: "Don't
search rae here, let me go ashore."
Mr. Blackâ said thai?
The witnessâ Lee Weller.
: Mr. Cormac â He made no reply to the
charge? SFtP
"No, sir." Witness then stated that the
prisoner was put aboard the Hartley and
taken to the police station.
Mr. Black moved to have that portion
of the evidence referring to what the cap
tain had said when he pointe 1 out lne
man known as Lee Weiier stricken out.
The court overruled the objection, and
the witness went on to say that the patrol
wagon was sent lor and the prisoner con
veyed to the City Hall. All his baggage
was searched in the detectives' room in
tbe prisoner's presence and an inventory
made. At the time of the arrest the ves
sel was between the heads and the bay and
within the jurisdiction of the District
Court. They found lots of stuff marked
"Lee Weller."
Marshal Baldwin here produced a "bulky
sack containing the prisoner's effects,
which the witness proceeded to examine.
Mr. Cormac remarked that one of th?
sections of the convention of 1889 staled
that all property should be sent back with
the prisoner. ' -
Mr. Stone contended that the original
requisition must designate the articles re
quired in thÂ« country where the trial was
to take place.
Mr. Cormac quoted the provision, and
the examination was resumed. The wit
ness, referring to the list indicated by
Mr. Cormack, said it was the one made at
the time and indorsed by the prisoner.
Mr. Cormac began to enumerate each
article, a list of which has already been
published, but hed scarcely specified tie
"Songs of England." volume one. ad
dressed to Mr-. Lee Weller and dated
September, 1894. when Mr. Black again
rose to interpolate a question which was
in effect: "Was the writing on the book
when in possession of the prisoner?"
Witnessâ lt was, sir. , Every article is
in the same condition as when taken.
One of the rare laughs evoked at any
stage of the hearing arose when Attorney
Cormack asked: "Do yon find there a
sheet of music with the song, 'We All
Love Jack'?
Witne. -_ We All Love Jack"; yes sir.
The enumeration of the numerous ar
ticles comprised in the inventory contin

charges and recommendations found

Heacock, Identified the Numerous Articles Found Among Butler's Baggage on Board the Swanhilda.
among the prisoner's effects. Mr. Black
a_.ked at thai juncture that these docu
ments mtcht be read subject to their re
jection by the court should it subse
quently transpire that they had been in
any way altered.
"Do you find there," asked Attorney
Cormac, "the picture of a lady in a
frame?"
'Yes, sir." '
"Did the prisoner make any statement
concerning that to you?"
"The prisoner told me that this was his
wife."
The above reply referred to the picture
of Mrs. Lee \Veller.
Mr. Black sharply demanded: "Where
did tie prisoner tell you that?"
"At the City Hall."
"When?"
"W. en we were examining his goods."
Attorney Cormac resumed his direct
examination, continuing to enumerate
articles mentioned in the inventory. The
witness explained in reference to one or
two documents that a mark hud been
placed upon the same in order to identify
them. Mr. Black asked in reference to a
certiticfte of character granted to JL_e_.
Weller in 1888 by the captain of the Alma
dine, whether he was familiar wilh the
handwriting of the defendant.
Witness â Yes, sir.
"In whose handwriting is that paper
just read?"
"I don't know."
"Is it in this man's handwriting?"
"It is not."
Mr. Black here approached the prisoner
and asked him to write a few words on
a piece of paper. He made no immediate
use of this, however.
In due course the package of strychnine
found in the sweat-band of the prisoner's
hat was unearthed. "After we had taken
him to the City Pri.on," said Bunner,
"we Stripped him as.d in the sweat-band
of his hat Detective Euan found* this pack
age. I was present when it was found."
He added in reply to a question put by
Attorney Pidwe.l that lie was not per

ing of the inventory continued and the
court ra-e wuen it was finally completed,
until 2 o'clock.
On resuming Consul-General J. W.
Warburton w..s called to the stand. After
having given his ful! name, residence and
occupation, he stated in reply to Attorney
Cormac's interrogatories: "I am the
person who made ann verified this com
plaint. 1 did so in my offiial capacity. I
am intimately acquainted with Sir Julian
Pauncefote, who is Embassador Extraordi
nary and Plenipotentiary for Great Brit
ain. , I served many years in the London
Foreign Office aud am familiar with his
signature."
"In the regular course of your business
did you receive instructions from Sir
Julian Pauncefote, concerning this mat
ter?"
"I did. In the shape of a signed com
munication and telegrams."
These were read and were designed to
notify the Consul-General of the Butler
murders, which were spoken of as having
been committed under circumstances of
"terrible atrocity," and to inform him of
the fugitive's escape from justice in the
ship Swanhilda. and of the Embassador's
application to the Government at Wash
ington for bis extradition, in accordance
wuh met ions received from her
Majesty s^ Government. The teleerams
were dated respectively December 11 and
D cem ber 17, 1898, the latter being merely
confirmatory of the former
-iV_?Â°.i yOU _- kn ? w '--_? your connection

"Certainly."

Any 7 Â« *
"I have. They were -both. duplicates
T one set of which was sent to Washington."
Mr. Blackâ lt is wholly immaterial as
|to how he received his information. If
i he as a matter of fact acted upon what he
j believed to be correct information that is
ali that is necessary. We contend that
j the telegram is not direct evidence; it is
merely hearsay. It is of no benefit to this
case and this being so could not tend to
establish the euilt of this defendant. Be
sides the witness needed no such tele
gram to make his complaint,
Mr. Cormac â If you admit that he had
authority to make such complaint without
them we* will not put them in.
The court â You admit that he is Consul-
General.
Mr. Black (peremptorily)â No. sir.
The court â I overrule the objection.
Mr. Cormac â It is not admitted, I un
derstand, that he is Consul-General. I
therefore desire him to produce his com
mission from her Majesty and his United
Stales papers.
The witness immediately did so and the
defense, upon examination of these docu
ments, declared itself satisfied.
Mr. Cormacâ That is all, your Honor.
The defense here called Sergeant Bunner
for cross-examination.
Mr. Blackâ l understood you to say thai
you had a warrant handed to you on the
morning of February 2 at about 4 o'clock.
"1 said no snch thing, sir. I said I had
a warrant in my possession."
"When eras that warrant issued?"
"Sometime in January. I don't exactly
remember the date."
"Can you tell by examining it?"
"Yes. But this is not the warrant I
had. There was another issued before,
this "
"Where did you get that warrant?"
"It was served afterward by me in Cap
tain Lees' .the?. The warrant under which
I toot th 9 prisoner was issued in Jan
uary."
'Where was the prisoner at that time?"
"I suppose he was at sea."
"Was he within the jurisdiction of this
court?"
"No, sir."
"And that is the warrant you took him
on?"
"Yes, sir. I found him on the British
ship hwanhilda."
"Where is she registered?"
"1 don't know."
"It is a British ship?"
"It* flies a British flag."
"Where did you see her first?"
"About the middle ground buoy."
''How far at sen ?"
"In the bay of San Franci co."
"When did you first see the Swanhilda?"
"Some two or three years ago," replied
the witness, amid laughter.
"1 refer to this occasion."
"I boarded her between 5:30 and 6
o'clock."
"Was she anchored?*'
"She was not. She was towing."
wasn't tied to any wharf?"
"Oh, no; she could not be when she was
to wine."
"She wasn't conneted with any wharf?"
"How could she be?"
Task you as a matter of fact."
"No, certainly not."
"When you went aboard had you any
other paper in the nature of a warrant
other than the warrant you refer to as
issued in January?"
"I had only that one warrant."
"Who was the first man to whom you
spoke?"
"Captain Miller, the pilot, and then
Captain Fraser. I asked Fraser if he had
the man aboard his ship."
"Where was the prisoner?"
\ "I suppose he was knocking about the
main deck."
"Where was he when you first saw
him?" â
"On the starboard side of the ship, near
the cabin door."
"This is the man here?" .
"Yes, sir."
"What did. yon say to him?"
" 'Throw your hands up P, " "'
"He did so?" '. --â ;â 
--"X guess so," responded Banner, non
-1 chaiantly, and tha crowd tittered,
"_"> id you handcuff him?
"No; Egan and Ferguson did so under
my directions. I acted by order of the
Chief of Police."
"Did you call them to your assistance as
Marshal?"
"No; as a police officer. I went there
as a police officer and a United States
Marshal both."
"Now, sergeant, you referred to a sec
ond warrant. When did you get that?"
"I told you it was served on him in
Lees' office tha same day. It was handed
to me about 9 or 10 o'clock."
"When was it issued?"
"I don't know."
â¢â¢was it issued before the Swanhilda
came into the beads?"
"I think it was issued alter the arrest."
Mr. Cormac â Objection!
Mr. Blackâ As I understand it, the
Consul will make application later, by
which he will sesk to have certain articles
referred to here taken away with the pris
oner. I desire to know from the witness
by what authority, how, when and where
these articles were taken. It seems to me
a proper course of cross-examination.
The court held that it was immaterial
how they came there. As he understood
it, these effects were found among the
prisoner's luggage after his arrest in the
bay of San Francisco, and therefore with
in the court's jurisdiction.
Mr. Black "I wanted to find out when
that was done." He added that it was
necessary at the time of the issuance of
the warrant for certain facts to exist. The
first being the commission of a crime; the
second the tact that the crime was extra
ditable, and third that at the time the
person accused was within the court's jur
! isdiction. His point in this examination
', was. therefore, obvious.
The court suggested that the words
i "seeking asylum or found," contained in
I the treaty, might be given a broad inter
; pretation. Certainly if the prisoner was
i arrested in the waters of the bay he was
i within the jurisdiction of the judicial au
thorities of this district. Furthermore, he
could himself state from his own knowl
edge that the complaint was made Febru
ary 2, and the warrant issued abont a day
later. Under the State Jaw it was ex
pressly provided that when a person was
brought before a magistrate, either with
or without a warrant, the magistrate
should see whether an offense had been
com ted.
* Mr. Black took exception and then re
sumed cross-examination.
"Where," he asked, "did you find these
various articles first?
"On board the Swanhilda. I was stand
ing by the main hatch when they were
brought to me. They were not on the
person of the prisoner, but he said they
were his. As far as I know they were in
his possession."
"Who took them out of his possession?"
"Detective Siivey."
"In whose possession ars they now?"
"In the hands of the United States Mar
shal, Barry .Baldwin."
"You had no paper or writ authorizing
you to take possession of any of those
goods?"
"Nothing further than ihe order of the
Chi. ol Police and the Marshal."
"Had tuey any written order from any
body?"
"I don't know. I obeyed their orders.
I goi my orders from the Chief of Police
of this City and delivered them to Mr.
Moran, the property clerk of the Police
Department, and afterward to the Mar
shal."
"Do yon know whether they have been
in anybody else's possession?"
The witness explained that the Consul-
General examined them, but that they
were in his (Bunner's) possession ail the
time. They were in the same condition as
when he received tbem.
"To my knowledge," said Mr. Black,
"there was one paper which had initials
on it."
"I told you myself that they were there.
And there was this pistol, which has no
number. He acknowledged it was his, and
to identify it we placed the initials J. R.
upon it."
The prisoner Ashe here denied in a
scarcely audible voice that he had ac
knowledged that the pistol was bis.
"J. R.," continued the witness, "stands
for John Roche. With the exception of
two changes, the articles are in the same
condition a.i when taken. They were in
the forecastle, and he acknowledged they
were his property."
"Who carried them away?"
"All hands."
"Yon had no regular process?"
"My authority as a police officer. I
should arrest him on the charge of mur
der and lock him up on that charge."
"That is all."
"When you took possession of this
property," said Mr. Cormack,"did you do
so yourself?" ;'_,,,
â¢ "Yes, sir; it never left my possession.
I gave it to Mr. Moran ior safe keeping,
but I kept control of it. The Consul-
General did not take possession of it and
refused to do so. I returned it to the
Marshal and he and McHattie brought it
over to this building. The Consul put his
seal on it." BBHRSBttfI
Mr. Blackâ witness says he took
possession under authority both from the
Chief of Police and the Marshal. What
was the Consul's seal put on it tor?
â¢ ! It was intended to give it to the Con
sul, but after consultation with Judge
Morrow he ordered it to be returned to
this building."
"Are the articles here the same yon
took from him
"There are more here than were speci
fied this morning. There is one article
missing and that is a prayer-book. , Some
one took it, I guess." _ *.>*_/: ...
"Prayer-book gone?"'
"Prayer-book gone." [Laughter.]
Captain John McAllister of the British
ship Langdale was the last witness called.
"My ship," he said, "has been here
about six weeks. My residence is in Liver
pool, England. I was acquainted with
Captain Lee Weller, wbom I met first in
Sydney, N. S. W., and afterward in New
castle. I knew him for three or four
months."
Being asked to describe Captain Lee
"Weller the witness continued: "He was
either 37 or 38 years of age and bis hair
was black and curly. He wore a black
beard, but I do not know the color of his
eyes. He was a little taller than I am, or
about 5 feet 6% inches. I don't know
i where he was born of my own knowledge."
"Do you see him in court?" asked Mr.
Cormac.
"No, sir."
"You see the prisoner in court?"
"Yes, sir."
"Is that Captain L. W. Weller?"
"No, sir," replied the witness emphati
cally. "No more like him than you are."
Mr. Black The man you refer to was
named â ?
"Lee Weller."
"I understood you to swear he was Lee
Wellington Weller."
"He had both names."
"You don't &now whether it was LeeM.
or Lee W. ?"
"1 never saw his signature."
"Would you swear he was not as young
as 30?"
"I would."
"If there be a man named Lee W. Weller
who is but 30 years of age he would not be
the man you knew?"
"No, sir."
"You say you knew this man?"
"I have seen the Lee Weller I knew
about twenty times at least. He was
never on my ship. He was a passenger
on board a ship called the Southesk. His
wife died on board while we were in New
castle. I saw him several times both there
and in Sydney. The first time I saw him
for ten minutes only, and I saw him again
in Newcastle about a fortnight later, per
haps. I was with him about a quarter of
an hour each time I saw him af tor that.
These interviews were separated by inter
j vals of two, four or five days. I never had
j any particular business with him, but met
him as I would meet any friend. Ido not
know whether his name was Lee W. or
Lee M. Weller."
Here Mr. Black requested the prisoner
to stand up. which he did.
"Now," said the attorney, turning to
the witness, "tell the court in what way
this man differs from the man you refer
to."
"The man l knew had darx, curly hair
and black whiskers and was not so tall as
this man. I should say that the prisoner
is 5 feet 8% inches in height."
"What were the habits of the man you
refer to?" [Objection.]
"Do you know this man's name?"
"No, sir. Bui I will swear he is not Lee
Weiier." .
"Do you mean you will swear he is not
the man you knew as Lee Weller?"
"Yes, sir."
"But not that he is not named Lee
Weller?"
"No, sir."
"When you knew Lee Weller in Syd
ney," said Mr. Cormac, "he resided" at
Manly Beach?"
"Yes, sir. I never saw his wife."
"What year was this?"
"Eighteen ninety-six."
"What ship was "he on at that time?"
"The Southesk. His wife died on
board."
Mr. Blackâ Did you see him as late as
October?
"No, sir; I was nearly here then. I left
about the 23d of September."
"How late did you see him ?"
"About a month or two before. I can
not swear to it."
Mr. Blackâ We move to strike out the
evidence us wholly immaterial and irrele
vant.
The court overruled the motion.
An adjournment was here taken until
Wednesday next at 2 o'clock, by consent.
Counsel on both sides will in the mean
time arrive at some arrangement whereby j
counsel for the defense may be permitted j
to examine the prisoner's effects in order
to satisfy themselves that these are ac- j
tually in the same condition as when first
confiscated. Commissioner Heacock left
the matter entirely in the hands of Mar
shal Baldwin.
The courtroom was cleared and the
prisoner conveyed to his cell in the City
Prison.
BUTLER IN CANADA.
If Not a Mounted Policeman He
Was Familiar With the Regina
Barracks.
â¢ If Butler was not a member of the Cana
dian Northwest mounted police he is fa
miliar with the barracks at Regina and
the people who were stationed there at
the time of the Riel rebellion.
Last night Alexander J. Smith, an ex
member or the force, now living at 807
Kearny street, called upon Captain Lees
and said he knew a man named Ashe who
was a member of Troop B, stationed at
Regina.
Detective Wren was sent to the prison
with Smith, so that be could have an un
interrupted talk with Butler in hi. cell.
Smith looked at Butler for a moment or
two and then spoke to him, telling him he
was a member of Troop B. After hearing
Butler talk Smith came to the conclusion
tnat he had never to his knowledge seen
him before.
Butler talked with Smith about the
police at Regina and was familiar with
the officers and men. He mentioned the
names of several, among them Commis
sioner Irvine, Captain Deane and Homer,
the head saddler. Butler seemed to have
even a better memory than Smith as to
some of the doings at the barracks, and
knew everything that went on there.
After Smith had finished his conversa
tion with Butler Smith said: "'Tnat man
isn't Ashe, out I am satisfied he has been
a member of the police. It was after the
rebellion that I joined and he might have
been there at that time."
Smith returned to Captain Lees and re
ported that he failed to recognize Butler
although he s* emed to be quite familiar
with the Regina barracks.
_ When Butler denied to Captain Lees on
Sunday that he had made a statement to
a Call reporter that he was a member of
the mounted police during the Riel rebel
lion the captain reminded him that he
had a few days before made the same
statement to him, which he had appar
ently forgotten. Butler winced, and
binned out that he was only in jest when
he made the statement.
Captain Lees is determined to find out
what Butler did while in the Canadian
northwest, and he will communicate wih
different authorities there on the subject
The captain is inclined to thins that
Butler, if not a mounted policeman was
connected with the Regina barracks in
some way during the rebellion.
Prisoners sentenced to Stony Mountain
penitentiary were often sent to Regina
barracks to do "escort duty," and the cap
tain thinks that Butler may. have been
one of these prisoners, which enabled him
to get such accurate information about the
officers and men stationed at the barracks.
- There is a possibility, if this is correct,
that Butler knew Ashe, the policeman,
perhaps intimately, and had assumed his
name after regaining his liberty.
BUTLER IN ALASKA.
An Ohloan Thinks He Knew Him
There as a Desperate Mis
sourlan.
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, Feb. B.â Esta S.
Smith of Tippecanoe City, fifteen miles
west of here, was employed by the Gov
ernment at Afognak, Alaska, during the
years 1892 and 1893. He declares that he
recognizes the picture and description of
the Au-*trali.n murderer Butler, which
appeared in the papers of last Wednesday,
as those of a man who slept in the same
room with him in Alaska. In a talk with
your correspondent to-day Mr. Smith
said :
"Butler when I knew him was always
J nervous and uneasy. He could not sleep.
â  He was a man who had plenty of money
; and spent it freely. Butler was a sailor,
| and claimed to have been born in Clay
; County, Missouri. During the war his
! parents moved to Nova Scotia. He was
j known along Pacific Coast as Captain
Peter Summit Butler, and was about 30
years old. rbecame very well acquainted
with him and consider him one of the
I most desperate men I ever met. He was
j a terror to the people, aud the landlord
! where we boarded endeavored to get But
! ler to leave as all were afraid of him. He
was afterward found at Sitka, Alaska,
where he was caught robbing a till.
"However, with the use of his ever
ready revolver, he managed to escape. In
a short time I again heard of him at Sitka,
where he robbed a commercial warehouse
of 7000 salted sealskins. He gagged the
agent and threatened to kill him and his
Indians if they should raise the alarm.
."Butler never could speak a good word
for the laws of his native country, always
I cursing when anything was said on that
subject."
Mr. Smith is positive that this is the
same man, and considers him the pirate
ofthe Pacific Coast.
Esta Smith is now a prominent lawyer
of Tippecanoe City.
THE BENSON CASES.
Indictments Will Probably Be Quashed
by the Court on Monday
Next.
It is expected that the charges against
John A. Benson and others, accused of
land frauds, will soon be dismissed.
Reddy, Campbell & Metson, attorneys for
the defendants, moved that the indict
ments be quashed in the Circuit Court
yesterday on the showing of a certificate
from the Surveyor-General that the de
tective surveys had been rectified and of
an agreement of counsel.
The United States attorneys were not
ready to have the matter dropped and
asked for a continuance until Monday
next, which was granted. It is expected
that at that time the motion to quash wilt
be granted.

half furlongs, the special feature of the
â  Card reopening day at the Emeryville
track was robbed of its luster. Estaca,
Rosebud, California and Sly were those
left to contest for the $1000 hung up, 01
â  which $700 went to the successful horse.
. California, with Sam Doggett up, opened
up lavorite at odds of 8 to 5, but stable
coin seemed to hang fire and the mare re
ceded to 13 to sin the ring. There was a
drizzling sort of play on Rosebud, but the
â¢ bulk of the bi>: money went in on Estaca.

The weather was clear and cool and the

heavy'.rom the recent rains and slow time
was tbe rule. The first four favorites sent
out were rocked to sleep in latest approved
racetrack fashion and then two short
priced choices scrambled home in the
lead.
After many vicissitudes Uasquil finally
took a race. McHale's colt was as good
as 4 to 1 in the betting on the opening
mile run, with a field of six starting, and
id a mild drive downed Draught less than
a 'length. The favorite, Don Ciarencio,
. finished third.
In the- five and a half furlong scramble,
.which was next decided, Palmerston,
against whom 15 to 1 was at one time ob

leading' throughout, won hands down

choice, Sugarfoot, over two lengths for the
* place.

Torsina, which coupled with Jay Wheeler
were held at twos in the betting, was a
fair third.
The speedy little Tea Rose came out in
the fifth race for the first time since her
sickness. It was a fire and a half furlong
, sprint, and Caspar ruled an even money
cnance around post time. Tea Rose
showed much of her old-time speed, but

HELD ON SUSPICION.
Three Young; Men Who "Were Trying
to Sell Jewelry Chased and
Captured.
A citizen reported to Lieutenant Bird
sail at the Central police station last night
that three young men had stopped him on
Larkin street and wanted him to buy some
jewelry which he believed had bean stolen.
The lieutenant detailed -Policemen
Riehl, Harrigan and Murphy to find the
three and bring them in. They came
across them on Larkin street and the
three fled. Harrigan had to fire two shots
in the air before the one he was chasing
surrendered, and Riehl had to chase bis
man three blocks before he was overtaken.
They were taken to the Central station
and searched. In their pockets were found
a gold ring with an emerald in the center
surrounded by ten small diamonds, a pair
of gold shirt studs, a silk . andkerchief
marked "T" and a Knight of Pythias
badge.
Tney could not give any satisfactory ex
planation of how they became possessed
or the articles, and they were locked up in
the "tanks" pending an investigation by
Detectives Egan and Siivey. They gave
the names of James Nesbit, G. H. James
worth and Joe Curley.
AN ABANDONED BABE.
Mrs. Cliff Found It ou Her Doorstep
and Has Got Tired of It.
Mrs. Cliff, 29.'6 Bush street, called at
the Receiving Hospital yesterday after
noon with a baby boy and it was later sent
to Mount St. Joseph Orphan Asylum.
Mrs. Cliff said that she found the baby
on her doorstep shortly before Christmas.
She took a fancy to it and thought the
would adopt it. The baby had since suf
fered from the measles and as it was con
stantly crying she had become tired of it.
She had no idea who the baby's parents
were or who had left it on her doorstep.

City Hall Improvement.
Chairman Rivers of the Street Lights Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors has done
good service in having arc lights placed in
the Larkin-street corridor of the City Hall.
They were lighted for the first time yesterday
and the improvement was commended gener
ally. Heretofore the corridor, especially dur
ing cloudy days, resembled a subterranean
cavern.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1897.
WILL CONSIDER
WATER RATES
Supervisors Vote to Begin
the Hearing To-
Morrow.
Spring Valley OificiaiS Were
. Invited to Be Present .
to Testify.
Resolution to Create a. Vacancy in
an Assistant Ci rkship of .h_
Board Postponed.
The Board of Supervisors will meet as a
committee of '.be whole next Wednesday
morning at 10 o'clock to consider the fix
ing of water rates for the fiscal year. This
was decided upon at a meeting of the Su
pervisors yesterday afternoon. At the
same time it was decided to invite tbe
president and secretary of the Spring
Valley Water Company to be present to
answer questions and, generally, to fur
nish the Supervisors with information.
This came about on motion of Supervisor
Clinton, chairman of the Committee on
Water and Water Supply.
The committee submitted a long report,
and incidentally recommended tbat Cle
ment Bennett be elected the official
stenographer. Supervisor Rivers, who
constituted the minority of the commit
tee, moved tbat J. A. Holland be elected
as the stenographer, and this motion pre
vailed.
Tbe Water Committee in its report re
counted what was done at its meeting last
week. The proceedings hay. previously
been published. The committee averred
that the annual report of the Spring Val
ley Water Company is vague and indefi
nite. A part of the report was as follows:
The City and County is called upon to allow
fair and reasonable water rates to be paid by
tiie City and County and its inhabitants, and
cettalniylt should be informed, clearly and
convincingly, oi the details of the expendi
tures of the company in order to act as fair
and just arbitrators between the company and
its customers, The company owes it to Itself
and to Its customers to make such a statement
in detail of all its operations, and especially of
i'.s expenditures, in order to demonstrate its
business policy and jus if the board in the
establishment of water rates as tbe board may
deem just, that are warranted by the condi
tions and requirements of their water supply.
Your committee feel that unjust criticism of
the action of the board should be avoided iv
the matter of fixing rates, and until Iniorma
tion is obtained more definite than presented
nothing can be done to accomplish the ob
jects 01 the inquiry.
A recommendation was also made by
the committee that meters be attached to
the Denman School, Horace Mann Gram
mar School, Whittier Primary School and
placed at Alta plaza, that the ac.ual
amount of water used at these places
might be determined. The report was
adopted, and the accompanying reso-u
--tion concerning the water meters was
acted upon favorably.
Supervisor C-inton read a letter, in
which Charles Webb Howard, president
of tbe Spring Valley Water Company, ex
pressed willingness to furnish the board
with all information desired.
A little flurry occurred over a resolution
reported by the Judiciary Committee to
expunge Gibson street, between Hyde and
Larkin, Green and Union, from the official
map. Mayor Phelan asked whether the
Judiciary Committee had advised with the
City and County Attorney about this mat
ter, and expressed the opinion that the
City ought to be represented when such
action was proposed.
Supervisor Smith, chairman of the Ju
diciary Committee, answered that the City
and County Attorney had not been con
sulted. Only property-owners had testi
fied. The board adopted the resolution
to expunge Gibson street from the official
map.
A resolution was adopted permitting
-supervisors Lachmau and Clinton to ex
change places on the Judiciary and Sireet
Light committees.
A resolution to remove Charles E. Par
ent from bis ution as assistant clerk to
the board caused som discussion. Su
pervisor Clinton objected to meddling
with the clerks in the office of the board.
Supervisor Dodge also spoke against the
removal of Parent. The resolution pro
vided also for the appointment of J. J.
Lynch to take his place. Chief Clerk Rus
sell was invited to say something about
changes in the office, and be said the last
board made no changes, and he thought
that the preceding board left the clerks
undisturbed. Supervisor Dodge said that
the majority ought to have its appetite
satisfied. It already gives signs 01 indi
gestion. A motion to postpone for two
weeks was lost. Supervisor Delanv moved
for postponement for one week, and it was
so voted. j.f
Supervisor Sljpehan moved that tbe
office of janitor in the office of the Super
intendent of Streets be declared vacant.
M. Flaherty fills the position. It was
proposed that H. M. Loresen should suc
ceed him. The resolution passed, but
Supervisor Sheehan subsequently said
that be had been mistaken and he was
permitted to withdraw the resolution.
The Judiciary Committee reported in
fevor of refunding money paid on dupli
cate assessments to H. Ickelbeimer, John
Nicholson, Mary T. Prince, D. Bargagli
ottiand G. Camicia. The com mi tee also
reported adversely on the petition of .Her
man de Laguna for the repeal of order
3035, granting a franchise to the People's
Mutual Telephone Company; also upon
the petition of Adolph Sutro to eliminate
from the map portions of Fifth and Sixth
avenues south from J__ street.
The Committee on Finance recom
mended that the salary of Daniel E. Con
don as superintendent of construction of
the Hall of Jus ice be not paid until the
work of construction is nctually com
menced. The report was adopted.
Supervisor Britt filed his renort of the
progress of legislation upon bills in which
San Francisco is concerned.
Proposals to supply a laundry plant for
the Almshouse were received and referred
to the Hospital Committee, tbe bids being
as follows: Troy Laundry and Machine
Company, $3125; P. F. Dundon, $3667;
Joshua Handy Machine Work., $4100; P.
J. Monahan, $1650.

Hamburg Desires to Study

Official Invitation to Exhibit
Stow Lake and Other
Attractions.
At the Forthcoming Fair There WiU
Be a Comparison of the World's
Breathing-Places.
The purpose of inviting San Francisco
to take part in the general horticultural
exhibition at Hamburg, Germany, during
the present year becomes clear in view of
the statement that "in oriter to bring out
and give a clear idea of its h rticuttural
character it is proposed to exhibit plans,
models, etc., of the most noted State and
city parks, public gardens, promenades,
greeneries and pleasure grounds.''
Tnis statement is included in the official
invitation which has been received by the
Board of Supervisors. It is practically an
invitation to exhibit a model or map of
Golden Gate Park as illustrative of the
beauties of San Francisco. "For the
above mentioned objects," so the invita
tion reads, "it is the intention to erect a
distinct and spec pavilion, for which a
place is prospectively reserved. The plac
ing of objects for exhibition in this pavilion
is to be done uniquely, at the committee's
own cost, who wiil also attend to keeping
clean and guarding the exhibits free of
expense."
Andreas Mayer, chief engineer of the
city of Hamburg, writes: "As a member
of the committee, as well as of the di
rectory of the technical sub-committee. 1
have taken it upon myself to invite the ad
ministration of larpe cities who have spe
cially valuable public parks, gardens,
lawns and pleasure grounds under their
control and management, to participate
in this proposed collective exhibition. I
devote myself to this und rtaking with
special zeal for the rea-on that in my offi
cial position I have charge < f the large
public parks and gardens of this munici
pality, and am convinced of the great im
portance of jointly bringing out this exhi
bition and through it a possible exchange
of views and comparisons of the eff ct of
different local and climatic conditions on
the horticultural management of public
parks and gardens in the larger cities."
The suggestion is also thrown out that
Go.den Gate Park may be represented by
a large model or map. The exhibition
will be held in the heart of the city of
Hamburg, in a handsomely improved
par., embracing an area of fifty-live acres.
The buildings will be around the sides of
the park, In one of the buildings will be
a rosarium, a rose exhibition taking up
alone a space equivalent to the area of a
whole _iiy block, according to the scale of
measurements laid down upon a map
which accompanied the official invitation,
lhe exhibit .on is in the hands of a com
mittee of which the Mayor of Hamburg is
the chairman. The invitation, which is
In German, has been translated by Dr.
Salfield for the convenience and consider
ation of the Board of Supervisors. The
expense attendant upon an exhibition of
the peculiarities of Golden Gate Park
would probably be confined to the cost of
making and shipping a large model.

POUND IN THE BAI.
The Waves Cast Up a Body. Supposed to
Be That of I) omen co Arbini.
The body of a man supposed to be that
of Domenico Arbini was picked up in the
bay off Goat Island by a boatman yester
day morning.
The body had evidently been in the
water for some time, as the features were
unrecognizable. Papers in the pockets of
clothes, which appeared to be those of
an Italian fisherman, showed that he bad
sent considerable sums of money to Italy
during the past few years.
An envelope addressed to Domenico
Arbini containing a letter signed "Muda
lena Arbini" was also found. The body
was placed in the Morgue and an inquest
held, the verdict of the jury being "Cause
unknown."

According to a dispatch which was re

Sharkey would fight Maher to a finish in
Carson on March 17. Danny Lynch, the
backer and manager of Sharkey, said last
evening that his protege is residing at
Vallejo and has heard nothing substantial
relative to a purse for a fight between
himself and Manerâ that is, so far as the ;
Nevada stake is concerned.
"I have in my pocket," said Lynch, "a
letter from the president of a New York
athletic club. The writer states that if
Sharkey will meet Maher in a contest of
ten rounds the club will hang uo a purse
of $7500. If everything goes well Sharkey
may accept this offer, but we intend to go

slow and sure. Now, so far as a finish
fight with Maher in Nevada is concerned,
we have heard nothing excepting news
paper talk. _
"I consider that Sharkey is as big a
drawing card as either Fitzsimmons or
Corbett, yet I am willing to match Tom
against Maher in a contest to a finish if
Stuart will hg__._> up a purse of $10,000; but
as there is only a limited time for either
Maher or Sharkey to train properly for a
finish fight, which must be pulled off in
Nevada on the 17th of March, I have
reason to believe that the men \gill not
meet in the Sagebrush State. v
"1 had a talk with Wheelock, who is
one of Stuart's managers, when he was in
this City, and I then gave him to under
stand that if Stuart was looking for a sec
mid attract]. and hai Maher and
Sbarkey in his mind's eye he must
Kut up $10,000 or there wouid not bea
ght.
'â¢Wheelock thought that the amount of
the purse I demanded was too much, but
when I aided him a telegram wi.ichl
had received from a prominent Eastern
sporting man concerning an offer made
by one of the big Eastern clubs for a ten
or fifteen round contest between Maher
ami Sharkey he soon changed bis mind,
and said that be would write to Stuart
and explain the situation. I have heard
nothing since from Wheelock or Stuart,
and I presume that their silence means
that there will not be a meeting between
Peter and Tom in Nevada. If a match
were made I would not hesitate a moment
to back Sharkey in any sum from $1000 to
$5000 a side, but Mr. Siler would not be
the referee.
"Corbett and Fitzsimmons selected
Siler by mutual consent. Dan Stuart
would have to select the referee if Maher
and Sharkey fought, and any man whom
Stuart would elect to referee the game
would be perfectly satisfactory to me."
Harry Corbett left this City yesterday
for Carson, where he will meet his brother
Jim. They are expected in this City on
Thursday. After Jim has had a few days
with his relatives he will leave for his
training station in the mountains.
Billy Delaney will be his principal
trainer. Very few bets have been made
in this City on the result, and it can be
safely said that the sporting people who
gamble on contests pugilistic will not
wager any large sums of money until they
have had an opportunity of "sizing up"
v the champion, who, according to latest
reports irom the East, is back to his old
form and feeling as frisky as a two year
old colt. But there are many of the sage
old boys who contend that if Corbett can
recuperate. as speedily as his friends iv the
East report he must be a really wonderful
man.
An old trainer of prize-fighters and one
who has witnessed many hard-fought
battles said last night that to his knowl
edge this will be the first time that two
prize-fighters concluded that four weeks
of training would be amply' sufficient to
place them in the best possible condition
to enter a ring and to contest to a finish
for a championship.
Fitzsimmons is evidently in good fettle
now, and if Corbett is in as good form as
his iriends say, lour weeks of careful train
ing should land him within the roped
square in a condition that will be satisfac
tory to his ( friends and the betting public.

NEW* YORK. N. V.. Feb. B.â Considering all
the developments during the day's session at the
Stock Exchange the markets for securities held
up remarkably well. The news and rumors were
well calculated to mark depression, but except in
the case ofthe industrial group the bears made
but little impression upon values. The first thing
that gave operators for a decline courage was tbe
receipt of lower quotations and of selling orders
from London. Then came the State Senate inves
tigation committee's inquiries into the affairs of
the sugar trust, which invited an attach upon

ing an alleged disruption 01 the Joint Traffic Asso

ever, was a cunningly devised statement that a
fl.-et had been ordered to Cuba to release A men
can prl-uone.s. The denial of this sensational re
port came so promptly irom Wasjlugton ihat the

their purpose of breaking the market, and in he
last hour they were running In lively fashion to

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. The changes in prices
of wheat this morning hinged on the changes in
stocks at the different points including in the visi
ble supply. The Immediate opening was rather
easy at a decline from Saturday, indifference at
Liverpool and large receipts in the Northwest, 511
cars, being the topics of interest untler discussion
and their digestion proving inimical to prices.
After the initial trading was over, however, atten
tion was turned to the posting or stocks. When
New York's decrease of 860,000 bushels was
posted an upward jump of a cent took place. The
final footings showed a total decrease of 1,708.000
bushels. The world's shipments tor last week
were estimated a: 5,600.000 bushels.
The amount on ocean passage was 60,000 bush
els. Receipt at Chicago were 13 cars and 79,
--013 bushels was taken from store. The Euglish
visible supply increased 1,463,000 bushels, the
announcement of which caused a slump ln prices
and converted a strong tone into a weak one. Ex
port clearances were liberal at 627,044 bushes.
Closing Continental cables were irregu ar. May
wheat opened from 76V^c to 765 B e, advanced to
76 % c, declined to and closed at 76V4Â©76%c.
s.'gÂ® Vic under Satur ay. Estimated receipts lor
to-morrow, 28 cars. No. 2 red. spot, wheat ranged
from 85VgC to 87% c, closing at 85V^@86V^c.
CORNâ Was very steady but prices gained lit
tle. That they did not depreciate was, however,
considered encouraging. 'Ihe strength in wheat
was naturally a help ln preserving the tone of
corn. Liverpool cables were quiet aud unchanged.
Receipts were 478 cars and 2226 buihels were
taken from store. The amount on ocean passage
decreased B J, O0 J bushels- The visible supply in
creased 1,394.000 bushels. Export clearances
were 728,000 bushels The break In wheat in the
last hour exerted a detrimental influence. May
corn opened at 24V4c, sold b tween 24V4@24!_j*c
and 23"f'' B Â©24c. closing at the inside, 3/ c unuer
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 640

OATSâ Were steady to firm, obtaining strength
from the neighboring speculative markets. Re
ceipts were 357 cars. There were no withdrawals
from store. The visible supp increased 152,000
bushels Exports were light at 20,558 bushels.
Prices weakened at the close on the general in
clination ot the other markets to decline. May
oats closed half a cent lower than Saturday. Es

CNION STOCKYARDS. Ili.. Feb. 8.- Atter
the advance last week of 16@25c per 100 pounds
for cattle resulting from large receipts no surprise
was created this morning when the run was posted
as 18,000 bead. This is a large supply for these
times. The demand was good, the beef-coolers be
ing empty, but buyers too* advantage of the in
creased supp y to for a decline of 10 cents In
beef steers, prime ones excepted. The quality of
stock showeo no Improvement. Country shippers
are sending fewer hogs to market, as many feed
ers are' unwilling to sell at present prices. Re
ceipts to-day were only 32,000 bead against 44,860
last Monday ai.d 30,545 a year ago. Packers and
shippers were active buyers, and tbev paid about
6 cents per 100 pounds more than at the close of
last wees, the supply being well taken. In sheep,
fortunately for seders, there was no more than a
good day's supply, the receipts b.'lng estimated at
16,000 head as compared wiih 21,898 last Monday
and 21,170 on the corresponding day a year ago.

WOOLâ Jacob Wollner's circular says: "The

with pr.ces about the same as last week. All kinds
of Wool have been selling and socks are getting
smaller. All the scourlng-mllli are sill actively
employed, consuming about 150,000 tbs per day.
Purchasing brokers still cannot get orders for
scoured Wool for Eastern account, as their corre
spondents do not want to pay higher prices than
they offered a month ago. The gales in he Ea-it
ern markets a c 1 bout 2,000,000 tbs less than last
wee.;, but since the Ist of January the sales show
an increase of 20 000,000 lbs more in comparison
with the same time In 1890. The market East ls
reported firm, but mostly speculative, and the mills
still cannot get many orders for goods. At the
London sales now la pro res. which will close the
loth inst., about one-third of the Wools offered are
bought for American account, especially of the
better Class of Wool, and this keeps the prices up
Ii It was not for the American purchasers tbere Is |
no doubt that the London market would be easier. 1
With heavy rains all over the State the outlook is
that we will have one of the best Wool crops lv
this late that we have had lor many years. Stock
sheep are advancing and a good many who went
out 01 the business are now buying, as a tariff on
Wool is nearly assured In about six weeks we
will have considerable new Wool in this mar
ket." We quote Fall Wool as follows: Free

MANY COSTUMES
How Salvationists Will
Show What They Do in
Many Countries.
The Great London International
â¢ Demonstration on a Small
Scale.
â¢Staff Captain Merry weather Out.in.s
a Missionary Exhibit on a
Large Plan.
Oakland Office San* Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 8. J*
A great demonstration is being prepared
by the Salvation Army to show the great
extent of its work in various countries. A
programme has been arranged, and ac
cording to its details all the members of
the army who can bo pressed into service
will take part in an international parade
and demon? on the ISth.
This object lesson of the army's work has
been presented in other large cities, but ia
.hew to Oakland. Nothing can more
clearly show the cosmopolitan nature of
/he work of Salvationists than such a
I nstration.
* There will be persons to represent in
costume the methods of the Salvationists i
in japan, China, Finland, Russia, Eng- ,
"Land, France, Germany, South Africa and '
many "other civilized and uncivilized cotta- !
.ties. Their costumes will be faithful
representations of those worn by their
iellow-oilicers in other land., and will
open the eyes of the public to the varied
.nature of Salvationist missionary work.
"We are making great preparations for
ihis affair," said Staff Captain Merry
weather to-day, "and we intend to show
the people of Oakland in a practical man- j
ncr just what we are doing. .Many people '
have the idea that our work is always j
pursued under the same pleasant condi- \
tions which they see in the United States,
but such is not the case. In other coun- i
tries our officers are imprisoned and I
c.toned aud frequently beaten and starved, j
and yet they never eive in. Each one J
who takes part in our demonstrations will (
represent our work in one country and
will tell some of the details, hardships
ana conquests that have been made there. '
"Our great international demonstration j
which took place in London some months |
' ago was the talk of the civilized world; j
not only were the different costumes rep- !
resented there, but also the domestic con- j
ditions under which the work is carried |
on. We cannot approach this compre
hensive scale in Oakland, but we can make
a good showing, and this is what we in
tend to do."
There are many well-known people in
the Oakland corps, and one of the most
prominent Salvationists on this side lhe j
bay is Millionaire Montgomery of Beulah, j
who has recently received an honorary j
commission of adjutant. Delegates will

PRAISE FOR ALAMEDA.
Chairman Forderer of the Board
of Trustees Speaks His
Mind.
Advocates Municipal Ownership and
a Tunnel Under the Estuary
Instead of Bridges.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. Joseph F.
borderer, chairman of the Board of
Trustees and Mayor by virtue of his office,
â published a long letter to-night, giving
his; views upon the people of this city,
municipal ownership of public utilities
and needs of the city, and opposing the
construction of a bridge across the estuary.
-His position among his associates and
â¢in politics adds considerable interest to
his article. It Is without doubt the most
decisive manifesto issued in many months
"in this locality, and will carry great weight
in the coming Non-Partisan convention,
which will nominate officers for the spring
.election. He says Alameda has always
been in the van of progress, and will no
doubt continue so in the years to come.
He then continues:
-- Its residents and taxpayers when once
aroused are progressive and energetic, and de-

terminod to secure the best results for their
expended money. This determination has
been shown in the beautiful/ homes, Jjeautiful
streets, splendid and unexcelled system of
sewerage, and .in fact in every branch of pub
lic improvement.
Regarding municipal ownership he deals
entirely with the lighting and insurance
propositions, alter expressing a hope that
the city will buy the motor company s
plant. He says:
Gas and electricity are vying with each
other for supremacy for lighting purposes.
The city electric light plant is a step in the
right direction, and as it gains in customers
our taxes for street lighting service will be re
duced until by another year I hope to be able
to say that our taxes lor lighting the streets
have been wiped out. A feature oi the electric
lighting will no doubt be inaugurated, allow
ing eacn private consumer to burn one lamp
at bis entrance tree, thus lighting the street
in lront of his residence and obviating the
necessity of street lamps, and at the same lime
beautifying the street on which he lives. _a*>
costs $2 per 1000 feet ior lighting, or $1 To
per 1000 feet for heating, ami is rapid. y com
ing into general use. A reduction oi the price
will be the next welcome step, either by com
petition or by municipal ownership and con
trol.
The efficiency of our Fire Department with
the facilities at hand compares favorably with
any in the State. The looses frcm fire have
averaged about #4000 per year, which is about
10 per cent of the premium paid for in.-*urance.
1 have thought that Alameda as a munici
pality might insure all the property within its
limits and the extra premiums would pay for
a well-equipped lire department. This prin
ciple would apply only to residence cities.
The public library and tidal canal are
handled iv a fashion that will receive the
support of the entire city, in the following
language:
The new City Hall is large enough to fulfill
its requirements for all time to come. The
next municipal improvement will be a free
library building on the lot already owned by
the Library Board. This will add to the at
tractiveness of the City Hall and will be a
(.rent stride in the literary advancement of
our city. One of the improvements that will
bo most welcome is a postoflice bui. ding for
Alameda, It will be appreciated by the peo
ple. By far the most Important permanent
improvement to be realized is the completion
of the tidal canal, now under course of con
struction, connecting Oakland harbor with
San Leandro Bay.
This work, with the dredging and filling on
the north side of the city, has been under way
for twenty years until it has become very tire
some to our people. When completed it will
give deep water to all points on that side of
the peninsula and afford great opportunities
for the building of warehouses, wnnrves and
factories. In the near future allstreets should
be opened to the water at both ends, and
should be provided with wharves and storage
facilities. The proper location for the great
grain wharves and warehouses is at the- west
and north sides of the city.
In closing, he says:
1 am opposed to the building of any bridges
across the estuary. The only proper way to
develop ti.e sections bordering upon the estu
ary is to give shipping unobstructed access,
and to do this a tunnel large enough for
trains, electric cars and pedestrians should be
constructed under the estuary. On the south
side 1 would like to see a bulkhead con
structed from High street to Pacific avenue,
miking a wide boulevard and forming one of
the chief attractions of the city, at the same
time bringing into market sufficient properly
to pay ior the improvements.
SOME OLD HISTORY.
Mayor Davie Asks Why It Does Not '
ltepeat Itself at This
Time.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. B.â Mayor Davie
recalled some past history to-day when he i
saw in the papers that the Valley road
might terminate at Richmond Point. He I
said in an interview:
We are certainly residents of a remarkable j
city. I cannot think what the outside world
must be saying of us. Four years ago I started
the greatest crusade agaii.st the existing rail
road monopoly that was ever known and it
has borne good fruit. Now there is tne great
est opportunity that was ever known to secure
tbe terminal of a genuine competing road,
backed by ample capital and free from every
suggestion of S-iuthern Pacific influence and
what do we seeâ not an effort of any kind to
ward securing it.
The Valley Railroad people have been In
specting the coast all arouni our county, and
yet none of the official or mercantile boards
has extended them a we. come or ever offered
to escort them around. This would not be
surprising in some towns, but in Oakland, 1
where the City Council and the Board of j
Works always profess to be such anti-railroad
folks, whit can one think of it .' ltis sufficient
to convey the idea that Oakland cfficials are ;
i aiiti-raitroad for political purposes only.
Everything that 1 hayÂ« introduced during the I
las: two years has been very quietly snubbed
Dy Messrs. Wilson and Peirsol on one hand and
Mr. Manuel and his iriends on the other; but
in this instance it seems but reasonable that
they should have done something.
The Valley Railroad must certainly want a
share of the ferry travel, and they cannot get
it at Point Richmond, and if Oakland's of
ficials are at liberty why do they not at least !
do something to let the new company know
that there is something more than wind m all
tneir talk.
The natural terminal for the Valley road Is
on the hay shore, and yet Oakland is standing
idly by and seeing the opportunity of her ex
istence pass by. When I look back and recall
the scenes of other days I cannot nelp but be
amused. I remember when Dick Knell stood
on a pile at the fool of Broadway and franti
cally signaled my ferry -ooat to come into the i
Southern Pacific wharf; i recall the night !
when Dr. Pardee and the Council went down
to tho foot of Broadway and ordered tne Street
Superintendent to wheel away the ticket
office, while anti-railroad Councllmeu picked
up rails and sweated while the world shouted.
All these things and many more are known i
to everybody iv Oakland and the men who en- |
gineered them made patriotic speeches and !
vowed that they would aid any genuine com
petition. All this appears to have been for-!
gotten. If It was done for any other than !
purely selfish motives why has it died out?
If the actions of the past were sincere why !
do not these same people now create a whoi3
some agitation and do something to show that I
the location of the terminal of the Valley road
in this city is really desired.

Miss Stella Baker, a nurse employed at

Dr. Stratton, who was then Betting the

accident, that she had swallowed thirteen
grains of morphine by mistake. The doc

to the steward and proceeded to save the
life of Miss Baker.
When she entered the hospital it was
thought she was a friend of the injured
woman, and much surprise was expressed
when she told her story. With the aid of
the stomach-pump she was relieved of the
drug before it had begun its deadly work,
and although she will recover she was vio
lently sick all day.
Miss Baker explained that Â«he bad
taken the drug by accident, but would
give the doctor no satisfaction as to where
she obtained it or where she was when she
tooK it. â¢ : ,*?
"1 have been over here nursing a pa
tient," said Miss Baker to-day, "and last
night I got hold of a wrong glass, and be
fore I lenew it had taken a large dose of
morphine. Knowing full well my danger,
1 went to the Receiving Hospital at once
and told the doctor what nad happened.
I am a nurse at the City and County Hos
pital, San Francisco, ani have been" on a
vacation which ended to-day. I cannot
tell you where I was staying when I swal
lowed the morphine, but I do most posi
tively assert that I had not the remotest
idea of taking it with suicidal intent;
neither did I do it because of any man.
My parents live in San Francisco and I
have the brightest of futures and cannot
think how anybody could get the idea
I wished to end my life"
This morning Miss Baker telephoned to
Fabiola Hospital for Dr. Hopkins, who
she said was a friend of hers, and told
him of her accident. He saw nt once that
everything had been done for Miss Baker,
and that she was in no danger, and as he
was not at the hospital the latter part of
the day, it is presumed he went to San
Francisco to tell her relatives of her mis
hap. _?*?*-.'-' '

REJOICING AT BERKELEY.
Congratula'ions Over the First
Passage of the "One Cent"
Bill
Professors and Students Will Hold a
Jol.ifi.ation if It Finally
Become-, a Law.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. There was
great rejoicing among the faculty and
students at the State University this after*
noon when the news was spread abroad
that the "1 cent additional tax" had
passed tbe Assembly. The proa test source
of satisfaction was the fact that the meas
ure had been carried without a dissenting
voice, which signal victory for the univer
sity brought the further assurance that
the bill will pass the Senate and become a
law.
The first word relative to the carrying
of the measure was received at 3:45 o'clock
from Hon. William R. Davis, ex-Mayor of
Oakland and president of the Alumni
Association. His message read as follows:
Sacramento, Feb. 8, 3:30 p. m.
President Martin Krt'ogci. Berkeley, . a..- Uni
versity bill, unaltered, pa-fed Assembly to
day. Congratulations. William R. Davis.
Later another dispatch came from How
ard E. Wrieht, Assemblyman from the
Fifty-third District, which includes the
university. It read as follows:
Sacramento, Feb. 8, 4:19 p. m.
i President Martin Kellogg, Berkeley. Cat.: In
name of university I congratulate you. The
bill passed the Assembly unanimously this
afternoon on final passage.
Howard E. Weight.
These two telegrams were placed on the
bulletin-board in a conspicuous place, and
within a few minutes they were sur
rounded by a body of enthusiastic pro
fessors and students, who stretched their
necks in eagerness to read the golden
word.. *
.. Congratulations were passed from hand
to hand and a general rejoicing took place.
As the passage of the bill in the Senate
and its signing by the Governor means
that the annual income of the university
will be increased in the neighborhood of
$250,000 visions of pillared halls, marbled
corridors, monuments of modern arcui
tecture, bronze drinking -fountains, broad
crass plats and \ paved walks and
drives, to talce the place of
some of the present humble wooden
structures, 'the lowly tents and prime
val campus, began to loom up before the
eyes of the students. The future univer
sity of California with its spacious accom
modations and elegant appointments to
sunersede the present crowded classrooms
appeared to them as a dream.
Should tlie bill pass tbe Senate and be
signed by the Governor it is probable that
a jollification such as has never been seen
before at Berkeley will take place. ,

"On many occasions," said Comrade
Woodruff to-day, "Major McKinley and I
have kept watch side by side. Our regi
ment was the first one in Ohio to enlist
for a three years' term of service and was
mustered in on June 11, 1861. We were in
twenty-one battles, and during that expe
rience every member of the company that
survived felt as thouch they were mem
bers of one family. In our regiment was
Captain Otis of the Los Angeles Times;
G. â H. Hubbard, Mayor of Sacramento,
who was first lieutenant; W. S. Rosecrans,
who was colonel; Stanley Mattnews, lieu
tenant-colonel, and Rutherford B. Hayes.
Major McKinley is the second President
that has been elected from that regiment,

with great pleasure to meeting his old
comrade under circumstances so very dif
ferent from those which confronted them

OFFICIAL SALARIES CUT.

Easy for Tbem to Express
Their Feelings.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, Feb. 8. J '
Alameda County office-holders do not
view with satisfaction the proposed cuts
in their salaries which the legislators have
decided upon, in this respect the officials
are in a very unpleasant situation. They
each furnished a statement of their re
ceipts and expenditures for the past year,
and the people were surprised to learn
what a very email share of the appropria
tions made -to each office was left after
they had paid their deputies. On this
showing the officials made it appear that
it would be suicidal to make any cut. The
legislators, however, have decided to at
tach a fixed salary to each office and to
pay tho deputies from the county funds.
The salaries are somewhat higher than
the amounts the officials said they were
receiving, and consequently it was ex
pected they would heartily welcome the
change, but somehow or other they do not.

follows:

RECTOR BOLTON INVITED.
Rev. Marshall Law Invites His
Brother Divine to a Debate
in Church.
A Little Editorial in " Choir and
Nave" That Has Created Great
Interest.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 8. J
A little leaflet published at the Church
of the Advent is issued weekly. It is
called the "Choir and Nave," and Rev.
V. Marshall Law is editor, proprietor and
publisher. _Kv77
The edition circulated in the church
yesterday contained the following edi
torial, which has created much interest,
and the ongregalion is anxious to know
whether R*v. W. W. Bolton of San Fran
cisco will .appear and debate with the
rector.
Last Tuesday the rector called upon the
Rev. W. W. Bolton at the rectory ou Union
street, near Steiner, in San Francisco, and had
a plain talk with him about extreme ritual
istic practices which have been such a stum
bling-block to some of our candidates for con
firmation, and thereby learned from the gen
tleman himself his grounds for these prac
tices. Mr. Bolton was verr courteous and
gave his reasons frankly, and while they did
not at all convince the rector of the tenable
ness of his position, it was a satisfaction to get
these reasons at first hand and to hear him say
that he us.d these ceremonial practices with
calmest premeditation.
The rector proposes on next Wednesday
evening, at the Church of the Advent, to give
an account of this interview with Mr. Bolton,
and to ask Mr. Bolton himself to b_ present to
see that the rector fairly represents the inter
view. He will be invited into the chancel and
given an opportunity to explain bis grounds
further if he desires. It will be a quiet and
dispassionate review for the enlichtenment of
such of our people as are troubled," and no
words will be indulged in which cannot be
properly used in Mr. Bolton's presence. A
talk of two hours with him has convinced the
rector that such a talk for our general enlight

COLLEGIANS PLAY BALL.
Berkeley Seniors Easily De
feated by the Juniors in the
Season's First Game.
The '98 Men Run Up a Score of 24 '0 5
Stepped at the End of the
Sixth Inning.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. B.â Tbe first
baseball game of the season at the State
University was held this afternoon be
tween the seniors and juniors, resulting
in a score of 24 to 5 in favor of the junior.--.
The '98 men had things their own way
from the start, and had run up such a big
score tbat when the seventh inning was
about to open the seniors threw up the
bat and called quits. In the first inning
! ench side made two runs. In the second
'98 made five runs and in the third six
runs. In the fourth the '98 procession
started, and before the end of the inning
they had made twelve tallies. The bat
tin- was good on both sides, but on ac
count of the slippery condition of part of
the diamond good field work was ren
dered difficult in the extreme.
Following was the make-up of the two
teams:
Seniors. Position. Juniors.

A. Els ton Pitcher..... Jarvis

Deane Second Base Budd
Osmont Third Base Blaslngame

Football Men to Meet.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. B.â Captain
Haskell, the newly elected leader of
Berkeley's football forces, has already
commenced planning for next Thansgiv
ing day's contest with Stanford. He is
sued a call to-day for all football men to
meet him to-morrow afternoon, when
matters of interest concerning training
and preparation for the game will be dis
cussed. Haskell proposes to take time by
the forelook and prove whether there is
any virtue in the policy, as practiced by
Eastern gridiron athletes, of being con
tinuously in training. A course of pre
liminary work will be begun at once. This
will be entirely contrary to precedent on
the Pacific Coast, as at no time hitherto
has any pretense been made at systematic
work at a time more than four months
distant from the contests.
Again Postponed.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 8. -The com
mittee in charge of the grand reception to
be paid to Dr. and Mrs. Joseph Le Conte
at Mark Hopkins Institute of Art in San
Francisco has announced that the recep
tion has again been postponed till Thurs
day evening, February 18.

BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. B.â Sixteen

cents, are reported to be at the State In
stitute for the Deaf and Dumb and Blind
at the present time. There are 200 chil
dren in the school. . Numerous other cases
have also been reported from various sec
tions of the town.
Mumps .are also prevalent. In one of
the Greek Letter fraternity houses alone
out of a membership of sixteen there are
four cases.
Miss Wheeler Improving.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. B.â Miss Lulu
Wheeler ot Addison street, accidently shot
, in the leg a week ago, is reported to be
j much improved. The physicians say that
1 she will be confined to her room for at
least a fortnight longer.

UNITARIANS WANT
A TREATY TRIBUNAL
They Commend the Arbitra
tion Treaty Recently
Negotiate d.
Addresses by Dr. Jordan, Rev'
Mr. Adams, Bernard Moses,
Dr. Stebbins, Col. Irish.
Dr. Jordan's Severe Comments Upon
the Seal Fisheries Arbi
tration.
The regular banquet of members of the
Unitarian Club took place at the Cali
fornia last night. There were over a hun
dred persons present, many of them
among the most prominent in the City.
The banquet, which was elaborate, lasted
about an hour and a half.
The question to be discussed was the
general one of arbitration as it has been
brought forward between this country
and England.
Dr. David Starr Jordan spoke in regard
to the fur seals of Alaska. He told of his
recent visit to the rookeries and went into
figures to show that the seals were de
creasing and needed to be protected.
The doctor went into the history of the
contest between England and the United
States as to their respective claims to the
seals. He commended Dr. Merriam, who ;
was sent theresome years ago to make in
vestigations for the United States.
"If America had let Dr. Merriam re
main there long enough there would have
been no arbitration," said the doctor; "we
would have had the fur seals, and that
wouldhave been the end of it.
"One contention was that the seals were
ours wherever they were, and another was
that they ought to be preserved. There
have been 600,000 females killed at sea,
400,000 pups have starved to death and
600,000 young unborn seals have been
killed with their mothers.
"Great Britain has laid herself out for a
compromise. That is what she wanted.
She had no right and she was willing to
compromise. Before the Paris tribunal
there was no agreement of what the facts
were. When the contestants came before
the tribunal, no conditions having been
agreed upon, one set of arguments was
just as good as another. The Canadian
affidavits cost the price of the drinks; the
American affidavits got through the secret
service probably cost thousands of dollars.
We provided for a compromise and no
compromise was possible."
Dr. Jordan went into all the minute de
tails of the life of the fur seals, the dif
ferent methods of killing them, the atti
tude of Russia, and finally said that the
decision of the Paris tribunal was really
in our favor. Many cheers were given
Dr. Jordan at the close of his address.
The Rev. Dr. George C. Adams of the
Congregational Church was announced as
tbe next speaker. He said that, being a
minister, he had prepared a talk along the
lines of peace.
"The most hateful quarrels ever known
have been family quarrels. Any one who
has read the "Origin of Nations" must
have been impressed with the truths
brought forward in it. It is to the spirit
of concession that I desire to call your at
tention. The concessions shown by Abra
ham and Isaac resulted in great strength
to them. It is so in all similar cases. !
There is a relation of nations as well as of
individuals. 1 think it was in I&J4 that j
the first work on international law was
written.
"General Grant could hardly bear the
sight of the wounded in battle. It sick
ened him and, like many other great
men, he wanted war no more. War drags
down and never lifts up. The nation
best prepared for war is the best prepared !
for peace." Â£sl___P
Professor Bernard Moses of the State â¢
University spoke on the attitude of demo- i
crats and democracy in this country
toward arbitration. He said if we were a
monarchy we would have a different .
opinion regarding arbitration. The na- '
tions most stiffly for monarchy are most
stiffly for war. If there is no other settle- j
ment for disputes but tbe European way, I
then there is no other way for us. The {
spirit of war has not died out. The rising i
generation is as eager for war as the one ]
that has passed. This is not an age of j
peace. Never were there so many im- I
portant wars as during this century. But |
in arbitration is the basis, the hope of our j
republican civilization.
The Rev. Dr. Stebbins was called on to
speak on arbitration and Christianity.
He said singular as it might seem Chris
tianity was rather a vague term.
"But the intent of it is the welfare of
men, of nations and the human race. Tne
world has been governed by fear and force
and is largely so governed now. The
ignominy of having nothing worth fighting
lor is worse than war. The principal
feature of this treaty is that it is fairly
proposed. What becomes of it ii destined
to have a great effect on future genera
tions. I take great pride in it.
"I ask you to believe in this arbitration,
hope for it, work for it. A great principle
is immortal. It never dies."
He received much applause for his ad
ress. The president asked for an expres
dion of opinion. He said Horace Davis
Fhad provided a resolution, and he asked
for the reading of it. It was read by
Sheldon Kellogg, and was unanim ously
adopted as follows:
Resolved, By the Unitarian Club of Califor
nia" that any differences or disputes arising
between the United States and Great Britain,
which cannot be adjusted by diplomatic
agencies, should be referred to arbitration,
and that a tribunal for that Ipurpote ought to
be established by treaty arrangements between
the two nations.
Horace Davis said the only objection he
had to it was that it was not strong
enough. He wanted something that
would ask the support of the United
States Senate.
Mr. Kellogg then submitted the follow
ing supplementary resolution:
Resolved, That the Unitarian Club of Califor
nia commends the general arbitration treaty

recently negotiated by the representatives of
the two English-speaking nations as an epoch
making achievement of modern civilization,
and earnestly desires that the United States
Senators from the State of California shall
support such treaty with their entire ability
and influence, and oppose any amendment
which may endanger its adoption or impair
its success.
Colonel John P. Irish made an able ad
dress in favor of the adoption of the sup
plementary resolution. "He pleaded for
diplomacy and peaceful solutions of inter
national difficulties. He said every time
he went to Washington he had noticed, as
he did a^ain only three weeks ago when
last mere, the Monroe tendency of things.
He asked for the upholding of National
dignity without war, and for a generous
and hearty support of the coming admin
istration, and of all administrations,
whatever their party complexion.
He referred to the presence in the
audience of a distinguished gentleman
who was soon to be a member of McKin
ley's Cabinet, and asked for the support
of Mr. Kellogg's resolution. This "was
given by unanimous vote.
A GRAFTER'S TRICK.
J. E. Blomroan, a Carpenter, in Search
of a Warrant, Is Swindled
Out of Â«_().
The grafters around the Police courts
have been for weeks studiously keeping
away from the Larkin-street corridor of
the City Hall, owing to the orders of the
Chief of Police to Policeman Wagner to
arrest tbem on sight.
*_esterday morning, however, a smart
trick was played by one of them upon J.
E. Blomross. a carpenter living at 9 How
ard street. Blomross was in the Larkin
street corridor when a young man ac
costed him asking if he could render any
assistance.
Blomross said he wanted a search war
rant for a chest of tools belonging to him
which Thomas Heyman, 118 East street,
was unlawfully keeping in his possession.
The young man said he would soon fix
that and told Blomross to wait for a few
minutes. He returned and handed Blom
ross two papers and said his fee would be
$6. Blomross gave him a $20 gold piece
to get changed, but the young man did not
return with the $14.
After waiting fox nearly an hour Blom
ross went to Judge Low and told him
what had occurred. The Judge looked at
the papers and found that a blank bail
bond bad been used as a complaint and
an order of discharge as a warrant, tbe
latter reading "to discharge from custody
a set of tools."
Blomross got a proper search warrant
and will do all in his power to discover
the young man who swindled him out of
his $20. He described him as about 21
years of age, medium height, stout build,
smooth face and fair complexion.
WARY OF ARBITRATION.
Father McFadden Says England
Is Waiting to Hoodwink
Americans.
Stirring Toasts and Speeches at
St. Patrick's Alliance
Banquet.
Flowers and the emblem of liberty were
in evidence last night at the annual ban
quet and monthly meeting of Unity Alli
ance No. 14, St. Patrick's Alliance of
America, it took place in the hall of the
Knights of the Red Branch at Mason and
O'Farrell streets.
The business meeting, at which business
of a routine nature only was said to bave
been done, preceded the banquet.
The tables were three in number, with
a crossbar of white linen, silver, plates
and delicacies at the top, the whole sug
gesting a trident. Tables of lesser size
but greater elevation were set on the plat
forms at the head of the hall. These
were occupied by officers of Alliance No. 1.
The how of Irish wit, island sentiment;
loyalty to the flags, both "the stars and
stripes" and the eloquent green, was con- I
tinued three hours and over. It was en- i
joyed and app auded by all.
President William Mulvin also officiated
as toastmaster. He made a witty saluta- '
tory to each toast. The responses to the
principal toasts were made by the follow
ing gentlemen, the toasts being preceded
by an address of general interest by State j
President of the Alliance O. F. Rooney of
Oakland:
D. L. Callahanâ Land We Live In.
Jeremiah Deasyâ Celtic Union.
Charles O'Brienâ The Times of Our Fathers
and Forefathers.
F. B. Huntâ Progressive Unity of the Alii- {
ance.
Rev. Father McFadden of Ireland, who !
is understood to be in this country in the
interest of the promotion of freedom ior
Ireland, made a speech, which was one of
I the most enthusiastically applauded of
the evening. It complimented the Presi
dent first, and later on touched on inter
national politics.
Father McFadden knows what it is to

THIRD STREET TO SHINE.
Fifteen Arc Lights "Will Blaze Up Next
Saturday Night.
Third street will, on and after next Sat
urday evening, be classed as one of the
progressive business streets of San Fran
cisco. From that date electric lights will
shine over its pavement from Mission to
Harrison street, and there is positive
assurance that one week later the block
from Market to Mission will follow the
example.
Through the energy of H. S. Hughes,
president of the Third-street Improve
ment Club, assisted by William Hendricl.
son, Joseph Silverman, Sylvain Levy and
Gerson Hershall, the necessary amount of
$50 per month for each of the three blocks
was guaranteed. The contract will run
for one year at the rate of $150 a month,
and will give five arc lights to each block,
or fifteen in all. This number the com
mittee thinks will be ample, as each lamp
will be provided with a new kind of re
flector, which it is thought will turn all
the light, generally lost above the lamp,
down to the earth.
As so many property-owners on the
block from Market to Mission had refused
to subscribe for light recourse was had to
storekeepers. They have promised Ber
nard Katschinski and A. Becker, the com
mittee that waited on them, tbe necessary
amount, and the committee will negotiate
for five arc lights at once.
The next movement 10 be agitated by
this club will be to have that street bitu
minlzed from Market to Folsom.

Frank Taylor, a Sailor,
Arrested for Many
Burglaries.
He Was Caught While Prowling
Around a House on Post
Street. .
A Large Quantity of Stolen Property
Recovered in tbe Room He
Occupied.
One of 'the men who are believed^to have
been committing the recent numerous
burglaries in this city and Oakland is
now in the "tanks" at the City prison,
and evidence has already been secured
against him on several charges of burg
lary.
He is Frank Taylor, a sailor, 32 years
of age, and he is credited by tbe police
with making use of his experience on
FRANK TAYLOR.
j board ship to climb porches and entering
j houses by the upper windows while the
[ family would be at dinner.
Saturday night Policeman W. H. Heines
was on special duty in plain clothes, and
he saw a man coming out of an alleyway
on Post street, near Scott. He did not
like the man's appearance, and asked him
what he was doing there. Taylor, who
was the man, said he was looking for No.
1329. Heines knew there wa3 no such
number on the street, and be became con
vinced Taj 'lor was there for no good pur
pose.
Heines searched him and found a car
penter's chisel and a putty-knife in his
pockets. Notwithstanding Taylor's pro
testations that he was an nonest carpen
ter Heines took Dim to the City prison
and locked him up in the "tanks."
Detectives Bee and Harper were de
tailed to investigate into Taylor's case,
and when they had a look at him in the
j "tanks" they recognized him as the man
they had been looking for. They ques
tioned him, but for a long time were un
able to get any satisfactory replies, but
finally Taylor succumbed and told them
that they would find something in his
room on Third street, near Brannan.
The detectives had recovered a sealskin
cape which Taylor had pawned in a shop
in Oakland. It had been stolen on the
night of January 10 from the residence of
S. Anspacher, 2604 Pacific avenue, along
with $175 in money and a lot of valuable
jewelry.
They were satisfied that Taylor was in
the burglary and yesterday sent for the
pawnbroker in Oakland, who - immedi
ately identified Taylor as the man who
pawned the sealskin cape. . .-.'."..
Taylor had stubbornly refused to give
the detectives information as to his room,
but after his identification he weakened
and told them it was in a lodging-house
on Third street, near Brannan.
The detectives: went to the room and
discovered a large quantity of stolen
property. There was a lot of valuable
jewelry, stolen from the residence of S.
Bessinser, 1601 Scott street, on the night
of January 28; another lot of valuable
jewelry, stolen irom the residence of A.
-Stein berger, 1528 Sutter street, on the
night of January S.
There was also a lot of silverware, stolen
from the residence of Dr. Cornwall in
Oakland, and a lot of jewelry which was
stolen from the residence of a gentleman
named Alexander in Oakland, along with
a pocketbook containing some money.
Many other articles were recovered, ap
parently the products of other burglaries.
'They are awaiting identification by the
owners.
Taylor is a first-class able seaman and
has good certificates from different skip
pers under whom he has sailed. He says
he came from Portland about four or five
weeks ago, aDd he must have commenced
breaking into houses almost immediately
after his arrival. The capture is looked
upon as a most important one at police
headquarters.

Sonoma Citizens Who Desire More
Picnics Up there.
Forty-one business men and citizens of

SIXTH STREET TO RALLY.
Its Enterprising Residents Issue
a Stirring Call to
Arms.
A Mass-Meeting to Ba Held To-Night
to Whoop Up Things and H.lp
the Thoroughfare.
The following stirring call to a meeting
to take place this evening has been issued
by the Sixth-street Improvement Club;
To the Sixth-street Property-Owners â Dear
Sirs: Term us to address you in behalf of our
efforts. You jiust certainly be aware of the
existence of our organization, composed as it
is solely of the merchants who are your ten
ants. In perusing the morning papers of re
cent dates you no doubt have read of the en
terprise, zeal and unselfish ardor that we dis
play in promoting and furthering the best In
terests ol the street.
San Francisco is awakening from her
lethargic state. That seeming chronic com
plaint, inertia,' that disease that so long im
peded tne onward march of our community,
has been driven forever from our midst. The
cry of the hour is progress, improvement, for
ward.' Streets and sections innumerable have
organized and amalgamated. Before this
mighty irresistible array of unity every ob
stacle and every obstruction of silurianism
has been swept aside.
Shall Sixth street be included in this mighty
upheaval of public enterprise or shall she be
thrust back to the ignominious condition of
"Rotten Row."
Shall Sixth street, one of the fairest jewels
in the diadem of realty, be, os virtually she
should be, in the van of "this on ward sweep, or
must she endure the contempt oi our City as a
"has been."
The position of your tenants in this mat
ter is self-evident "What is your position?"
Every Improvement on Sixthstreet is an im
provement to your property.
Bobtail cars and cobble-paved streets detract,
electric lines and bituminous pavements en
hance. To improve the street and enhance
your realty; induce the return of the patron
age which has departed but which by all vir
tue belongs to us; to keep abreast with the
timesâ that is the goal we strive to attain.
Your co-operation in this matter is imperative.
The City Fathers will not accord us the
proper recognition without your identifica
tion. The removal of one of our heretofore
steadiest and representative merchants of the
street must arouse you to a full realization of '
obvious defects.
We ask you in all fairness and justice to join
our ranks to lend your voice and presence to
the consummation of this most vital project.
You are respectfully invited to attend a
grand meeting to be held at Music Hall, cor
ner Mission and Mary streets, between Fifth
and Sixth, Tuesday evening, February 9, 1897,
at 8 o'clock sharp. We will not waste the
evening with desultory preliminaries and argu
ments. Yours respectfully,
Sixth-street Improvement Club.

THIS WILL BE A
YEAR OF PLENTY
Cheering Report of Presi
dent Watkins of the
Board of Trade.
Every Indication Points to a
Revival o. Business on a
Sound Foundation.
Unless Some Surprise Is Sprung Upon
the Country Nothing Can
Hold It Beck.
The annual meeting of the Board of
Trade was held yesterday at which a
board of directors was elected for the year
and the reports of the officers were read.
That of President A. A. Watkins gives a
general review of the year that is passed,
with another review of the conditions
that he prophesies wili develop a year of
unprecedented prosperity into which we
have already entered. The report is
cheerful reading in and out of business
circles. It says:
The year just passed has been a try
ing: one to all engaged in business.
Hard times have been an epidemic
which extended from one side of the
continent to the other, and most busi
ness men parted with the year 1896
with small regrets. On the whole it is
a wonder that with the many disturb
ing influences it got through as well as
it did. The year started out with a
severe political congest staring it in
the face and a possibility of a change
in the currency system whicli filled the
hearts of business men with terror.
The diminution of the treasury reserve
by the continued exports of gold,
which could be checked only by the
issuance of Government bonds, created
a feeling of distrust.
1897 starts out not confronted with
any such apprehensions; without that
feeling of hopelessness that permeated
the business world at the beginning of
last year; the gold reserve in the treas
ury advanced to the point at which it
was held iv the years of our greatest
prosperity. The immense favorable
balance of trade â largest ever gained in
the history of the Government â the
absence of any fear of gold exports for
many months at least and the generally
acknowledged good prospects for favor
able prices for wheat, agricultural and
horticultural products; the revival of
interest in the mining industry on the
Pacific Coast and the increased gold
product in this State in 1896â the largest
since 1883 â all add to the feeling of con
fidence.
On every hand are evidences of im
proving times. The conditions are all
most favorable for a prosperous year.
There is no hill it in anything prices
are all low, and business as a whole is
upon a sound foundation.
A speech recently delivered by An
drew Carnegie on the business situation
concluded with these words:
â¢â¢Unless some surprise is sprung upon
the country nothing can hold it back
from a period of genuine prosperity.
These thoughts are in accord with
the views generally expressed by the
foremost business men throughout the
country. I trust that their expectations
may realized, and hope that at the
close of another twelve month% you can
all look hack with gladness, unmixed
with sorrow, upon the year now opening.
The directors re-elected were: For term
of three years â __. Xickelsburg, S. Feucht
wanger, Isaac Up bam.
or the unexpired term of two years â
William duff.
Isaac Upham succeeded A. L. Scott for
the three-year term and William Cluff
succeeded Frank Brigham for the unex
pired term of two years.

original papers. John Mean, y was appa

AFTER A SUNSEN ROCK.
Survey Steamer McArthur Will
Drag for a Dangerous
Obstruction.
The Pinnacle on Which the C.n
tesima Struck Is the Obj.ctof
the Search.
The United States Government has de
termined to solve the mystery of the in
jury to the British ship Centesima, which
occurred on December 13 last, and has
ordered the survey-steamer McArthur to
search forthe dangerous pinnacle that has
cost the owners of the vessel $25,000,
Pilot Freeman, who is considered one of
the most careful men in the business, was
in charge of the Centesima â a steel ship of
2800 tons â when she struck, and he sailed
on the McArthur yesterday morning, at
the request of the National authorities, to
assist in the search for the rock.
The Centesima was coming down the
north channel in a terrific gale when she
struck the obstruction. She was in tow of
a tug, and when in water that was sup
posed to be ample lor a vessel of her
draught careened to port as a swell let her
I down on the rock. Another swell took
; her over the pinnacle, and she struck on
j the port side with sufficient force to send
I her reeling to starboard.
The lead was used as quickly as possi-
I ble, and it gave ten and one-half fatnoms
i of water, showing that the rock must jut
; sharply from the bottom. Pilot Freeman
' claimed then, and still asserts, that he
j was well within the channel and that the
rock on which the vessel struck was one
that has been missed by former surveys,
and that it is not on any of the charts fur
nished by the Government.
Tne officers who keep track of the bar
and soundings of the channels by which
vessels reach this port claim that the pilot
is mistaken, but the rock is to be searched
for, nevertheless.
Captain Freeman will direct the Mc-
Arthur to a point as near as he can calcu
late to the place where the Centesima
struck, ana then the drags, by which such
obstructions are located, will be towed
backward and forward until the vexed
question is settled.
