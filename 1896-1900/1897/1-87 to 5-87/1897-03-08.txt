GREECE IS NOT
YET READY TO
LEAVE CRETE.
Makes a Spirited Reply to the
Ultimatum of the
Powers.
PREPARING FOR THE CONFLICT.
iAs Soon as King George's Defiant Answer
Is Delivered the United Fleets of
Turkey's Friends Will Proceed to
Blockade the Piraeus.
LONDON, Eno.. March 7.â A dispatch
to the Central News from Athens gives
the following summary of the reply to the
ultimatum of the powers which Greece
will hand to the diplomats to-morrow
when the time expires in which a reply
can be made.
It will recall that Greece in 1896 in de
ference to the wish of the powers used her
influence with the Cretans to induce them
to accept reforms by Turkey. It will
point out that the continued unsettled
state <jf the island is a proof of the futili
ties of reform.
With reeard to the autonomy of the
island, the reply will state that it isfor the
Cretans to decide whether they will accept
it or not.
It will declare that the evacuation of
Crete by Greece is impossible, because
peace, to restore which Greek troops and
warships were sent to the island, remains
seriously disturbed.
FIRM IS Ut.K JitSCl.rt.
Greece ft ill Aot V*. if to the Mandate of
the I'otPfrm.
ATHENS, Greece, March 7.â The time
to' Greece's formal reply to the ultima turn
oi ihe combined powers is rapully diaw
ing nigh, and though it is generally known
that that reply will be a refusal of the
terms that are sought to be imposed there
is intense anxiety that the answer be de
livered. It is known that all Europe is
alert to hear the words of Greece, which,
perhaps, will mean much to the armed
millions who have never actually followed
the trade of war. It is believed that the
life or death of thousands of men hangs
upon the words that Greece will speak,
and these words, therefore, are not to be
lightly spoken.
But Greece is firm in her resolve not to
bow to the mandate of those so-called
Christian powers who have expressed their
willingness to go to almost any extreme
to support the rule of Turkey. The
hitherto impotent conce-t of Europe will
in a few hours find its embarrassments in
creased by the defiance of Gieece, and the
Greeks will accept the arbitrament of war
rather than drag their national honor in
the dust by submitting to the orders of
the aliies of the Turk.
It is evident that the power? intend to
carry into effect their threat to blockade
the Piraeus, the port of Athens, as soon as
Greece's answer is delivered to them. A
number of the warships of Great Britain
and the other powers are now in the
vicinity of the Piraeus, and it is believed
they are there for the sole purpose of
blockading the port.
The one bright spot in the situation to
day is that the enforcement of me recent
decree calling out the last two remaining
classes of reserves has been postponed.
In diplomatic circles this is taken to mean
that there will be afforded an opportunity
for further negotiations, though the tem
per of tbe people is against any further
dallying with words.

I CANEA. Crete. March 7.â lt is believed
were that the reply of Greece to the de
mands of the powers will De a positive re
fusal to obey and that a bloody struggle
is, tliereiore, inevitable unless the powers
recede from their position. It is known
; hat colonel Vassos, the commander of
the Greek army of occupation, has re
ceive 1 instructions from King George to
hold all the posts in the isJand now occu
pied" by the Greek troops and to resist to
the bitter end any at.emp to dislodge
him. The information reaches here that
the Greek troops are enthusiastic over the
determination of their King not to order
their withdrawal from the island, and it
is believed it will take a far stronger force
than their own to dislodge them from the
slragetic positions they occupy. The
events of the next few days are anxiously
awaited.
Last night the insurgents, who are be
sieging the blockhouse at MaJaxa, made
an attempt to blow up the place with
dynamite, but were frustrated by the
vigilance of the Mo-lem defenders. For
several hours after the failure of tue at
tempt there was a lively fusillade, but the
resul.t is not known here.
A timiisr attempt was made on the
fort at Ktratini, and here the insurgents
were more successful. The explosion
made a breach iii the walls of the fort,
killing four Turks and - wounding many
pothers. The Turks, though brave fighters,
I .ive been made very nervous by .he use
of dynamite by the insurgents, this being
a method of warfare of wnich they have
bad no experience. '
LONDON, Eng., March 7.â The Daily
[News will tomorrow claim to be able to
predict that there is every hope of a
speedy and satisfactory as well as peaceful
solution of the Cretan' trouble. It will add
tbat Greece's reply to the note of - the
The San Francisco Call
poweis will, by statins her reasons, leave
the door open for further negotiations,
though she will not accept the conditions
laid down by the powers.
The paper gives discursively the prob
able terms of the reply, which are similar
to those contained in the dispatch to the
Central News.
A Constantinople dispatch to the Daily
News says it is understood that Greece i*
willing to withdraw her fleet from Cretan
waters, but suggests that her troops remain
on the island to assist in restoring order.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, March 7.
â The diplomats here have received the
answer of the Porte to the collective note,
presented on Tuesday last, setting forth
the desires of the powers regarding the
granting of autonomy to Crete under the
suzerainty of Turkey. The Ports assent>
to the terms ot the powers, and says it wilt
be a definite understanding between itself
and t He powers respec ing the detai.s of
the autonomy to be granted.
The reply bears out the statement of the
United Associated Presses that the Suitan
is rather glad than otherwise to have the
long Cretan question settled, even though
he loses the island.
While a number of Greek engineers
were engaged in repairing the main road
near Moluii, on the Greek frontier, pre
sumably tor the purpose 01 facilitating the
passage of troops, they were stopped by a
body of Turkish troops. A rumor reached
here to-day that a serious encounter be
tween Turks and Greeks had taken place
on the frontier, but though inquiries have
been made it has been impossible to con
firm the story. It is thought very prob
ably that t~e report originated in the
stoppage by Turkish troops of the work of
the Greek engineers a: Melun.

BERLIN, Germany, March 7.â The
powers are nowise agreed among them
selves as to the precise terms of an auton
omous administration of the affairs of the
island of Crete, nor are they in concert of
opinion as to how far Turkey shall be al
lowed provoke war in the Balkan pen
insula by massing troops on her frontiers.
Under the pretext of self-defense the
Porte is executing military plans which
no European Government would venture
upon without the backing of a plethoric
war chest, but the Porte's capacity for
military operations was manifested in the
case of the Turko-Russian war of 1876-77,
when, as now, '.he bankrup:cy of the
Ottoman empire was relied upon at) a
greater factor in the defeat of Turkey than
the cuns of the Russians. As things
turned out, though Turkey was defeated,
she found ample funds <o conduct a credit
able campaign.
STANDARD OF THE REGIMENT OF TURKISH LANCERS.
The Ottoman cavalry is a fine force, and the First Lancers is one of tbe smartest regiments in the service. They are
well mounted, drilled aud equipped, and in their general character rank with the average cavalry regiments of the great
military powers.
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, MARCH 8, 1897.
THE SUBMARINE TORPEDO-BOAT ABOUT TO ATTACK A BRITISH BATTLE -SHIP
When Yondergoltz Pasha, the German
eneral who was lent to the Sultan, or
ganized the present Turki-h army, 1-ft
the Turkish service, it was understood
that he was thoroughly disgusted
with the way things were going, and that
the severance of his relations with the
Turkish military department was ap
proved by the German Emperor. The
Sultan has paid so hieh a tribute to the
services of Vondergoltz that he has re
cently besought him to resume his posi
tion, nssurine him that he would be the
virtual commander-in-chief of the Otto
man array. The German Pasha declined
to return, but in reply to the Snltan's in
vitation ha has sent a plan of operations
to oa put into force upon the Greek
frontier, based upon his profound knowl
edge of the conations under which a cam
paign against Greece must be conducted.
A-Â» Vondergoltz Pasha when he severed
his connection with the Turkish military
administration occupied the position of
second chief of tho general staff of the
Turkish army and was also a member of
the council oT the Turkish Ministry of
War, it will be seen that h ; s advice has no
small influence in th 6 military operations
which the Porte has ftndertnkui: within
the last month or two. Moreover, the
German officers who are siill serving in
the Turkish army are Known to be fully
capable of carry-ing Yondergoltz's plans
into Â«-ffect, and the fact that m;iny of the
important commands of the Thessalian
frontier are now in the hams of German
officers may thus be accounted for.
Advices from Constantinople, based on
reliable au hority, show that the Ottoman
troops on the frontier of Thessaly, as well
as a.ong the other TurKish borders, are to
act on the offensive, and it is asserted that
if the commander-in-chief wishes he could
within a week throw 75,000 well-armed
men over the Greek frontier, including
twenty-one batteries of artillery and ten
squa'lronsof cavalry.
The headquarters of the Turkish army
of "precaution" or defense are now at
Wonastir, in Macedonia, 400 miles west of
Constantinople, and a larce force of troops
under the command of Omar and Nuchan
Pashas is much nearor the frontier. \t\

forces, tho Mustafuz, corresponding to the
German landsturm or second draft of
those liable to military duty, have been
called to arms in several districts near
the Greek borders. The ostensible reason
for summoning this contingent is that
the ordinary red iff s or reserves which
were lately called out have been deficient
in numbers, but the summoning of any
part of the Mustafuz is regarded as omi
nous of the Sultan's expectations that
something of a very serious nature is im
minent.
The attitude of Servia and Bulgaria oc
cupies the serious attention of European
diplomacy, and it is the opinion in official
circles here that the conferences which
have laken place between King Alexander
of Servia and Prince Ferdinand of Bul
earia .>ave resulted in an agreement to
make a simultaneous attack upon Turkey
when the time lor such action shall seem
opportune.
Kouruama is looked upon as having the
intention to take an active part in any
scheme of rearrnngirip tbe Balkan boun
daries that may be nut into operation.
King Charles of Roumania, as a member
of the Prussian family of Hohenzoilern,
may be relied upon to have the support of
Germany. In view of eventualities, the
works at Kustendjio, on the Black Sea,
and the defenses at Gallatz and Braille, on
the Danube, are being strengthened and
extended.

LONDON, Esq., March 7.â A large
Radical meeting was held in Hyde Par*
to-lay to give voice to the feeling in favor
of Greece, which generally obtains among j
the masses of England. Among the
speakers were Joseph Havelock Wilson,
M. Â±\ for Middlesoorough, and Edward J.

Christians in their struggle for freedom,
congratulating Greece upon her firm re

powers.
One of the resolutions urges Lord Salis

by lending its support to the Turks.
The weather was not favorable for a
large outdoor gathering, it being dull and

CHICAGO, 111., March 7.â Five hun
dred Greeks in tim City are eager to
respond to the call to arms issued yester
day by M. Skouzes, Greek Minister of For
eign Affairs. A mass meeting was held- in
the Greek Church this afternoon, at which
fiery speeches were made. Father Fiara
bolis, who two weeks ago stirred the
Greeks of this city by an eloquent appeal
in behalf of their fatherland, presided at
to-day's meeting, rie told his country
men that it was first necessary to get
money, ns lack of means stood in their
way. Yesterday a telegram wai sent to
the Consul-General in New York concern
ing the matter of funds, but no reply has
been received.
The Greek headquarters on Dearborn
street was swarming with the Hellenes to
night, who are anxious to leave at once to
enter into the fight against the Turks.
Two huudrea and fifty have already en

BALTIMORE, Ma, March 7.â Tbehoga
steel fish with lungs of bronze and elec
tricity in its fins and tail, which is to be
launched in this city in a few days, will
spit from its mouth while under water a
torpedo which will tear a hole in a man-of
war's bottom, or she can ram the enemy
witn a stout fin she carries on ber back.
She can see and breathe while under the
water. This new engine of destruction
can run on the surface of the sea at a
greater speed than most vessels; she can
hide herself and move along under the
water at any depth from an inch to seventy
feet, or can lay, if necessary, on the bot
tom for days. It is next to impossible to
sir.k this mechanical diver or drown her
crew. This 85-foot fish has a body shaped
like a cigar. It is 11 feet 6 inches in width
and depth. The hull has an inner and an
outer skin and on the bacÂ£ of the craft
there is an armored turret.
This realization of Jules Verne's dream
of "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the
Sea" is best described by sending her
forth to tight an imaginary battle with,
lbs E.ipli3h battle-ship Royal Sovereign.
The tiny submarine is manned by but ten
men and cost but $150,000. She weighs
only 138 tons. The RoyaJ Boven ign car
ries a crew of 500 men and cost $4,000,000.
The Britisher weighs 14.000 tons. Little
David has five torpedoes, while Goliath
carries four 13-inch guns, ten 6-inch guns
and twenty-eight rapid-fire guns about
her decks. About her sides is an armor
belt 18 inches in thickness. She is a float-*
ing fortress 380 feet in length and 75 feet
in width. The submarine is lying in the
harbor of some great sea coast city when
news is received that the British battle
ship is approaching the coast with the in
teniion oi bombarding the place and lay
ing tribute upon the inhabitants. The
petroleum tires under the boiler of the litÂ«
tie fighter are lighteJ â she does not burn

soon steaming out of port with two sets of
quadruple engines backed by 1(525 horse

surface at a sixteen-knot gait to meet the
dreaded thunderer from abroad.
Far out across the water there is a puff
of white smoke, a flash of red fire ana the
boom of a cannon comes in from the sea.
The Britisher has seen the little American
and has cleared his ship for action. The
shot dropped just ahead of the torpedo
boat. She was not yet within rango of
the big guns of the enemy. Scenting

water are allowed to entar the tanfcs in
the sides of the hull between the inner
and outer skins. The c;aft imiredia ely
sinks herself to tha awash condition. She
now has three feet of water over her hull,
with only her armored turrat exposed,
and she is making 15 knots an hour.
There is a second puff and a liasii and a
boom and a shell shrieks past the Ameri
can. The brave little vessel is within tiae
range of the enemy's guns.
It is decided to dive, thus takine away
the only and very unsatisfactory target
the Britisher had. The commander runs
his fingers over his electric sig.nal-board.
First the petroleum fires are ordered ex
tinguished â the furnace doors are hetme^
cally sealed. Another signal from the
turret and the smokestack and the air
shaft adjoining it are automatically drawn
down into the hull and a water-tiglit cov
ering swings over and is clamped upon
the opening through which the stack rose.
One more ton of water is admitted to the
tanks, and the buoyancy of the vessel is
almost overcome. Next two horizontal
rudders on the right and left sides of the
stern are slightly inclined upward. This
drives the craft down head lirst, and in
thirty seconds she has disappeared from
view. The enemy has nothing to fire at
but a few ripples upon the water.
As the submarine craft has a constant
tendency to rise, or a reserve buoyancy
amounting to 375 tons, she has to be
forced below by her horizontal rudders.
For awhile she is operated by the steam
left in her boilers. When this is con-
Buraed a 70-horsepower electric motor,
dnven by thirty-two tons of storage bat
teries, are coupled to the screw-. When
she reaches a depth of thirty fact the ves
sel is headed toward the Britisher. Under
the water the craft makes eight knots an
hour. The little company under the sea
is drawing its life breath from air stored
in bronze tanks at a pressure of 2000
pounds to the square inch.
It has been demonstrated by the in
ventor, through tests wbicu he has made
under the water, that it ia impossible to
see a foot ahead of you when submerged.
To keep the boat on a straight course a
triangular drag is rigged over the rudder.
This is so arranged that if the vessel
deviates from her cours^ the drag ope
rates on the rudder, throwing it to the
right or left, bringing the cfaft back upon
her course again. Afier a run of a couple
of hundred yards the boat rises to the sur
face to observe ttie enemy and also to see

if she is headed directly for her. To do
this the horizontal rudders are slightly
inclined downward ar.d the porpoise rises
to witnin three feet of the surface.
While moving along in this position a
hollow tube, four feet Ion?, is run from
the back of the boat up through the water
and a foot above the surface of the sea.
In the side of this tube, near its top, there
is a hole, and in this opening there is a
mirror. The tube is revolved from the
turret and the mirror reflects a picture of
everything on the waters and carries the
image down into the turret. The com
mander of the submarine sees the officers
giving orders from the bridge of the
Royal Sovereign and the apprehensive
crew scurrying about the deck of the bat
tle-ahip. They are maiing haste to get
out the protective nets around the ship's
hull. The submarine now dives for the
attack. She passes under the spot where
the battle-ship was eeen last, but the ex
pected shadow of the hull in the water
was absent. The foreigner was constantly
changing his course in an effort to elude
the unseen destroyer.
The American arose to the surface
again for another observation and the
battle-ship was seen just a hundred yards
ahead. She dived again, and the two
men in the bow ready to fire the torpedoes
were signaled to "stand by" for action.
Soon there was seen dead ahead tne
shadow of the invader. The order to fire
was given, and from out of the bow of the
submerged craft shot a torpedo. It was
11 feet 9 inches in lensth and 38 inches in
width. Every inch of it was crammed
with explosives. It automatically pro
pelled itself by a scrr>w ana a rudder to
ward the shadow. There was a moment
of suspense, followed by a churning of
the sea, and the Americans knew they
had hit something. As they arose to the
surface again for an observation tuey
passed throu ;h troub.ed waters, and they
saw that the nots of tho ship had been
torn and were hanging to the ship's sideÃ
in an indescribable tangle.
The troubled waters through which the
small craft had parsed proved to be the
wake of the # L>attle-ship which was gath
ering headway and making ready to put
out to sea again. Quickly the Americans
got below again and found the Britisher's
shadow over tbeir hearts. A button wa3
pressed, a second torpedo left the bow and
disappeared in the gloom beyond. Those

heave and raise beneath them. Water

bows of the big warship. Tue bow ro<e
Â»p, tottered and then fell back into the
Bea, while the whole ship labored and
trembled as if &he were in a gale. The
officers on the bridge stood still with
blanched faces. The crew were transfixed
at their posts. No one moved, no one
spoke. Then the engineers and stokers
Irom below rushed on deck with the news
that the ship was filling. Tbere was a
great hole in the ship's bow. "Clear away
the lifeboats!" rang out from the bridge
and was carried along the de<ks as the
magnificent vessel careened to one side and
settled by the head. While the men were
scrambling over the sides into the life
boats and the officers were still at their
posts on the bridge or deck the Royal Sov
ereign gave a lurch and went down by the
head. StruXglin men. floating wreckage
and a sea of troubled waters was all that
was Jeft of the mighty aeversary.
Should the little fighter lire all her five
torpedoes and not hit her opponent >he
ttill has her ram or armored turret with
which to tight. This turret is shaped like
an inverted boat on the vessel's back,
with a cutwater fore aiwi aft. The armor
is 4 inches in thickness and the turret is
9 feet long, 3 feet 10}Â£ inches in widih and
â 1 feet high. This steel point may be
jam me I into the unprotected hull of a
vessel with disastrous effect Craft of this
kind can live where no other kind of
vessel dare show its nose â in the line of fire
between two hostile fleets. She could
cross the hre-swep: zone with no;hing but
her observation mirror above water and
attack the opposition while the big fellows
were too busy peppering one another to
waste time looking for a piece of pipe
sticking above the water.
Should the enemy entrench itself in
one of our harbors and protect itself by
laying an outer iineof anchored torpedoes
or submarine mines, this little wonder
would be used to find the obstructions
and blow them up. She may also be of
inestimable value in carrying messages
through hostile lines, for if she is at
tacked she jimply has to sink herself and
pass under the enemy. She can lay in a
channel leading to a seaport and defy any
invaders io pass over her. Aud if some
old hulks of vessels were sunk in a chan
nel to prevent the United States warships
from relieving a besieged city, the sub
marine could stenl in under the water and
blow the obstructions to smithereens.
The radius of action of this manufactured
fish is 1000 miles on the surface and 60
miles under water.
It will be remembered that the Monitor
burst upon the world as a realization akin
to the marvelous. In an hour the existing
navies of mankind passed away as a breath.
In the face of the new craft, taking its
success for granted, the monster steel-clad
battle-ship is as helpless as the improvised
iron-ciad was before the "cheese-box on a
shingle." It will be remembered against
what a head of opposition the creation of
Encksson'B -. enius had to fight its way.
The battle with the Merrimac was but play
in comparison to it.
I n addition to being able to dive like a
porpoise while running, the craft can be
sunk wh le she is at a standstill. This is
accomplished by admitting water to the
ballast tanKs which cover the bottom of
the vessei, which will nearly overcome ncr
buoyancy. Then screws on top of the bow
and the stern, revolving horizontally, will
drive the little fighter to the bed of the
waters. When on the bottom a mush
room anchor will be lowered from the
bow and fasten itself in the earth, thus
holding the craft to ihe bottom.
There are two methods of escape in case
the vessel goes to ttÂ» bottom through ac
cident and refuses to rise again. In the
huli of the vessel and exposed to the pres
sure of the sea is a sensitive diaphragm. If
the craft sinks too deep the increased den
sity of the sea forces the diaphragm in
ward and it moves a piston-rod. This rod
opens a valve in a water-tank, when pneu
matic pressure will force out a quantity of
water ballast; air will take its place and
the craft will be forced to rise to the our
face. Should this method of escape fail
each member of the crew will dress in the
regulation diver's suit, the hull will be al
lowed to gradually fill with water, a hatch
will be opened and the men will be carried
to the surface by the buoyancy of the
suits.
The craft is to carry sufficient provisions
to remain on the bottom for three days,
and she cau also lie submergea for three
dsys without the necessity of coming up
for air. To accomplish the latter a coil of
hose attached to a flo tter is released, when
it will rise to the surface. Air is then
pumped down through the hose and
stored in tanks. The vessel has been con
structed to withstand the pressure at a
depth of eighty feet. She has frames t%
by 3% inches in thicKneas and the stvel
plaies on the hull frames are a half inch
thick. It is well known that a submarine
b?at must be a sensitive vessel. A man
walking about their interiors often affects
their trim. When a torpedo is fired irom
this craft a corresponding amount of
water will be admitted to the vessel to
equalize matters, and all fuel consumed
will also be compensated for. Further de
tails of the craft are explained by the ac
companying cut.
Submarine boats which did not po3sess
one-tenth of the qualities of this fighter
have sunk ships. David Bushneli, an
American, tried one on the 64-gun vessel
Eagle, belonging to the British, while she
was in New York Bay. The crtft dove
under the hull of the big fighter well
enough, but the attempt to screw the tor
pedo to the warship's hull failed, because
the effort drove back the sensitive sub
merged boat. When the attack was re
newed the Eagle had moved away. Rob
ert FuHop, the distinguished American
inventor, traveled under the harbor of
Brest, France, for hours, and offered to
"deliver France and the whole world
from British oppression" if Napoleon
would only give him a chance ai toe Eng
lish three-deckers. Napoleon let the
American experiment on au old veÂ»sel
and he promptly blew it up, but the Cor-
Bican gave him ho further encourage
ment. Then Fuiton went over to the
enemy, offering hi? boat to the British,
but Prime Minister Pitt, it is said, refused
to adopt a mode of warfare which might
rob England ol her supremacy of the seas.
FEDERAL APPOIN I MENTS.
California's Republican Difogation in Con
gress Will Make a Number of
Recommendations.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 7.â The
California Republican delegation in Con
gress held a protracted meeting to-day at
the rooms of Senator Perkins in the
Maltby building, one of the Senate an
nexes, to further consider recommend*-
lions for Federal appointments. Thera
were present Senator Perkins and Repre
senta;ivas Loud, Birham and Hilborn.
The only other Californian preseni was
Major Frank McLaughlin, chairman of
tho Republican State Central Committee.
The Â«ession lasted from 10 o'clock till 3
in the afternoon.
A vast number of applications were
piled up on the table, but the net result
of the conference, according to one of
those who was present, may be sum
in ir. zed thus:
The de.egaiion decided to iudorse Frank
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 8, 1897.
A. Leach of Oakland for superintendent
of the Mint at San Francisco, Julius
Jacobs for sub-treasurer, Cnptain Will am
L. M^rry for United States Minister to the
Greater Republic of Central America
(Nicaragua. Costa Rioaaml San Salvador),
Romualdo Pacbeco for Minister to Brazil,
Irving B. Dudley of San Diego for Min
ister to the Hawaiian Republic, Frank
Coombs for Minister to Japan (the post
formerly held by him), W. Ragsdale of
s Una Rosa as Consul to Hongkong,
Colonel Ellis of Alameda as Consul to
Yokohama and M. H. de Young as Minis
ter to Itnly.
It is the understanding that John P.
Jackson will be indorsed lor Collector of
the Port of San Francisco, although Joe
Spear is here on the ground and is making
a i.ard light for the place. It is under-
stood also that Senator Perkins favors
Jackson, as heretofore wired The Call.
Mr. Spear's friends say that the tight is
between these two men, but it is apparent
that Spear is losing hope.
There is a long list of candidates for
Collector of Internal Revenue. This ap
pointment is the most perplexing of all
and will he left to a future meeting of the
delegation for settlement. Neither the
Pan Francisco postmastersbip nor the
Pension agency were considered at to
day's meeting, the incumbents of these
offices having a year or more to serve.
It seems to be conceded that Colonel
Harrison Gray Otis, editor of the Los An
geles Times, will be appointed Assistant
Secretary of War. The Colonel is making
no effort to secure the appointment, for,
as Major McLaughlin said to The Call
correspondent to-night, "this seems to be
a case of the office seeking the man."
Colonel Otis' appointment will seriously
interfere with tue aspirations of two other
Caliornians of lesser note. These are
Stephen \V. Mosher of Del Rosa and How
ard Kutchin of the San Dieeo Tribune,
each of whom wants to be Fourth Assis
tant Postmaster-General. This is an im
portant position, for the Fourth Assistant
appoints all of the fourth-ciass postmas
ters. It is understood that Mr.Kuichin
relied upon (Senator Perkins and Senator
Spopner of Wisconsin to help him. but he
realizes that if Colonel Otis is appointed
Assistant Secretary of War his chances
will be slender. Mr. Mosher is willing to
accept a position of lesser importance.
The Call correspondent was reliably in
formed to-day that Frank P. Flint of
Pasadena will ba recommended by the
delesation for appointment as United
States District Attorney to succeed George
Denis, and that A. W. Francisco will be
made Collector of the Port at Ban Pedro.
The delegation has also decided to ask the
President to appoint Choplain Ames (now
at ban Quentin) as chaplain in the United
States army.
It seems to be the general impression
here that Colonel John P. Irish will be al
lowed to hold on to the naval office in con
sideration of the valuable service he ren
dered the Republican party in the late
campaign. Senator Perkins will try and
get this place for "Billy" Hamilton, but
the latter may have to apply for some
thing else.
The delegation, including Major Mc-
Laughlin, Colonel Otis and Mr. Hamilton',
will call upon the President to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock. Later in the day
Senators Perkins and White and Colonel
Otis will see the President in the interest
of Judge De Haven for United States
Judge. It is the general impression that
Judge McKenna will favor United States
District Judge W. W. Morrow for the cir
cuit bench, and tuat President McKinley
will be asked to nominate De Haven for
District Judge.
Colonel H. I. Kowaiski is here, but if he
is a candidate for any office he has Kept ii
quiet. Major McLaughiin, Judge De
Haven and.Mr.|Ham:lton are at Willard's;
Joe Spear is ut the Shoreham, George
Stone is at the Congressional, Colonel Oils
is stopping with his brother on I street
and Mr. Kowaiski is at the Arlington.
The Call correspondent was told to
night that ex Representative W. W. Bow
ers will probably De appointed Collector of
the Port of San Diego.'
Major McLauehlin adheres rigidly to his
determination not to apply lor any offi ce
nor to accept any. He believes tnat the
appointment of Julius Jacobs as Sub-
Treasurer will greatly please the Hebrew
people of California.
At to-day's meeting of the delegation
Major McLaughlin urged that prompt
action oe taken, and tnat ail of the
appointments be tilled as soon as possible
so that the applicants will no' ba kept in a
state of suspense. Major McLaughlin as
well as others who were present at the
caucus to-day declared that all of the rec
ommendations made will be from the
standpoint of party welfare rather than
individual preference.

STRIKING AGAINST CUT WAGES.
Between Three and Four Thousand Men
Are Expected to Go Out at
Chicago To- Day.
CHICAGO, 111., March 7.â To-morrow
morning a strike involving between 3000
and 4000 men will be inaugurated in this
city. Nearly 1500 piasterers and hod
carriers, who had been ordered to strike
at the close of work yesterday, have quit
with a determination not to return to
work until the old wage scale is restored.
To-morrow it is expected that many of
the all;, d trades will sustain the men in a
general strike to ficht the wage cut, and it
is argued by labor leaders that the em
ployers will not attempt to resist a com
bined movement and will retract their
demands for a cut in wages. It was
thought that the movement mieht be op
posed at a general meeting of the Chicago
Federation of Labor held this afternoon,
but no action was taken in regard to the
strike beyond tnÂ» passage of resolutions
expressing sympathy with the strikers.
Meetings were held last night by the
striking plasterers and the hod-carriers'
council, and the action taken by the exe
cutive board in ordering the strike in
dorsed. The electrical mechanics and
bicycle workers have pledged their sup
port to the strfkers, ns has also the Car
psnters' District Council. Concessions
have already been made by employers in
several; cases, and the work on certain;
contracts will be continued to-morrow.
Some Vhink thai a settlement will be
speedily made.

of the winter. A serious blockade is on in
South Dakota. No trains have been mov
ing to Wntertown, Huron, Milbank and
other points for the past twenty-four
hours. Members of the South Dakota
Legislatuie, which adjourned at Pierre on
Friday, have been unable to leave that
place owing to the blockade. General
Superintendent Russell Harding of the
Great Northern has just come in from
North Dakota and says:
"I think I would be very conservative
indeed to estimate the snow as being three
feet on the level of the plains. It is prob
ably nearer four feet on the level, and
telegrams received this afternoon indicate
another snowstorm."
Asked concerning the snow in the
mountains Mr. H irding said it had sur
passed ail previous records. In many
places it was far over the tops of the
telegraph-poles and so deep that the
rotary plows could do little better than
cut a tunnel rather than a swath. There
is so much snow on the ground that there
is grave fears of floods both in the Missis
sippi and Red River valleys. Everything
depends on the temperature of the next,
ten days.

city. It was known that the call to arms
addressed to Greeks would be read at the
services. At the hour for the services the
priest read the message of Krouzes, Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, as follows:
Reserves belonging to classes of 1866, 1867,
1868. 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872 and 1873 are
called to their standards. The only ones ex

within your jurisdiction to present them

Greek Consular authorities in the United
States. Recommend them to induce the re
serves to return to Greece.
Minister Botassi has issued a proclama
tion to his fellaw-countrymen and it has
been posted everywhere that Greeks are
likely to bee it. It is as follows:
In the name of King George I wish to offi
cially notify all the reserves of the Grecian
army who are in this country that their
fatherland calls them back to its ranks. And
to all Greeks, whether they have fought in by
gone days or whether they have not, I say, in
the name of my king, " Your country needs
you."
PHILADELPHIA. Pa., March 7.â A
company of Greeks assembled to-day and
earnestly talked over the situation. Every
one agreed that King George had adopted
the proper course. Many Greeks were
eager to go back and join the army, bui
most of the men in the classes referred to
are unable to pay their passage. When
the official order from the Greek Foreign
Minister wa9 received here a meeting of
the Greeks was called to devise ways and
means by which those whose presence in
Greece is compulsory can be sent back.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 7.â The Grecian
Vice-Consul in this c.ty announces that

From the Atlantic to the Pacific the
Greek residents of this continent are in
spired by one all-powerful desire, and that
is to respond without delay to their coun
try's appeal for the assistance of her sons
whether at home or abroad.
Nowhere, perhaps, are the Greeks more
eager to obey the call than in this City,
though as stated in yesterday's issue a
dearth of ready money prevents the ma
jority from immediately returning to their
native land. But the leading members
of the colony, in the persons of M. D.
Vanvales, f. Vrettos, Demetrak, Damiara
kis, Fundas, the brothers Demetriadis and
Kosta, as well as the Hellenic Society as a
whole, are determined to overcome this
seeming obstacle with as little delay as
possible, and the fact that yesterday was
Sunday did not deter them Irom taking
energetic action.
Early in the afternoon Messrs. Vrettos
and Fundas called upon August Gous
tiaux, the acting Greek Consul at this
port, and after a brief consultation between
these gentlemen it was determined tocom
municate with Hon. D. N. Botassi, the
Greek Consul-General at New York, and
inform him of the situa;ion in tiiis City.
Vrettos, who is a member of the Grecian
army reserve and a recognized leader of
the local patriotic movement, stated au
thoritatively that, in the event of trans
portation being provided, at least 150 0/
his countrymen in San Francisco would
j in the recruits who are hastening to New
York from all parts of the United States.
Acting Consul Goustiaux fully coincided
with the suggestions of Vrettos and Fun
da^, and ten minutes later the following
laconic but significant message was speed
ing along the wires to the Consul-General
at New York: ,
Hon. D. A". Bottassi, Greek Consul-General, New
York: About 150 Greeks intend to leturn.
â \Ynat do yoli advise?
Augcst Goustiaux, Acting Consul.
Vrettos feels confident that the Consul-
General will lose no time in arranging
with the railway companies to transport
the recruits to New York at special rates,
and that it sufficient funds cannot be
raised locally the home Government will
see fit to defray part at least of the ex
pense. If the assistance of the Greeks in
this country i 3 worth having at ali it is
certainly worth paying for, and there is
no logical reason to doubt that the home
Government is prepared for a contingency
of this nature.
The excitement among the Greeks in
this City is now raised to fever heat.
Vrettos, himself a man of massive propor
tions, weighing 265 pounds, and like most
persons of his avoirdupois ordinarily
rather phlegmatic, found it difficult to
express his feelings.
"Already," said he, "the Greeks in
New York have started to leave for
Greece and we chafe at the unavoidable
delay here. The Greek paper, Atlantis,
helped to defray the cost of transporta
tion by raising a special fund of $1000.
Unfortunately our countrymen here are
comparatively poor and we are likely to
experience some difficulty in paying for
our own Dassage. But lam satisfied that
the Consul-General w:ll act immediately,
because the number of recruits available
all over the West will certainly make it
worth his while to do so. We were pretty
well excited before, but a direct appeal
from our king has aroused us to a pitch of
enthusiasm which no temporary difficul
ties can quell."
Acting Consul Gonstiaux bag occupied
that position since 1894, when the former
Consul, Paviides. left San Francisco. Mr.
Goustiaux is a Frenchman by birth, but
is none the less ardently in symDathy
with the cause of the Greek and Cretan
patriots.
"I have just been reading The Call,"
he said yesterday, "and am greatly inter
este i in the news that the Consul-General
is communicating with the Greek Consuls
in every part of America. As yet, how
ever, I have not received any instructions
from headquarter--.
''NfC^sxarily, lam strongly in sympathy
with the Greeks in their projected strug
gle against Turkey and would like to see

ago I believed that this laudable ambuioa
was on the point of realization, but then
as now the great powers of Europe de
clared an ultimatum and Greece was com
pelled to submit. At the same time it yÂ»
quits evident that the people themselves^
in every part of Europe would welcome '
the union of Greece and Crete.
"The various governments, however,
find themselves in an awkward position.
Should war ensue and the Turks be
driven from Europe, an attempt will
doubtless be made by oue or other of the
powers to seize a nortion if not all of Tur
key f<Â» itself. Now if the powers as
a whole do not protest again3t a war
which bids fair to hasten the parti
tion of Turkey, they can haidly ioifi
ally protest at a future stage of th;
game. They must put themselves
on record so to speak. So they now
feel called upon to protest against the
projected annexation of Crete by Gresce.
Perhaps, too, it is feared that the annexa
tion of Crete wouid indirectly tend to con
firm the English occupation of Egypt,
which at present is tacitly agreed to by
the powers.
"Of course these are merely my own
individual opinions. I have no other
sources of information than the general
public who read the daily papers."
Mr. Goustiaux is now awaiting a reply
to his telecram, which should ba acknowl
edged at an early date, though it will not
i>e possible for the Consul-Geueral to
make the necessary arrangements for
transportation without some little delay.
The Hellenic Society will hold an emer
gency meeting on Wednesday evening to
discuss the situution and contrive ways
and means to supplement if necessary the
action oi the authorities.

Hearst's Long Green and His
Gang Must Produce Private
Telegraph Messages.
â *
Employes of the San Francisco "New
Journal" Scavenger Will Be Exposed
Before the Bribery Investi
gating Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 7.â Ever
since being ieft without a foot to stand
upon in its charges of wholesale bribery
against the members of the Legislature,
the Examiner, through its tnuravirate
of attorneys, has been howling for the
t -ociuction of telegrams, "in the tele-
J{ praph oflice," said its 'knightly' advocate
to the committee, "you will find a mine
of information. In the messages filed
with the West m Union and the Postal
Telegraph companies, gentlemen, you
will find food for refaction and matter
that will make interesting reading."
Everybody, of course, understood that
this was only one of the gentleman's elo
quent Dluffs, delivered with a simulation
of impassioned vehemence that took noth
ing from the attorney's reputation as an
orator.
No one expected that either committee
would give any serious consideration to ,
the proposition, and the issuance of the
drag-net subpena yesterday by the chair- i
man of the Senate committee was as much
a surprise to the Examiner people as it
was to the general public.
But having once departed from the well
established Jaw in reference to such mat
ters, the committee deemed it only rieht
to be consistent, and to-day issued an
other subpena on Superintendent Jaynes
of the Western Union Telegranh Com- !
pany, which is, however, it is only fair to
state, more within the spirit and letter of
the law than that demanded by and
granted to ihe Examiner's attorneys. It
reads as follows:
Senate Chamber, Sackamento, Cal.,)
March 7. 1897. \
To Frank Jaynes, Superintendent Western
Union Telegraph Company, San Francisco, Cal. :
You are hereby directed and commanded to
be and appear before the Senate committee
appointed by the resolution of tbe Senate of
the State of O.li'ornia, on Monday, the Ist
day of March, 1397, and which committee was
appointed and directed to investigate into the
charges made by the San Francisco Examiner
in its' issue of February "7, 1897, In regard to
bribery of members of the Senate in relation
to Asit mbl;- bill 273, on Mondny, the Bth day
pf Me.rcli, 1897, at 10 o'clock a. M, in room
I<> of the Capitol building at Sacra
mento for the purpose of giving
testimony la the matter of the investi
gation above referred to aud affecting the
contents of thnt certain article printed and
p :b'.i.=hed on the 27th day of February, 1897,
ie the S -n Francisco Daily Examiner, a daily
newspaper printed and published in the City
and County of San Francisco. State of Califor
nia, and which said article was and is headed
"Bribery in Aid of Thievery," and you are also
directed and required to bring with you and
have at the said time and piece and to present
to the said committee all telegrams in your
possession or under your control that have
been sent to or received by or sent by W. R.
Hearst, L. L. Levings, I. Alexander, A. M. Law
rence. Al Murphy or Franklin Hichborn, or
either of them, between the 11th day of Feb
ruary, 1897, aud the 7th day of March, 1897,
referring in any manner to Assembly bill No.
273, or to the article ia the Examiuer above
referred to, or to the present investigation
being heid under the resolution aforesaid.
Witness, my hand as chairman of said com
mittee, and this subpena is issued in pur
suance of an order of said committee at Sacra
mento this 7th day of March, A. D. 1897.
J. H. Dickinson, Chairman.
This document, it will be observed, calls
for the telegrams between the persons
named for a period of only twenty-four
days, whereas t^e subpenas issued on the
request of the Examiner's attorneys ask<
that telegrams D 3 produced for a period
covering sixty days.
Service was made on Superintendent
Jaynes by telegraph, as was done in the
case of the other.
It is hoped by means of this subpena to
obtain the information, if there is any in
existence, on which was based the article
in the Examiner of February 27, without
involving any one connected with the
Exaoiner in a breach of confidence or a
violation ot his word of honor. If inci
dentally these messajres should confirm
the now generally accepted opinion, that
kthe charges of bribery emanated in the
;'in-cocktail befuddled brain of one of the
attaches of the faking scavenger journal,
as was intimated by Attorney Knight, or
reveal the fact that it was a deliberate
falsehood published for some ulterior mo
tive, that would be the misfo une of the
Examiner, for he who fakes uould keep
nway from the **mine of information," so
that he may live to fake another day.

Lawrence in regard to the publication of said
article, through Senator Morenotise, feting as
counsel for the Senate, propounded the
following questions and the following an

place as herein stated. Your committee,
Through Senator Morehouse, propounded to
ssia A. M. Lnwrence the fo. lowing questions:

Question by Senator Morehouseâ Where is
that writing now? Which question was ob
jected to, n:id the chairman oi tne committee
! directed the witness to answer, which he de
! ciined to do; thereupon Senator Morehouse
' propounded the following question: "Where
,is the writing now!" A.â l have not the re
â  inotest idea.
I Questionâ What did you do with itT An
swerâl destroyed it or threw it away.
' Q.â How did you destroy that, Mr. Law
i re nee? A.â l decline to answer.
Q âThe contents of the writing, did it or did
it not have relation to the suoject maper of
! the tfrticie printed in the Sun Francisco Daily
Examiner last Saturday headed "Bribery in
] Aid of Thievery"? which question the witness
' declined to answer. Thereupon Senator More
i house asked the witness whai was the con
-1 tents of the writing which he had destroyed or
! thrown away, and the witness declined to
answer the question or to give any infor
i mation o: tlie contents of the paper or
document which he had destroyed or thrown
I away or ihe source irom which he derived
it, and your committee report that as
[ ihe San Francisco Daily Exs miner has made
' the charges set forth in the article hereinbefore
; referred to, and was supposed to have and are
: presumed to have the information in their
i possession upon which the article is based,
and that it cannot proceed further with the
exnniination of said witness un:il the further
'â  action of this Senate in their belialf.
And upon the said examination of witnesses
iso held as aforesaid, on the sth day of
\ March, 1897, said witness, Al Murphy, was
. placed u^on tue witness-stand, and, after
! being duly sworn, he testified that he was
' connected with the ban Francisco Daily Ex
â  aminer, and a correspondent ior that paper.
Among other things, the following proceedings
were had :
| Question or Sena'or Morehouseâ Do you
I know ot your own kuowledge of any cominu
-1 mention irom the city of SHcramento to any
person connected witn the Examiner either on
â  last Saturday or two weeks or ten days prior
to that time? Witnessâ Of any personally?
Senator Seawallâ Yes. \N itness â Would that
include iuysell?
Q.â lf you sent any communication to the
â¢ Examiner? A.â Of any communication that I
i might have seen? I do not think I can answer
â  that question unless Mr. Hearst consents to
I my doing so.

i by any person connected with the Examiner
! which" you know of your own knowledge to
; have bJen forwarded to that paper concerning
I the subject matter in question? A.â l shall
| have to decline to answer that question for
! tha same reason Riven. Ido not desire to be
I in contempt of the committee, but I shall have
! to decline to answer :he question under these
circumstances.
Senator Seawellâ l understand that you re
fuse to answer unless released by the manager.
A.â Tn;it is it, Senator.
Mr. Chairmanâ The ruling is made upon the
question submitted. Witnessâ l refuse to au
swer that.
Mr. Chairmanâ That is not the question.
Senator Morehouseâ The only purpose of the
question is to find out who furnished the in
lormatiun. that is all.
Mr. McEnerneyâ We have stated our posi
tion in the matter and will adhere to It.
Senator Morehouseâ l will asx you, Mr.
Murphy, if you iti>ew who was the author of
tlie article headed "Bribery in Aid of Thiev
ery," published in the San Francisco Exam
iner? A.â l do not know absolutely. 1 can
guess, but I do not know absolutely. I can
tell more or less by the style of the article. I
tliiaK 1 know, but I could not say positively.
Ana your committee reports that it will be
thus seen that your committee cannot proceed
further with the examination ot' snid witness
for the reason that he, the said witness, the
same as the said A. M. Lawrence, refuses to
answer questions pertinent to the issu-j or to
furnish toy oiircomitiittee information claimed
to be in the possession of the San Francisco
Examiner.
And on the said sth day of March, 1897, at
the time and place aforesaid, your committee
had belore it as a witness L. L. Levings, also n
reporter and curresiiondent of the San Fran
cisco Daily Examiner, and lifter he was duly
sworn end testified as to his relation to the
San Franc-isco jjaily Examiner, the following
occurred during the course of said examina
tion :
Question by Senator MorehouÃeâ Do you
know of your own knowledge of any telegram
sent by any member of the Senate or received
by any member of the Senate to influence his
vote for or azainst or to withhold nis vote on
Assembly bill 273? A.â l shall decline to
answer mid wish to explain.
Mr. Chairmanâ >tate your reasons. I sug
gest that y>u answer the question.
Senator Morehouseâ Why do you decline to
answer? A.â Because should it be within my
knowledge "f any telegram having passed be
tween members of the Senate and persons out
side relative to this matter, and 1 should be
required to answer as to my knowledge, I
would be violating the confidence that would
not only ruin me as a newspaper man, but
would be giving away Information that be
longs to my employers, which my employers
pay .'or, and which is their property and not
mine.
Mr. Chairmanâ lt Is the sense of the com
mittee that the explanation is not sufficient,
the question will be repeated to him, and
tliereupon the reporter repeated the question
aforeNÂ«id, and lho witness said: "I ask per
mission to have time to answer, and would
like <o make further explanation in order that
t lie committee m*y not think lam acting ar
bitrarily." The question was thereupon re
peated to the witness, and the witness an
swered, "I uec'iiie to answer."
And your committee hereby reports that it
trill be seen that the more said witnesses, all
of whora are connected with the San Fran
cisco Examiner, refuse and decline to answer
the questions propounued to tuem relative to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 8, 1897.
the subject matter contained In the said
article so published in the San Francisco
Daily Examiner or to Rive this committee any
informtttion in their possession concerning or
relatlne to the vote of tlie Senators on As
sembly bill 273 or relating to the charge of
bribery ramie in the said article so published
in the "said San Francisco Daily Ext.miner on
the morning of the 27th day of February,
1897.
And your committee begs leave to report
that in their opinion the said witnesses are
guilty of con tempt of this Sennte, and by their
refusal to obey the orders of this Senate or to
answer questions propounded to them relevant
to the issue of such investigation are guilty of
contemnt of this Senate, and resp-ctfully re
quests mat the Sergeant-at-Arms of tliis
Senate be authorised and empowered to sub
pena the said witnesses and that they be
brought before the bar of the. Senate and that
your committee, through its counsel, Senator
Morehouse, be permitted to propound the said
questions which they, the said witnesses, have
heretofore refused to answer, and that the
said witnesses Le examined at such time as
may be designated by resolution ot this Sen
ate, and upon the failure of the said witnesses
:o answer the said questions tnat the said wit
nesses be adjudged guilty of contempt of this
Semite end that they be punished in such
manner as the Senato by resolution may
direct.
Immediately upon the adoption of the
foregoing report a resolution citing the re
calcitrant witnesses before the bar of the
Senate for contempt will be introduced.
This resolution will give the witnesses the
opportunity to purge themselves and the
right to counsel, and the attorneys will be
allowed to argua the matter, for half an
hour.
Should the Senate rind them fruilty of
contempt a resoiution will be at once sub
mitted prescribing the punishment tor
the witnesses. It is probable that in place
of the Senate beinc Rsketl to s-end them at
once to jail, as was at lira? thought would
be done, a line of $500 will be im posed on
each witness, with the alternative of 250
days' imprisonment in the County Jail.
It is wcjl known that the Examiner's
policy is to place every possible obstruc
tion in the way of the investigation com
mittee, in the hope that the investigation
will drag on until the day of adjournment
sine die, and that tlie mailer will then be
dropped. Such a contingency has oeen
anticipated by the committee, and should
ihe investigation not be completed when
the Legislature concludes its present ses
sion a special Lexow committee will be
appointed by the Seuate of holdover Sen
ators to conciude the investigation and
remain in existence until the next Legis
lature meets.
Tbis move will also keep any recalci
trant witnesses, who may be sentenced to
imprisonment, in jail until they have
served me sentence imposed by the in
vestigation committfe oi the Senate.

So Far Nothing Lomem Out of the Print-
1117 Invmtlgafiotl.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 7.â The
joint committee on investigation into the
affairs of the State Printer broke Sunday
by remaining in session the whole day
and part of the evening.
Nothing was discovered that tsnded to
show that State Primer Johnston had been
derelict as a State official, and he ex
plained how the apparent deficiency came
about. He said that in the forty-seventh
fiscal year he paid deficiencies of the forty
sixth fiscal year. The items wore: Legis
lative printing, forty-sixth fiscal year,
$J8,U03; permanent material, $6950; re
pairs, printing, etc., $5048; stock, $15,698;
insurance, $1342;; remainder, $2136. He
had always considered as applying to
waces paid in changing the bindery.
Dickinson pointed out that the alleged
deficiency as statÂ»d in the Governor's
mesxaee was $51,293, and for the stock
$12,000, the adued total would be $63,079.
HÂ«* wanted to know how that happened.
Johnston replied tuat it wou.d not
make any difference whether he made
arbitrary charges or not. His accounts
balanced perfectly with the Controller's.
His books fhowed in detail the work done
and its cost.
Caminetti wanted to know how Johns
ton could account for me alleged de
ficiency of $2130 in his report and in his
subsequent account.
Johnston replied that $3000 was the
estimated cost of moving the bindery and
the composing-rooms. He kept no record
of orders, but they came back in the
formed bills. The charges against the
iieni of legislative printing are the cost of
the work. He could not be exact as to
the arbitrary charges in his report. His
books would show the real amount. All
the stocK used in legislative printing was
not legislative stcck.
Senator Gillette evidently became tired
of the pecking of (Jaminetti at little
things and suggested that tlie serious
charge made by tne Governor as to a
shortage of $50,000 should be examined
into.
"If there is anything wrong," he said,
"let it be exposed. It looks as if some
body wanted to make political capital out
of it."
The Senator added that ono of the mem
bers of the committee had acted as if he
were prosecuting attorney, Senator Sea
well had admitted that
Caminetti hotly denied that he was
prosecutor. Seawell had designated him
as a prosecutor, but that was through
force of habit. He was ready to go as lar
as anyone in vindicating Johnston.
Senator Seawell said that he had not
meant to designate Caminetti as a prose
cutor or as biased against Johnston in any
way.
Price called attention to the fact that
Senator Seawell had frequently spoken of
party votes. Caminetti was fortified witli
forty or fifty typewritten questions, ana
he had a tabulated statement which he
had tried to force into the report for the
purpose of making political thunder.
Cuminetli rattier hotly replied that no
one could impugn his motives. He would
rise up on the floor of the House and re
sign if such charges were to be ;ontinued
against him. Ho denied that he said to
Senator Gillette that he had Johnston on
the gridiron to-night ana that he would
have him again to-morrow. It wan his
duty to inquire about the $50,000 dis
crepancy.
Senator Gillette remarked that it was
not the duty of a Judge to go around talk
ing about people wl>o were to be tried be
fore him. Caminetti dec ared he would
resign from the committee, and Price ex
pressed his willingness to kiss and make
up, but t!ie rii'ry man from Amador re
plied that he would neither be kissed nor
cajoled.
\V. 11. Taylor, who worked in the State
printing office several years ago, informed
the committee as to the routine work of
the office. He was asked whether lie had
not I.een appointed to the office at the in
stance of Frank Ilhoads, the political
boss of Sacramento, but he had been ap
pointed by Johnston hims-lf. He had
known of men being laid off for the pur
poso of attending primary elections.
Dickinson asked the witness concerning
certain statements he (Taylor) hnd made
in his report, to the Governor. Taylor re
plied that those statements were made on
hearsay, and were not authentic or offi
cial. This -witness made a very poor im
pression on the committee, and his own
statements shattered the v;ilu9 of the
slipshod report made by him to the Gov
ernor.
"Do you think that Johnston is as com
petent"a State Printer as any of his prede
cessors?" asked Dennery.
"I decline to answer that question un
less I am forced to do so," replied the
witness.
At 10:45 p. m. the committee adjourned
uulil3:3or. m. to-morrow.

LISTENS TO GRANT'S OLD PASTOR.
President Res's From the Week's Fa-
tigues and Attends the Methodist
Episcopal Church.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 7.âPresi
dent McKinley's first Sunday in the
White House was a quiet one. No callers
were received and the President had an
opportunity of Testing from the fatigues
of the week. He rose later than usual,
mr.cu refreshed from a hard day's work
on Saturday. Breakfast was served at 10
o'clock, after which he prepared for
churcn, and. accompanied by his mother,
attended services at the Methodist Episco
pal Church where President Grant was
accustomed to attend. As the President's
intention had been announced the crowd
was very large, and the President and his
venerable mother had considerable trouble
in makinc their way from the sidewalk to
the cSinrcfa vestibule.
The President was shown to what is
called the Presidential pew. The other
occupants Were hia mother, Abner Mc-
Kinley, his brother, and Private Secretary |
and Mrs. Porter.
Rev. Dr. Johnson, the pastor, formerly
of Canada, opened the services by prayer,
and the Rt. Rev. Bishop Newman of
Omaha, Neb., formerly the ;:is;or of the
church when General Grant was Presi
dent, preacbed the sermon. The sacred
ediiice was crowded, the aisles were all
tilled, and many could not gain admit
tance.
Bishop Newman took for hia text: "I
have not come to call the righteous, but
I sinners to repentance." From this text
tho preached an eloquent discourse. Good
laws, good government, knowledge and
I philanthropy, the pastor said, wer-* all
good, but would not be sufficient. "Sack
lirst the king torn of h'-aven," bo said, "is
the first and last principle of political
i economy."
When the distinguished party left the
church the crowd was so great that the
police iiad to clear the way. As President
McKinley passed with his mother on his
arm the crowd cheered and tne President
doffed his hat several times. Entering
the carriage the party drove at once to
the White House.
Mrs. McKinley, the President's wife,
was so fatigued that she could not attend
church with her husband.
Aff r returning to the executive man
sion the President remained quietly in
doors until after neon, when he took a
short walk with a friend, returning from
which he spent the remainder of tae day
with the members of his family.
Vice-President Hobart and wife at
tended services at the Church of the Cove
nant, the Rev. Dr. Hamlm preaching the
sermon; Secretary of War Ah r er, wife and
daughter, at the New York Avenue PreÂ«
byterinn Church, the Rev. Dr. Radcliffe

PORTLAND, Or., March 7.â Hon. H.
W. Corbett, who wa3 appointed United
States Senator by Governor Lord yester
day, to fill the vacancy caused by the ex
piration of John H. Mitchell's term, left
for Washington to-night, accompanied by
his wife. Regarding the possibility of his
not being seated Mr. Corbett said:
"I am advised that the precedents are
all in favor of seating an appointee, pro
vided the legislature is not in session when

unequivocal on this question. Ii seated,
I shall assist in carrying out the pledges
contained in tho St. Louis platform."
Atlnnr.tril Suicide at Fretno.
FRESNO, Cal., March 7.â Deputy Sheriff
F. c:cott, a brother of Sheriff Jay Scott,
made an unsuccessful attempt to commit
suicide this evening. He toolc a dose of
cocaine, but was discovered in time and
his life was saved. The deputy had been
drinking and was much the worse of
liquor. A few months ago he tried to end
his life by shutting himself up and turn
ing the gaa on in a juryroom at the court
house. He was drunk at that time also.
Tiie young officer makes hard attempts at
leaving the festiva bowl alone, but every
few months he yields. Then, when he
becomes drunk, lie feels the remorse so
deeply that it leads him to try to end his
existence.

BURIED UNDER
SLIDING SNOW
Four Miners at Park City
Crushed Beneath an
Avalanche.
Death Comes Upon Them Sud
denly as They Sleep in
Their Cabin.
The Fate of the Victims Almost
Shared by an Equil Number
of Their Companions.
SALT LAKE, Utah. March 7.â A dis
astrous snowslide swept down cany this
morning upon the works of the Daly mine
at Park City, burying eight men under its
crushing volume. Four of the men were
recovered ana resuscitated; the dead
bodies of three were dug out by the
miners, and one is not yet recoverod, al
though it is certain he is dead, as twelve
hours have elapsed since he was en*
tombed.
The names of the dendare: James W.
Keating, N. RusÂ«atto, Nicholas Paifin and
Joseph Zucca. Tne iatter's body has not
yet been lound. â¢ '
The four men who are alive were more
or less in jured, although they are litcely
to recover. Their names are: Thomas
Hodges, Harry Pinney, James Hallman
and Charles Mathison.
The eight men were asleep when the
avalanche struck their cabin, and carried
it and everything else in its path for hun
dreds of feet, until it reached the mill of
the Daly Mining Company, demolishing
the engines, boilers and doing damage to
the extent of probably $50,000.
The dead men were mineis and all had
families except Russatto. The bodies when
dug out were mangled almost beyond rec
ognition.
John Mackinaw had $5000 in greenbacks,
cold and notes in a trunk in the cabin
which was swept away, and crowds of peo
ple are digging in the hope of recovering
the money.
Half a dozen snowslides of smaller di
mensions have taken place at the Park
to-day, but none of them were attended
by fatal results. The mountains surround
ing the city are full of Bnow, in some
places to a depth of forty leer, and other
disasters are looked for, as the weather is
mild and thawing.
FIND A BABE IN THEIR CARRIAGE.
Rancher Bixby and Wife of Santa Ana
Come Into Possession of a
Foundling.
LOS ANGELES, Cxt,., March 7.â
Rancher George Bixby and wife of Orange
County had an experience yesterday even
ing which they will not soon forget.
They were in Santa Ana during the day,
and their shopping kept them in town
until between 8 and 9 o'clock in the even
ing. Their team was bitched across the
street from the county office, and their
surprise came when they bad gone to the
carriage to start home.
Mrs. Bixby heard a slieht noise under
the seat of the vehicle and upon reach
ing down felt a small bundle that evi
dently had some life about it. She called
her husband, and a hasty examination
was made. In tho dim liglu from the
stores a pretty, round-faced, plump boy
baby was discovered. The infant had a
new rubber nipple in its mouth and ap
peared to be in a rather stupefied condi
tion. It was well dressed â in fact, it was
in costly attire, and had the appearance
o: having been well cared for in every
way.
Alter the finders recovered somewhat
from the shock the officers were notified.
The infant was taken home by Mr. and
Mrs. Bixby and is being cared for. In
speaking of the case to-day Sheriff
Nichols said the child had apparently
been drugged when it was put into the
bugiiy, so that it would make no outcry,
it being the intention of the person
placing the babe there to have it lemain
(,uiet until Mr. and Mrs. Bixbv were well
onthflirway home. Neither the officers
nor Mr. and Mrs. Bixby have the slight
est clew as to the identity of the child,
p.s there was nothing about its clothes to
give an intimation as to its parentage.

RABBI LEVY AT STANFORD.
" How or Never" the Theme Upon Which
Hs Disccurses Before the
S udents.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 7. â R;ibbi Myer S. Levy of the
Congregation Bath-Israel of San Ftan
cisco delivered tne sermon in the chapel
to-day. Mrs. Stanford had been especially
anxious that the students should hear him.
Tne subject of his sermon was "Now or
Never." In substance the speaker said:
From remote ages men have asked "What
must we do to be snved ?" It is a question
which hns robbed youth of its pleasures and
old age of its pence. Since Asking mat ques
tion men huve steadily progressed.
Whatever the old theological ideas of the
hereafter we art- but little concerned. Eter
nal punishment is not the wish of ourUod, for
he is a Uod of love. He is merciim aud just;
he does not her malice forever.
I fully realize the value of prayer, but piety
a'one Is not sufficient to make v man success
ful in life. Hi- must have character. He is
hero to advance honestly. The oi. e who
wishes to succeed must realize that
he must do to live. Man's work is not futile.
The history of the world is but a history of the
earnest work of strong lives.
There is an old German proverb which was
found engraved upon a key ; "It I rest I rust."
t is not ease, but effort, that makes men.
Many hard-fought tattles must still be waged
before pertect ease is assured.
Our life is like a knleido.se opeâ it is forever
changing, and seems not twice alike. To suc
ceed we must have a goal always before us. A
defeat must no; dishearten us. It may be our
greatest victory if it spurns us on to decisive
action.
An ounce of "now" Is worth a ton of "later
ons." Tne most carefully plauned campaign
may meet with disaster, yet the impulsive,
haphazard onslaught carries the day. It is a
terrible calamity to believe in chance. Nature
abnors it and reason denounces it. Life must
be sober; it must be earnest. Don't be a giant
in thougnt and a dwarf in action. If we Â£0
our way n r (>mptly, doinÂ« our duty, be the
world's comment what it may. we shall be
masters ol the situation, nn<! failuresâ never.
HORSEWHIPS A PORTLAND MAN.
Miss Oyler of San Francisco Arrested
lor Chastising a Society
Lion.
PORTLAND, Or., March 7.â A young
woman calling herself Carrie Oyler, re
cently from San Francisco, where she
claims to be well connected, was arrested
late last night for cowhlding Frank Grif
fith, a nickei-in-the-slot machine agent, in
his room in the Multnomnh building.
Griffith poses as an irresistible man
anioiiL' the laities, and in one of Ins return
trips from the bay he brought Mi-s Oyler
with him. They were supposed to be mar
ried until the episode resulting in the
woman's arrest.
On Friday night she, accompanied by
Luke Kuvkendai. walked into Griffith's
room without the formality of rapping
at tne door, and without any preliminary
talk begrn to unmercifully belabor Grif
fith in the lace and over the head with a
rawhide. Alter a little struggle Griffith
succeeded in wrestine the woapou from
tiie woman.
Khe at once procured another she had in
reserve in the hallway and resumed opera
tions. This time Griffith was forced to
throw Miss Oyler upon a bed and choke
her before she surrendered her whip.
At this juncture young Kuykendal took
a hand In the fray b.v leveling a revolver
at Griffitn, threatening to shoot him if he
refused to allow the woman to depart iv
peace.
TMfl affair gained publicity to-day, and
as Griffith lias been quite a social lion
here his chastisement is the gossip of the
hour. He says that he would not have
caused Miss Oyler's arrest but for the fear
that she might attempt lo do him great
bodily harm. The woman claims to have
thrashed her erstwhile friend because he
spoke disrespectfully of her. The true
story of this affair may be disclosed in
court to-morrow. There is a warrant out
for the arrest of Kuykendal, who as yet is
under cover.

0 ficers and Civilians Fail to
Capture a Midnight
Robber.
After Taking a Citizen's Money Ho
Had Brutally Beaten His
Victim.
STOCKTON, Cai,.. March 7.â Andrew
Chidester was robbed at the point of a re
volver and then brutally beaten in the
principal residence portion of Stockton
shortly before last midnight. Chidester
was going to his home, and on the corner
of Park and San Joaquin streets was
stopped by a man who stepped out from
the shadows and commanded him to
throw up h;s hands. As the imperative
demand was enforced by the presence of a
revolver, Chidester complied. The man,
with his free hand, took a gold watch and
chain and received about $18 in change,
which Chidester poured into his itching
palm.
After asking if that was all, he quickly
drew back his hand and gave Chiaester an
upper-cut, landing on the chin, and bring
ing the Stocktonian to bis knees. The
thug then turned and ran west along Oak
street. Chidester was stunned, but re
covered himself quickly and gave chase.
He was gaining on the man, and at the
corner of Hunter perceived a crowd of
high school boys coming along, among
them Dick Tully and Walker |Bours.
! Chidester called to them to stop the thug.
The boys concluded that they would
have a little picnic, and started in with
the intention of tackling him football
fashion. The man kept straight west, and
as the boys started for him he tired one
shot into the air. The boys concluded it
was only a bluff and kept ahead, gaining
on the runner untii within about twenty
paces of him, when he whirled and fired
squarely at his pursuers The ball whis
tled by young Bours' bÂ»ad.
The young men decided that it was not
a proper time to rush or tackle and paused
for re-enforcements. They kept an eye on
the man, however, and observed him get
into the McDougall block.
Police Captain Simpson was at home
when the shots were fired, and believing
something wus wrong started in the direc
tion whence the reports came. He soon
came upon the Doys, and about the same
time officer Kuhn and Deputy Sheriff
Biack arrived in the pa'rol wagon. Thn
officers, assisted by Chidester and the
boys, beat the block so lively that their
game left his cover and was seen working
his way westward. After getting out of
range of the electric lights his escape was
made easy.

IN HIS SLEEP WHIPS CORBETT
Fifzsimmons Again Dreams
of Victory in the
Arena.
FIVE FIEKCELY FOUGHT
ROUNDS.
Graphic Description of the Mill
.. as He Saw It in the
Vision.
GEORGE GREEN HAS A NARROW
ESCAPE.
A Boat in Which He Was Rowing
Cap3izes and He Is Barely Say.d
From Drowning.
CARSON, Net., March 7. â Fitzsim
mons has had another dream, and as
usual has dreamed of victory. Bob con
fesses to a weakness for beholding visions
during the slumbers that precede all of
his big battles, and, while he protests that
he Is not superstitious, he holds that none
of his nightmares have ever given him
the wrong tip, and will tell you in a sort i
Scenes and Incidents Before the Big Fight at Carson
of half-donbtful way that there might be
something in these nocturnal prophecies
after all.
Fitzsimmons' new dream goes on rec
ord as having visited him last night. This
is not the first time the St. Patrick day's
battle has been pictured to him in bis
Bleep Bince the signing of the articles.
Tiiere was one ahead of this one, which
called on him several weeks ago, while he
â¢was still in the East. On that particular
occasion Bob saw Corbett curl up ami go
to sleep at the end of the seventh round.
In describing the vision at the time, he
said he saw a ring pitched in the open
air, with something like 20,000 people
gathered around.
He was the first of the two world's cham
pionship aspirants to enter the rin?, but
was compelled to wait quite a while, the
delay being caused by Corbett's refusal to
leave his dressing-room. The crowd
roared with anger, and threatened the
Californian with all sort 3of violence if he
persisted in remaining in seclusion, and
finally Corbett came out; the gloves were
produced, and the fight began.
As Fitzsimmons says he saw it in the
dream the fortunps of both varied during
the first six rounds, but the seventh saw
Corbett distressed. Bob saw his chance,
and cornering the Olympic Club idol he
sent a stiff left into his abdominal cavity.
This blow caused Corbett's head to come
forward, and Fitzsimmons in his vision
shot In a magnificent upper-cut and put
his man to sleepâ such an upper-cut, he
explained, as wound up Sailor Kharkey in
San Francisco.
It took the Cornishrcan seven rounds to
close the career of Gentleman Jim in that
Eastern dream, but Bob must be smoking
a better brand of the poppy extract of
late, for in last night's picture of the mill
he turned the trick in the fifth round.
The mammoth arena in which the ap
proaching battle is to be fought is close to
the road leading to Fitzsimmons' training
quarters, and in consequence he sees it
during his tramps into town almost daily.
This will account for the perfect picture of
the vast inclosure that he saw last night
while he snored.
Again was there a great and surging
crowd in attendance, and it was a noisy
assemblage at that. F'itzsimnions in tell
ing of the dream this afternoon said that
he emerged from his dressing-room en
veloped in las time-honored bath robe,
and followed by his seconds armed with
buckets, bottles and fans he met with an
ovation that i&ir'.y sh ok the place and
brought echo after echo rolling back from
the surrounding snowclad mountains.
Then when Corbett appeared there was
another roar, another fac-simile earth
quake and a duplication of the echoes.
"To tell the truth," said Filzsimmons,
scratching his head in an endeavor to re
call more of the details of the dream, "I
don't believe I can tell you which one of
us got the best of those receptions. Aa I
remember it now, everybody in the place
howled for me and then everybody yelled
for Gorbett. I gueÂ«s it was horse and
horse. We will let it go at that, any
how."
Then he went on to describe the battle.
But little time was lost in measuring dis
tances and getting acquainted with each
other's tactic 3, for both were anxious.
The air was row and cold, and before they
were in the ling ten seconds they were at
it. It was a fast and furious battle. Fitz
simmons opened the battle with a mur
derous swing, which, had it landed, would
have settled the battle; but Jim was on
the alert, ductced and came back at Fitz
siuimons with a sharp rap on the nose.
A clinch followed, but both escaped from
it without damage. Corbett's cleverness
and ability to dance out of harm's way
saved him several times during that
round, so dreamed Fitzsimmons, from
going down under the piledriver blows
that were sent after him. He was like a
shadow so far as locating him was con
cerned, but Fitzsimmons was persevering
and confident that he would land event
ually.
So the battle waged during four rounds
and the pace was plainly telling on Cor
bett,. He did not respond to the call of
time with that nimbleness that had char
acterized his previous appearance on the
scratch â and here the dream grows inter
esting.
Fitzsimmons saw his opportunity and
da-hel in to finish matters. He beat
down the champion's guard, and the
crowd, which had all along been noisy,
now simply roared, for tha end was in
sight.
"Good boy, Bob!" was what the Cor
nishman heard in his dream. And, as the
noise was dying away, a female voice
echoed shrilly with another "Good boy,
Bob!" Fhzsimmoiis knew that voice, for
it was Mrs. Fitzsimmons', and it had the
effect of redoubling his energies.
The battle was soon over. Corbett,
unaDle to beat off the attacks, dropped
his arms. A hush had come over the
20,000, but it was broken by a resounding
smash as Fitz-immons' right connected
with the champion's jaw, and â
"I'm the champion of the world!"
yelled Fitzsimmons.
"What in thunder is the matter with
you, now?" said Trainer Dan Hickey,
jumpin.r out of his warm bed and discov
ering Filzsimmon3 standing shivering in
the middle of the bedroom and waving nis
long arms like a marionette.
"Hang it all," said Fitzsimmons, as he
rubbed his eyes and looked about to see
where he was, "I thought the fight was
over, but it was only another of those con
founJed dreams."
Ever3 - Dody laughed uproariously wnen
Bob finished the story of his dream, and
the Cornishman joined in the chorus.
"Never mind, though," he said, when
he could make himself heard. "That will
ba the story of the battie just as sure as I
am standing here."
I was out to Coroett's training quarters
Late this afternoon and found that the
champion had heard about Fitzsimmons 1
dream.
'â¢Well," said Jim, with one of those
funny winks of his, "I am saiislied to let
him have all the enjoyment he can get
out ot those nightmares, lor they will
furnish about all the pleasure he will get
out of this litile engagement. That is
about as near as ho will ever get to whip
ping me â in his dreams."
It was then time for Corbett to begin his
afternoon training and as we waited over
to the handball court tofjetiier he snid :
"I'll tell you, my boy, there is only one
story to this right, or else I am the worst
guesser in the world. I will repeat now
what I have often said before and that is
that I consider myself to be in the best
physical condition I ever attained
throughont my athletic career. If condi
tion is to determine this coming battle I
have won already. But that is not the
point lam getting atâ not the story I re
lerred to. To my mind it is simply a
question as to whether or not Fiizsim
mons can land on my jaw that lucky
punch which has made him celebrated.
That's all there is to this tight. I don't
Delievc he can land it, but still nobody
can tellâ he might. If he does not it will
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 8, 1897.
be all day with him, for I know I can hit
him and I'll cut him to ribbons as sure as
I am talking to you now."
Corbett gave a remarkable exhibition of
endurance this afternoon, and thoso who
witnessed the performance went away
fully convinced that if i lie approaching
contesi develops into a prolonged affair
the Australian will in no wise be at a dis
advantage. He beuan his work by wrest
ling with his wrist machine. Now, this
apparatus is reputed to be capable of tir
ing a ue.son more than any of the muscle
making devices used by athletes, and any
one who has ever "fooled" with one of
them in a gymnasium knows this fact.
Corbett put in twenty-five minutes of
steady and vigorous work on the machine,
and then, as he was gloving his hands for
a bout with the bunctiing-bapr, gave me a
little dissertation on the effects of wrist
practice.
"When I get through with that ma
chine my arms and hands are apparently
worked out, so fatigued are they," he said.
"Anybody else who tackles it the way I
do will be affected in the same way, if not
worse. Bu; the funny part of it is that as
soon as I begin to thump the bag, which
i 3 the next work on the programme, that
feeling of fatigue begins to disappear, and
the lunger I punch the stronger I feel
until finally I am in the very finest of
fettle for the" handball games and boxing
bouts that follow the punching- bag exer
cise.
"The wrist machine is a wonderful help
to a man in training, for it gives great
strength to the forearms and hands, and
they are the most valuable weapons he
can have in a contest, and must bo care
fully prepared so as to lessen the danger
of tneir breaking.' 1
Jim was now ready for the bag, and at his
request 1 tent time for him. He began
with his left hand, vaiyiug between hooks,
straight-arms, swings and jabs, and asked
that he be notified when he had worked
five minutes. I purposely neglected to
sing out to him when the five minutes
were up, and the result was that he con
tinued to pump away with the left hand,
the ball beating a veritable tattoo as it
rattied against the ceiling with lightning
like rapidity.
"What's the time?" finally asked Cor
bett. but without missing a blow at the
bounding ball.
"Eighteen minutes."
"Humph, I was commencing to think
that was rather a Jong five minutes," he
said, emphasizing each word with a
whack at tne ball. "Well, that's all
right, 1 ' he continued, "we will make it
twenty minutes," and he did.
Then the right hand was brought into
play for ten minutes and this was followed
by a rattling finish with both handsâ
thirty-five minutes in all. I took partic
ular pains to notice the condition of the
big fellow at the close of this violent ex
ercise so thnt the readers of the Call
might be given an idea as to what a man
who is fit ior a championship battle ran
do. He was wet and steaming with
perspiration, but his breathing did not in
dicate in the slightest degree that he had
been undergoing any unusual exertion.
This was made all the more evident by the
fact that no sooner had he left the bag to
put on his blankets ttian he began a con
versation with Trainer Charley White, the
theme of which was a complaint regard
ing the condition of the ball, and his flow
of words was In no way interrupted by
shortness of breath.
Then boxine bouts were next in order
and he was at his lour starring partners,
alternating with ihem so as to give them
a rest, for three-quarters of an hour. And
still he had not tired. Trie Californian is
certainly in shape, so far as his powers of
endurance are concerned.
Billy Woods, the man who wears the
pneumatic face and the padded corset
when he boxes with Corbett, ha' been en
joying a two days' vacation. When Cor
bett gets at this armored gladiator he slogs
unmercifully, and despite tb.Â» protection
afforded by the pneumatic devices Billy
has been repeatedly floored and put to
sleep. Woods got tired or his job and
threatened to go out on a strike. Corbett
evidently realized that Billy's position was
no sinecure, and compromised by giving
his trainer two days off.
"A bloomin' truck horse couldn't stand
the pounding that I get from that big
chap," said Billy to-day. "I'm sore Id
every part of my body and it was getting
to be torture. Honestly. I believe if it
wasn't for the mask I wear I would have
had ruy bJoomin' head knocked off. Wait
till Fitz t-ets a few of these cracks and
then he will sympathize with me."
Outside of the Cornishman's dream
there was but little in the shape of inter
esting events to be gleaned at Cook's
ranch to-day, and those who went thither
and paid the usual admis-ion fee saw only
the usual routine. Fitzsimmons has got
right down to work of the hardest kind,
and it seems to apree with him im
mensely. He revels in it. His cold has
nearly disappeared, and aside from the
black eye Hickey decorated his counte
nance with the other day tie looks mag
nificent. He has gone "iooney" over
snipe shooting. Â«nd is out every morning
witn his gun and dog. He is a fair snot,
too, and usually brings home quite a mess.
News came from Empire to-day to the
effect that George Green, who ia training
for the welter-weight battle with "Mys
terious" Billy Smith, had a narrow es
cape from being drowned. There is a
dammed river in front of Green's training
quarters, and he and his chum, Bob Mc-
Arthur, frequently venture out upon it in
a little skiff for a row.
While out for one of their spins to-day
McArthur espied a slain duck floating in
tt c water, and dropping one of his oars,
reached for it. Green playfully attempted
to pet it first, and in the scramble the
skiff was capsized and buth fouud them
selves floundering in the water.
Bib is an expert swimmer and had little
difficulty in getting out of danger, but
Green found his heavy training dothes a
fearful handicap and could make no prog
ress at all. He nnally got hold of the
boat, however, and clung to it until assist
ance arrived. He has suffered no ill effects
so far from the experience and went on
with his training as usual. He is in splen
did shape just now and is certain tnat he
will whip Snuth.
Dal Hawkins, who is in training with
Green for the fight with Martin Flaherty,
is also in tine fix. J. G. Mansfield.
"NEVADA'S 1J18OIIA.CE."
Cleveland Frracher Attaila the Sage-
brush J'opulation.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 7.â Rev.
Levi Gilbert of the First Methodist Church
preached a sensational sermon to-nijht on
"Nevada's Shame and Disgrace." Ho
lampooned ihe State for legalizing prize
fighting, saying among other things:;
Its action was taken after the splendid
termination of even Texas to exclude prize
fiehtinir by special act of the Legislature. This
HiKte, this deserted mining camp, revives the
brutality by an exhibition whica must make
the Indiana and its Chinnmen wonder at
Christianity. Corbett is called a gentleman;
yet he ncted like nn infuriated animal In his
lust light and his wife wns divorced on grounds
affecting his morality. Ho is as dissipated as
is John L. Sullivan, who clubs his wifr.
Such exhibitions promote criminality by
feeding the bestinl in man. They debauch the
public ideal. Such men sho\V pluck, yes; but
no baitor than the Dulldo^ or tiger. These is
no spontaneous courage; they let themselves
bo battered for $5000. Prizo- Ugh ting is often
excused as no worse than Jootball. But bru
tality can b3 and olten l-t excluded from the
lniter. Brutality is an essential part of prize
fighting and cannot be eliminated.
On the seal of Nevada there is a picture of
the sun rising over the mountains, but on the
17lh it will feel like goini; into oclipse. St.
Patrick ought to feel on his birthday that he
has worse varmints than snakes to drive out.
TUE SAIjK OF SEATS.
Falling Off in the Demand for High-
Priced. Tickets.
Strange as it might seem the sporting
fraternity observed the Sabbath yesterday
to the creat disgust of Managers Cook and
Clark, who are here representing High
Chief Dan Stuart in the sale of tickets for
the great n-tic event to be decided on
March 17 in Carson. The sale was so
eood on Saturday, when it was begun,
that it was expected to be better yester
day, when people had more leisure to call
around and do business, but it was not.
The disposal of $0000 worth of seating
capacity that started the ball rolling was
made up principally of blocs sales.
Charles A-iher took $! 500 worth for bim
sfif and friends who had commissioned
him to act for them. Another $1000 worth
was taken by Harry Corbett and his part
ner, Burns, who are to run a special Pull
man excursion to anrt from the fight. The
remainder of the $6000 was put up by a
f'W special parties and a lew individuals.
Yesterday, however, t here were no block
sales. The tickets that passed over Mose
Gu list's counter were mostly single and at
the $20 rate.
The public does not seem to take kindly
to the box seals at $40 a throw. Yester
day's saleÃ amounted to only $890.

AT SHELL MOUND.
An Open -to -All Shoot for Cash
Prizes on the Man-Target.
The picnic season of 1897 was opened
yesterday at Shell Mound Park by a con
cert and picnic. â¬antain L. Siebe, the
proprietor, has had the entire premises
renovated and nut in perfect order. The
early trains took across the bay many
hundred pleasure-seekers, and by 3 o'clock
the number was increased to 5000 and the
0} ening was a success.
From 10 o'clock to noon a concert was
given, and tnen after the dinner hour
dancing was kept up until evening. An
other party found pleasure in the bowling
alley, where they bowled up to 7 o'clock
for cash prizes amounting to $100, offered
by Captain .Siebe. These prizes ranged
from $2J to $1.
There was but one attraction on the
grounds for the riflemen and that was the
nfle range, which was crowded from early
in the morning until as late as the targets
could be seen, for there was a grand pub
lic prize-shoot there, held under the
auspices of the Norddeutscl.er Schuetzen
Club. All of the shooting was on the
man target, four xhots, 80 points the pos
sible. The twenty-rive prizes agcregated
$225 and ranged from $30 to $1, besides
special prizes for best first and last shots
and most red flags for the 20-center line.
For a time it was supposed that George
S. Schulz was going to be high man with 77
and A. H. Pape Becond best with 76. Late
in the day D. W. McLaughhn got in his
work with bis new Pope barrel and made
78 out of a possible 80. He won the first
prize of $30, Schulz took the second, $25,
and Pape third, $20. The leading prize
winners and ther scores were as follows:

Narrow Kscape of Osciir T. Shuck.
At 5 :30 p. M. last evening Oscar T. Shuck had
a narrow escape from being run over by an
electric car on Kcarny street. He was walk
ing northward in front of the old City Hall lot,
which has a high wooden inclosure, between
which and the car track i? a space of about six
feet. To avoid a pool of rain water he made a
step to the left, which placed him directly on
one of the car rails, and an electric car KOing
also northward instantly struck him from be
hind. lie received the blow in the caif of the
left leg, but did not fall, nnd said to the grip
man (who had stopped his car), "Go ahead, it
was my fault." He declined to give hi* Dame
to the conductor saying, "I do not think it
amounts to much." Lu*t night Mr. Shuck
thought he would be at his business by to

* . The question, "Will the Senate confirm
the several appointees of. the Commander

' in a position to know who will be their

â¢ ' But there is one thing which is not to
their liking:, and that is the fact that the
.Legislature struck out of the appropria

night they would find that they had but
little to protect then against the chill, for
the overcoats they now have are afcout as
warm as a sheet of paper, and very thin
pap er at that.
Now that the appropriation for camp
sites' has been deni. d by the Legislature
the guardsmen are hoping that an appropria^
tion will be made to enable them to go Into
'car.lp this year without being obliged to indi
vidually foot .the expense in order that they
â¢ way acquire experience to enable them to
serve the State in case of necessity.

The Second i:ri{ada.
. The Second Brigade, particularly that por
tion which has headquarters in San Francisco,
has been remarkably quiet during the past
week.
The cadet company of the First Infantry,
Captain L. E. Edwards commanding, will go
'into amp for four days shortly after vacation
in the Lowell High School of this City. The
â¢boysof-this company are all students at th e
High School and they are imbued with a mili
tary spirit that could be well emulated by
older members of the guard. They are to have
a oat ion next week and instead of spending
their lime in idleness they decided that they
would go into camp for four days. They will
â¢to into Niles Canyon, Alameda County, and
establish a camp according to ' the strictest
military rules. The captain consulted with
# Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce.' acting colonel of
'the First Infantry, and ;ie has given permis
iton Jo establish the camp and has rendered
considerable assistance and given advice that
will be of service to the company.
'. â¢ Major Hugh T. Sime will accompany the
cadets and remain with them during the fou
flays, and while he will not be in command
over the hoys he will act in the capacity 01 ad
vispr.y officer. Maj >r Huber,Â« retired, late ol
the Second Artillery, has kindly loaned the
cadets the tents that they will quire, and
Lfeutenant-Colonel Thomas M. fluff, divi-ion
commissary, has made the necessary arrange
ments to see that the cadets are provided with
all that is necessary for their welfare. One
thing that the acting colonel of the First in-. ,
Msted upon was that no liquors of any kind
shall dc allowed on the camp grounds. The
cadets will start camp life either Monday or
Tuesday next.

The Signal Corps, Second Brigade.
The members of the Signal Corps, Second
Brigade, have Decome very enthusiastic in
their work oi late, and during the past two
I months not a Sunday has passed but some of
the members have been out on the hills prac
ticing with flags and heliograph and making
themselves familiar with the Meyer code of
signals, which is now used in the United
Slates army and has lately been adopted for
the National Guard of this State. The work
is hard ana difficult, but the young men who
belong to the corps are zealous and they are
aoing remarkably well with .the new code,
which is made up wholly of combinations Oi
1, 2 and 3. Yesterday they were engaged the
whole afternoon in signaling between Aita
Plaza and Lafayette Park
SaNTA ROSA, Cal., March 6.â Over sixty
wide-awake youne men generally answer the
roll call at the meetings of Company E of the
Fifth, and a more sociable and merry crowd
â¢ would be hard to find. Dramatic and musical
I talent abounds among the members and an
I entertainment is given about once a month.
j At the last social Captain C. E. Haven, who is
I not much given to things dramatic, was, by
; false pretences, inveigled upon the sJage dur
ing the performance and then anil there pre
sented with a handsome gold-mount.-d sword
as a gift from the company. Lieutenant
Holmes made the presentation speech. .
Orders have just been received here from thÂ«
adjutant-genera*'* office lor frergeant R. P.
â  Smith and Corporal J. R. Mailer to hold them
selves in readiness to participate in the State
championship shoot to be held at Sacramento
on March 27. Messrs. Smith and Mailer are of.
the championship class and wear gold medals
for previous high scores.
It is now considered certain that a new
armory ana dril.room will be erected by local
capitalists for the use of Company E. The
plans call for floor space 100x120. with dress
ing-rooms, stage and all modern conveniences.
Another improvement contemplated is a
; better shooting-ran
A range for the 200, 300 and 500 yard tar
i gets has been secured near Melitta, about four
I miles east oi the city. Upon the completion of
j the new electric railroad the targets will be
'â  moved to that spot.
A committee consisting of Captain C. E. Ho-
I yen and Lieutenants Holmes and Bean jour
j neyed to Petaluma recently for the purpose of
i presenting Company C of that city with the
handsome trophy won by it in the recent
shoot. The committee was right royally re
ceiVed and well entertained by the members
of Company C with a minstrel show, ball and
banquet.
EUctions were held recently to fill the civil
offices of the company, resulting in the selec
tion of W. H. Kidd as recording secretary, E.
A. Hutchinson a* financial secretary, and W.
J F. Cootes as armorer, with Captain O. E.
i Haven treasurer, ex-omcio. Company E was
I organized more than ten years ago, and has
j grown steadily in membership and efficiency
â  since its inception.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March Under the
efficient management ot Captain Shoemaker
of Company E, the Third Brigade is rapidly
corning to the front both in point of numbers,
in drill and field movements. The members
are all manifesting a great interest in their
work and scarcely a drill niyht passes but
finds a full attendance. Last night was de
voted to field and setting-up work, 'ihe mem
bers of the command are justly proud of their
\ record at the butts, and hope to become the
crack company in the State in this regard,
possessing as they do some of the best rifle
shots in the community in their ranks.
Troop B, cavalry, presented a fine appear
ance as it left it* armory on Sunday la-t,
mounted on fine gray worses, for a day's out
ing and practice in the saddle. The cavalry
j men took an easy jauut through the surround
ing country, stopping some five miles outâ at
I Perkins stationâ for lunch.
Owing to the threatening condition of the
weather, and not bjing equipped for a storm,
an early start was made lor home, arriving at
the armory shortly after 4 o'clock p. m. The
practice drill was greatly enjoyed by the
members of the troop, who ail showed up in
fine form and who are rapidly becoming very
proficient und.r the able handling of Captain
! Cooke, who insists trial duty .'hall be per
i formed correctly and lully possesses the confi
dence and esteem of his men. Fifty-two men
participated in the online, and joined in vot
ing it a complete success. The following mem
j bers have been sworn for one year: Corporal
' Gerber, Privates J. L. Sullivan "and Williams
' and Musicians llastenplug anil Schacht.
Company <; held a meeting lust night for
the purpose of perfecting a system to be Used
I at emergency calls. After several hours' dis
i cussion Ihe owing system was agreed
upon: Upon an emergency call being
j issued Captain Steam will" notify his
; two lieutenants, each of whom" will
1 notify two sergeants, who, in turn, will
i no tiiy the corporals; each ot me latter will have
| the address of seven private", all of whom ho
i musi notify, they being grouped in regard to
j their place of residence, so that each officer
' will have a certain territory to cover, and can
j cover hi-> rou:e i i the least possible time. The
j sergeants will follow the corporals, and give â 
| second notice, so tnat each private will be
! almost absolutely sure to receive notice. In
I the event of the absence or the illness of any
i officer, this duty will devolve upon the next
| ranking officer.
A week ago Thursday the company ap
) pointed a committee of seven to draft resolu-
I tions on the Cuban question. The n solutions
j were presented to the Cuban lea. ue Wednes-
I day night and published Thursday in the
i press.
The non-commissioned officers last night
I held a "school," whereat they discussed mili
i tary etiquette. The main subject touched on
last night was etiquette in letter and order
! writting.
The company has resolved that in event ot
| no camp appropriation being made this year
lit will go into camp, t/,e members pa*, in<r
j their own expenses, mid are looking about for
j other companies to join them and divide cx
i penses.
Captain Steams is very proud of his com
! pany and especially of his non-commissioned
officer?.
The State report for the last year shows that
forty-three men out of the total membership
of sixty-one qualified in the three snooting
c. asses. ' <
Wire-pulling has begun for the coming
company election. Everybody is out for office,
and it is n cmc of the dirk horse.
Work will soon be. commenced on the new
300 and 500 yard ranges. They will be situ
ated immediately north of the present range.
In spite of the very unsettled weather of
last Sunday, the signal corps of the .Third :
Brigade d.d some very sat.sfeciory heliograph
, work:. It Is very seldom that the'eorps misses
I an opportunity to take advantage of a Sunday
I "when the sun shines" and, instead of pistol
i practice, which has been the usual Hue of
work during the. rainy season, stations were
established at Sacramento and Newcastle, Ser
geant Bailey, taking charge , of the. home sta
tion on the Capitoi dome and Lieutenant Mar
tin running the Newcastle station, thirty
miles distant. â  â  â ....
Notwithstanding the clouded condition of

February Company D turned out in ihe morn
ing for field day exercises, and remained ou
the grounds until noon, during which time
battalion drill, guard mount, dress parade
and a sham battle were gone through with in
a manner reflecting credit on Capiain Morris

The day closed with a grand military bal
masque in the armory, Â«nd notwithstanding
the absence of Company H, who, though in
vited, did not come, on account <f the sina.l
number of men responding to the invitation,
the day wsis one long to b? remembered as a
gala event in our company history.
After the business meeting Tuesday night
lust the company drilled for an hour or more.
Each successive drill under the new captain
shows ihe men much improved in drilling,
and at next inspection they Will not bi found
as wanting in knowledge of the tactics as they
were at the last.
The regular monthly shoot for February was
held on the 21st of the month, and upward
of forty men engaged in target practice at the
200-yard rauge with the Hllowance of five
Â»hots each. The highest score was 23, but
several scores over 20 were made, ana not
more than six or seven failed to make the re
quired score to be enabled to shoot over the

WOODLAND, Cal., March s.â Last Wednes

will not return until some time next week.
The boys will have their first shoot at the
500-yard target one week from next Sunday.

I good aud strong to win.
The football team is on the anxious seat, us
j they expect to play the Suisun Valley team on

the boys beat them it will be quite a large,

The bicycle circuit r.ders are here now and

The members of the Naval Battalion Â«â¢
sernoled in large numbers last Tuesday nignt
I in the armory on East street to listen to a
I lecture de'ivered oy Lieutenant-Commander
Louis H. Turner, His lecture, a Terr intenst-
I ing one from a naval standpoint, covered a
great deal oi what in the past went to make
up naval waifare, and it also treated of
modern warfare. Hi dwelt upon the we nder
lul seamanship that was required to navigate
the United Slates frigate Constitution and
save her from live vessels that were seeking to
sink or capture her. Then he drew a picture
of me fight between that noble vessel and the
Guerricre and explained the many maneuvers
mat were mi-.de and which resulted In the vic
tory for those of tiie United Stales vefM'.
Tne licht between the Albania and the
Kearsarge occupied tne attention of his hear
ers, and wniie he did not find anything to
complain of in the management of that sea
battle he was of the opinion that the seaman
ship on steam vessels is not equal to that re
quired to manage a sailing vessel. He con
cluded by a description and criticism of the
naval warfare of modern times, particularly
the ship fights dii ring the recent war in China.
The battalion will have n baitaiion drill and
dress parnde on ihe Spreckeis wharf to-mor
row night.
Lieutenant Ever ley of the battle-ship Oregon
visited the Canianche last week and insrieeted
the men, saw them drill, an<i after making Â«
thorough examination stated that the naval
battalion at this point is tetter organized for
] work than any of the similar organizations
'on the Atlantic seaboard. He was the guest
j of Lieutenant Gunn.
The members of the battalion are anxious to
know if the I.eeislature will mnke an appro
priation of $0000 to enable them to place the
organization on a more perfect fooling than
it is now. The battalion has an engineer on
the Camanche but no engineer corps, and the
organization feels that it is very much liKethe
boy who had a kite but no string. The kite
was nice to look at, but not of unv use lor ris
ing in the space above. They have a ship, but
no men to work her. Their snip, the Co
manche. is nice to look at, but if required to
go into action she is unavailable. Tue mem
bers of the Military Committee when they in
spected the ship on 'Wash.ngtoii's b.rthday
anniversary declared thit the appropriation
asked for was very moderate, and that tne
battalion ought to receive what it oesired.
Several oi tnem openly decbired that they
wou.d see that the measure went through, but

Help the boulevard project-
Let us start the new era with good work.
The unemployed claim attention and
deserve it.
After this week comes the extra session
and politics will hum again.
There ie plenty of wort needed in San
Francisco to give employment to all her
industrious people. All ihat is lacking is
the means to sev it i;oine.
There will not be 100 much objection to
a protective tariff this ytar. The free
traders may growl a little, but they won't
tight.
There are many warm places within the
gift of McKinJey, but if any man prefers
one redhot he can apply for the Ministry
to Spain.
The new Senate will show many changes
from the Oid, but as nearly all of them
will be improvements the people won't
complain.
Secretary Gary carries to Washington
eight, unmarried daughter.^, and his house
is likely to be the grand court of the ad
ministration.
Since that Senator Chandler has discov
ered tiiat Senator Butler is an "uncorfced
Populist" he will confer a favor by putting
the cork back.
Now that we have an administration
that cares for American labor we shall
soon see a marked change from the condi
tions of Cleveland days.
It Weyler ever gives this administration
occasion to send him a note to stop op
pressing American citizens in Cuba, he :
will obey it without back talk.
The Greeks are bold in the consciousness j
that no matter what may happen as a j
result of war, there is bound to be left a j
grease spot in Europe somewhere.
It is being frequently stated in reports
of musical events in Europe that Patti
never sang so well for many years as she
is singing this winter. Look out for an- ;
other fareweil tour.
A Missouri legislator has introduced a
bill making it a misdemeanor for railroad j
conductors to flirt with women passen
gers, and his fellow members are in doubt
whether it is a bJow at the conductors or
the ladies.
There is actually a bill before the New i
York Legislature to prevent newspapers '
from publishing caricatures of public
men, but the chances are the men who are
pushing the measure only wish to get
their pictures printed.
A Chicago man has arisen with a claim j
for 600 acres within tne limits of Phiiadel- j
phia, but as he does not wish to live in i
that city He is willing to comDromise. In I
the pieantime Philadelphia is not dis- j
turbed and scornfully warns the Chicago j
man that if he continues to make such i
claims he may be run into a pork-packing
establishment some day and salted down.
The rapid increase in the size of ocean I
steamers between this country and En^- i
land nas already required larger harbor i
facilities ami both New York and London
are preparing to make them. If the de
mand for bigger ship" grows as rapidly as '
it has done in the past twenty year?, the j
next generation ma 7 have to enlarge the j
Atlantic or abandon Â»hip 3 altogether and
build a bridge.
They are having a high old municipal
campaign in Chicago. One oi the candi
dates on an independent ticket announces
that if elected he will allow every citizen
tue personal liberty to gamble if he feels
like it, while another declares he will
turn all the vacant lots in the city over to
the poor for the cultivation of potatoes
and beans. The voter has before him a
jackpot and a beanpot and can take his
choice.
The White Star Steamship Company
announces the intention of building a
steamer 704 feet in length, oi twenty-rive
feet longer than the Great Eastern, and it
is predicted that a steamer 1000 feet long
will soon be alloai. On such a ship it
would be possible to construct lawn tennis
courts, bicycle tracks and all the acces
?ories of a summer rÂ«aor{. Once on board,
a man might cross the ocean without
ever knowing he had left his notel.
There is danger that New York may
lose Madison- square Garden. THÂ« build
ing does not pay dividends on the invest
ment, and the stockholders arc not filling
to keep it up simply for the public beneiit.
In the fame way London is in danger of
losing Crystal Palace. It seems that if we
are to h;.ve pleasure buildings so large as
to be virtually roofed parks, they must be
provided by the government like open
parka. They are too costly for private
ownership.
A OOWAEDLY ASSAULT.
The Examiner yesterday added another
infamy to the large list of its recent
offenses by making a vile and cowardly
attack on Senator Morehouse.
The animus for the assault is of course
to be found in the fact that it was Senator
Morehouse who spoke out promptly and
bravely in defense of the Legislature from
the Examiner's vile and evidently un
warranted attack upon it, and who de
manded that the author of the defama
tion should be obliged to support its direct
charge with equally direct evidence or
suffer the consequence of publishing a
willful lie. Because Senator Morehouse
has compelled the attorneys and man
agers ol the Examiner to a confession of
guilt it turns upon him with the favorite
weapon ot a coward and attempts to
assassinate his character with an in
nuendo.
Senator Morehouse needs no defense
from such assaults as this. He is too well
accredited to the people of California as
one of its foremost citizens and as a gen
tleman whose public career and private
character are equally beyond the reach of
such assassins of reputation as the Ex~
amintr is known to be, to suffer from any
imputation which, this vile libeler may be
venomously moved to make. Tne object
of this resentment of the Examiner's cow
ardly blow at Senator Morehouse is to
auvise other citizens of like character and
reputation that they too are not safe from
equally villainous anil unfounded assaults
so long as the Examiner is permitted to
play coyote throughout the State of Cali
fornia snapping its dripping jaws at every
one who happens to cross its path or in
terfere with its cowardly and criminal
vocation.
THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK.
It is an unquestioned fact that business
is steadily though slowly improving. The
effects of the depression caused by the
free-trade tariff are still severely felt in all
parts of the country, but by degrees in
dustries are reviving, trade increases in
activity and public confidence is rapidly
re-establishing itself.
One of the depressing influences upon
the country is the deficiency in the Na
tional revenues. For the month of Feb
ruary it amounted to $4,206,804, and for
the current fiscal year up to tne close of
February it aggregated $48, 121,686. This
large and growing deficiency, added to the
debt already piled up during the Cleve
land administration, while it does not
form a serious menace to a nation so
wealthy as this, nevertheless constitutes
a source of annoyance to trade and indus
try and interferes materially with the ad
vancement of all Icinds'of enterprises.
The fact that an extra session of Con
gress has been called for the purpose of
providing a tariff which will put an end
to the deficiency 13 in itself a great en
couragement to business activity. The
Drogress of the revival of industry whicn
has hitherto been slow may be now ex
pected to advance with more rapid steps.
According to the best information ob
tainable there will be no prolonged oppo
sition to the new tariff bill in the extra
session of Congress, which is to assemble
next week. An early Cose to the defi
ciency is therefore well assured, and as a
result public confidence will soon return
to its normal conditions.
The business improvement, while it has
been slow, has been substantial. There
has been no overspeculation in tne coun
try for years. Everything is on a oedrock
basis, from the price of clothing to the
price of land. The trade of the country is
on a foundation absolutely solid. It is
one on which men can afford to build
with courage and enterprise, because it is
known to be safe and secure. There is
every reason therefore why we should go
forward with confidence, for the outlook
is more promising than bus bsen known
since the accession of Cleveland to otlice.
Fr^m the time when the new tariff bill
is reported to Congress until it goes in:o
effect there will be a large import of for
eign coods. Dealers will take every ad
vantage of the chance to get European
articles into the country before the higher
duties of protection are imposed. Thts
will to some extent disturb home indus
try, but the disturbance w;il be of short
duration. It is expected that the new
tariff can bs put into operation by the Ist
of July, and that date therefore may be
set for the commencement of the realiza
tion of much of the prosperity which we
expect with the McKinley administra
tion.
EXPORT OF FfiUIT.
In the latest volume of Consular Reports
issued by the Department of State there
is reproduced an article that appeared in
the New York Sun last fall, and upon it
Eugene Germain, the United States Con
sul at Zurich, make* sJtne comments and
gives some suggestion" that will be of in
terest to California fruit-growers. He has
a theory of what method our shippers
must adopt to secure a remunerative mar
ket in Europe, and to that theory he has
brought an evidence of Us correctness by
citing the practical results which have fol
lowed the pursuit of a similar plan by citi
zens of Switzerland who have made mil
lions by the method.
The pith of tha long article quoted from
the New York Sun is thnt the exportation
of California fruits to London has been a
losing came, but nevertheless a number of
capitalists persint in the traffic and expect
better results in the future.
The first sentence in Germain's corainent
on this article is to challenge the latter
statement with being one of those literal
truths which convey a false impression to
the reader. These determined capitalists
mentioned by the Sun he thinks have no
money invested in fruit-growing or fruit
shipping, except so far as their interests
in transportation are concerned. They take
no risks, and their profits do not necessa
rily go band in hand with the prosperity
of the producers. Tee transportation
charges and the commissions are guaran
teed, and when fruit is dumped on a glut
ted market it is the consignor and not the
consignee, the grower and not the trans
porter, who catches the disaster of the
deal.
The plan proposed by the Consul is for
fruit-growers to combine, appoint some
men of their own number who are finan
cially interested in the growing of lruiti,
and send them to the big European mar
kets ai permanent resident agents. These
men, as noon as they are advised by cable
of the shipments coming, aie to canvass
the cities and send sub-agents to the in
land io'.vus to place the fruits where they
are most wanted. These agents will gather
information about the crop prospects of
other countries and inform their consign
ors what to sen<! and what pay to expect.
hi practical illustration of ths workings
of the plan it is pointed out that many
magnificent palaces recently erected in
Switzerland and inhabited by millionaires
are the results of this method of merchan
dising. In thÂ« town of Zurich alone,wbich

has but 149,000 inhabitants, the tax lists
show ninety-one millionaires.
This information is a little surprising,
for we are prone to think of the Swiss as a
frugal people wiio are content to live on
cheese and sublime scenery, ban Fran
cisco, though famed as a city of miflion
aires, is in a condition of deplorable pov
erty when compared with Zurich. To
equal that little town we should havo
some 200 millionaires. It would be worth
wnile to try the Swiss plan and see if we
coula not obtain tlie Swiss results. The
communication of the Consul is published
in full in "Consular Reports No. 197" for
February, 1897, and we commend its con
sideration to fruit-shippers.
A CHICAGO CANDIDATE.
A Chicago lawyer who is described by
the press of that city as a disbarred at
torney has announced himself as. an inde
pendent candidate for the office of Circuit
Judge on a platform so broad and scat
tered that it looks more like a lumber
yard than a platform It professes to be a
declaration of the ri^ht of men to life,
liberty and ihe pursuit of happiness, but
in its details it declares for free gambling,
lotteries, saloons, opium-joints and little
games on the side.
The candidate has issued a manifesto to
the people, in which he begins by saying,
"All men are by nature frre and inde
pendent and have certain inherent and
inalienable rights." He then asserts,
"Any statute law which abridges these
rights is clear'y and unequivocally in op
position to the constitutions of the State
and of the United States," and declares
to the voters:
If yon elect me to the position of Judge of
the Circuit Court I will be enabled to dis
charge at once on a writ of habeas corpus any
citizen arrested In this county for violation of
either or all the laws and ordinances against
lawful gambling, pool-selling, horse-racing,
lotteries, etc. After such discharge, from
which there is no appeal by the prosecution,
the accused is absolutely Jroe to continue his
business. If the authorities or others inter
fere with the personal rights of any citizen,
and ho has not the personal courage or ability
to protect himself in the lawful exercise of
such rights, I should feel in duty bound to
issue an injunction restraining such officials
from all further acts of usurpation and
tyranny.
That this platform may be more accept
able to the people of Cnicago, the candi
date proceeds to argument. ''The masses
of the people,' he declares, "should not
be deprived of tneir inherent rights or the
Nation converted into a gigantic kinder
garten because a lew weak-minded indi
viduals cannot take care of themselves.
Legitimate gambling," he adds, "if unre
stricted, will till our deserted office build
ings with paying tenants and put in cir
culation at lease $5,000,000 annually.
Horse-racing and pool-selling would bring
to our city and circulate among tho people
at least $10,000,000 more. Honest lot
teries, if established, would gather into
the coffers of Chicago not less than $20,
--000,000 per annum, making a total of
$35,000,000 which should now be circulat
ing in Cook County."
It will be interesting to see bow many
votes Chicago polls for a candidate on
that platform. It will no doubt be entic
ing to those who desire to see a larger
Chicago, for it promises to let down the
bars and run the city wide open. The can
didate claims to have obtained over 10,000
names to his petition fora place on the of
ficial ballot within a few days after he
began his canvass, and says he will hava
125,000 before the time comes for riling it.
There is just one candidate of the kind
In the country, and. it is not surprising
that Chicago has him.

"The heavy growth of bnncn grass, shrubs

The lack of men for tiie British navy, which
is frequently made a topic of discussion in
and out of Parliament, appears to be not well
founded, and the fact is that the navy can al
ways have as many as it wants and have its
pick of the best. Twice during the past year
the standard of admission was raised, and in
6pite of this 40 per cent of those serviceable
could not be admitted. It is the personnel of
a reserve navy that is wanted rather than
blue-jackets and mechanics for the regular
navy.
At the Vulcan shipyard, near Stettin, Prus

for the Chinese Davy. They are each of 2950

are to have engines o.' 8000 horsepower to drivt
the ship 19? o knots. Their armament consists
of three Gincji and eight 4-inch quick-firing
guns of the Krupp pattern, and also six V/i
--inch Hotchkiss and six Maxim guns. The
torpedo-tubesâ threeâ are all above water. In
the same yard two cruisers of 5G50 and 5900
tons are being built for the German navy.
Asa protection against torpedo attacks a
Dr. Jones proposes to lit vessels with steel
shields made in the form of the hull, which
in ordinary circumstances will rest against
the vessel itself. The shields are to be fastened
to tne ship at the top with hinges, and are
loose at the bottom, and capable of baing pro
jected outward for a distance of twenty feet.
The notion of the learned doctor is that these
shields and the cushion of water between
them and the shin wi.l protect the latter from
material injury should a torpedo be exploded
against the guard. The project, however, Is
not seriously considered by naval men, who
see the insurmountable obstacles in carrying
out the idea into practice. As torpedo booms
and nets have been abandoned, the only and
best means of protection lies in the quick
firing guns, of which now a greater number
than ever is carried, mainly with tne object of
disabling or destroying hostile torpedo-boats.

INDUSTRIAL INVASION OF ENG
LANT.
Philadelphia Press.
The industrial revolution involved in the
appearance of American steel in England has
created a sensation out of all proportion
greater there than here. English newspapers
see in it the ultimate supremacy or our steel
trade the world over. English steel masters
face on one side the cheap labor and technical
skill of Germany and Belgium, and on tin
other the dear labor and cheap materials of
this country. English coke costs over $2 a
ton, where ConneUsvtlle is $1 25 to $1 50.
Yet our best furnaces use only 1000 pounds of
coke to the ton of steel, when English furnaces
use 2000 pounds. English newspapers are
asking If the invasion is to be permanent. As
it is based on a cheaper cost-aneet it has cer
tainly come to stay. No country in the world
can compete with $20 steel rails or billets ac
$15 or 10. _______________

A Field Day at the Presidio on the

Who Want to Retire.
'flic new casemates for tbe twelve-inch
disappearing gun that is to be placed in
positinn nt the fortirication at Fort Point
has bren completed, and the work of
placing the monster gun in place will soon
be commenced.
Another of the ten-inch-rifled pieces is
being placed in position noar the one that
was tested a few days since. This work 's
accomplished very much as is the branch* i
ing of a ship, but on the inverse principle.
Long and very strong ways are built from
the ground to the elevation on the car
riage on which the gun is to be placed,
and the piece, instead of being slid down
the ways as is a ship, is hauled up the
ways by slow stages.
Considerable armament that will be
qaed In completing the fortifications at
tbe point were delivered last week and
will soon be ready to place in position.
Tbe War department is becoming quite
jealous of its fortifications of late, for it
appear* that an important order has been
prepared relating to the inspection of
coast and defenses by civilians. It pro
vides that hereafter civilians cannot visit
fortifications except upon written passes
siened by the proper authoriiy, and that
such permission will not be granted ex
cept for military reasons. It Is said that
the reason of this order is that at many
places the country's points of defense are
nearly completed, and that a description
of the character of such defense and ex
tent thereof would prove of great value to
foreign Governments.

The Sf. Patrick's Day Con
vention Denounces the
Nevada Mill.
Friends of the "Monitor" Adopt
the Resolutions It Has
Advocated.
Preparations for a Glorious Celebra
tioa of the Day ia San
Francisco
There was a large attendance at the St.
Patrick's day convention at K. R. B.
Hall .yesterday afternoon and arrange
ments were almost completed lor the
great celebration on the 17th.
The committee on talent reported that
nearly every theater in the City had
offered some stars to make tbe literary
musical programme at the Temple a suc
cess.
The most important piece of business of
the day was the triumph of the friends of
Rev. P. C. Yorke and t:ie Monitor in the
matter of the anti-prize-light resolutions.
They were adopted by an overwhelming
majority, tue only delegate against them
beinar M. Nichols, who declared himself a
prize-tighter and the friend of prize-fights.
The following are the resolutions that
were adopted:
Whereas, It has beec made notorious
throughout the United States that a prize- light
will be held at Carson, Nev., on next St. Pat
rick's day; and whereas, this convention, for
the proper celebration oi St. Patrick's day in
this City has approval for legitimate and
xnenly sports of all kinds, underreliabie direc
tion, in conformity with the well-kno*n love
of Irishmen for such SDoris and their uniform
success in contests of strength, endurance and
skill; and whereas, a prize-tight, under the
best circumstances, possesses bo characeris
tics of true sport, but is repulsive to me best
element of our people; therefore, be it
Resolved, That we appeal to our people, to
the many among them who are lovers ot true
athletic n nines aud sports, to discountenance
the coming fight, to keep away from It and to
repel authoritatively any suggestion that it has
the support or approval of reputable Irishmen.
The following communication from
Rev. Father Grey was received and
placed on file after a vote of thanks to the
writer:
San Francisco, March 5.
John Mu'hern, Chairman St. Patrick's Day con
ventionâ Dear Mr. Mulhkrn: Tnrough you, as
chairman ol the St. Patrick's day convention, I
j extend a cordial invitation to the gentlemen
I of the convention and to the various Irish
societies which they represent to atteud the
solemn celebration in honor of St. Patrick, the
j patron of the cnurch, on March 17, St. Pat-
I rick's day.
The celebration In our church this year will
be of uuus:ial solemnity, as the silver jubilee
or twenty-fifth anniversary of the dedication
; of the cuurcli will be celebrated.
There will be pontifical high mass at 9
o'clock by his Grace Archbishop P. W. Rior
i dan, at which the eloquent chancellor of the
I archdiocese, Rev. P. C. Yorke, will preach. I
j With sincerest wishes for the success of your
own celebration, I remain, very sincerely,
P. J. Ukey.
The tenor of yesterday's meeting leaves
no doubt that tiie Si. Patrick's day cele
bration will be a success. The delegates feel
that the cause of the new Irish hali is
promising. Frank Shea spoke encour
agingly of the outlook, saying ne thought
tbe hall would surely be built soon.
The following wera appointed commit
tee to assist Rev. Father McFadden next
Wednesday evening: John Mulhern,
Frank Conklin, J. J. Donovan, P. Tam
ony, J. Deveney, P. O'Brien.

A DASH FOR LIBEETY.
Thonias Jolinftnn'g Kace and Capture
in trout of the County Jail.
An exciting race of a fleeing prisoner
and a police uilicer in hot pursuit offered
a treat for the spectators in front of the
County Jaii on Broadway Saturday after
noon.
The occurrence which led up to John
son's dash for liberty was caused by the
carelessness of Jack McNamara, the bailiff
of Judge Campbell's court, when taking a
consignment of convicted criminals from
the Central police station to jail in the
van. He neglected to handcuff Johnson
and trio, Johnson's partner, James Hanly,
blbo charged with burglary, to a "hobo"
who was under sentence of ten days for
some trivial offense.
When the prison van reached the County
Jail Johnson no sooner landed on the
ground than he made a dash for lilerty.
Chief Jailer A. Sattler had fortunately
gone down to the sidewalk to assist Mc-
Namara hi marching his men up the
steps, and as soon as Johnson ran he held
on to the remaining seven. But here
luck war. against the fiVeinji prisoner, for
Ponce Officer Thomas Friel in citizen's
clothes was standing on trie sidewalk and
at once gave chae, and, after a run of two
blocks down Kearny street, cauirnt John

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 8, 1897.
LIGHT FROM MANY PULPITS
Doings of Sunday Among the Churches and
the Church Peopleâ Sermons on
Varied Topics*
The annual cervices of the Calvarian
Society were inaugurated yesterday after
noon aj. St. Mary's Cathedral, and will be
continued each Sunday throughout Lent.
The cathedral was crowded beyond its
seating capacity, a fact partially account
ed for by the announcement that the
Arcii bishop would speck.
The services opened with the Way of
the Cross, celebrated by Rev. Joseph F.
Byrne.
Arcbbishop Riordan's sermon was from
the first words of Christ upon the eross â
"Father, forgive them; for they know not
what they do."
The reverend speaker prefaced his ad
dress with a word picture of the scene of
the crucifixion. He divided the spec
tators into three groups. First wera the
Roman Boldiers, indifferent to the fate of
their victim. Then he spoke of the Jav,-
itÂ»h rabble, who, having been taught all
tlfeir lives to look for a redeemer, hated
and spurned him when he came. The
third group was that of the faithful and
loving, of which Mary was one. Modern
analogies were pointed out to each of
these groups.
Speaking of Christ's words upon the
cross tbe Archbishop said:
"A queer place this, perhaps you think,
to call God his father. We think of God
as judge or avenger or father as our leel
ings are. Sometimes when everything
seems dark and without hope we are apt
to think God has forsaken us or is a long
way < ff. That is why at this moment,
bleeding and suffering upon the cross, our
Lord wished to emphasize the fact that
Gou 13 always â¢ father.
"Love guides all things. We are living
under an empire and a rule of Jove. God
is shaping tilings so that if we live right
all will ba well. "Father, forgive them,'
he said. This is the vt-ry essence of the
Christian religion and there ts no other.
Love, lorgiveness, charity. If these are
not at the root of your religion you are
not of Christ.
"Forgiving, forgivinsr. forgiving! Is
not that what be is doing all the time
and is not that what we are continually
asking. Rend any page you will of the
Old or New Testament and it is always
ttie same over and over again â charity,
charity and forgiveness.
"We are brethren of the forgiven ones.
He not only asks our Heavenly Father to
forgive, but he makes our "forgiveness
conditional upon forgiving others. How
things would change if we could carry
this spirit out into the world 1 Remem
ber, forgiveness is no easy thing. Love
your friend and hate your enemy was tbe
law under the old law, but our Lord said,
'No, love thy enemy.' "
In his exhortation the Archbishop said
that Catholics could not plead ignorance,
as divine trace was always pleading witii
them. Their only hope was in repen
tance, by which ho advised them to seek
God.
During tbe benediction the singing was
renuered by the girls of the Technical
School.
HEMPHILL EXPECTS WAR.
Good Time to Come Will Follow
Awful Carnage of Nations;
Key. Dr. Hemphill talked of war and
current warlike indications last night at
the Calvary Presbyterian Church.
He took for hi* text:
IÂ»aiah xxi:ll-12: Watchman, what of the
nittbt? Tue waicuinan said: '-The morniug
comelli and also the night.' 1
The doctor showed that the watchman's
answer found its fulfillment in the history
of nations. Assyria, Nint-vah, Babylon,
J.gypt, Israel, Greece, Rome, each ad
vances from the Jionzon, reaches the
zenith, b;azes for a while in splendor and
then sets in night.
And coming to our own {day we ask the old
question, "What ot the |nigbt?" and the old
LIVELY TIMES
ON THE FRONT
Whitehall Boats and Tugs
Were All in Evi
dence.
There Was No Regular Rac?, but
the Boatmen Had a Prac
tice hptn.
Another Record U Brcken by the
Alaska Steamer
Qaeen.
There were niore lively scenes on the
! bay yesterday than there have been for
many a das\ A wnqle fleet of Whitehall
boats were out on a practice cruise, nearly
every steam launch and gasoline-boat
along the front was in commission, and in
spite of the threatening weather all the
excursionists had a pleasant time of it.
The whit-halls were to have had a race
"for blood" at 2 p. m., but when starting
time came the wind was light and half a
dozen of the boatmen withdrew. Finally
a "scratch" race was got ud, and the tide
answer is true. Poets and prophets huve sung
of the good time cominis when men sl:ali learu
war no more. Very line words, but <lo they
correspond to facts? To Cuban and Cretan
lacts, for example? or are they not rather the
rhapsodies of sanguine theorists? So it
wouid seem.
We hear the'thunder of war in Cuba and in
Crete presaging, it; may bo, s til L more d'eaii
ful war. We were feUcitatinK ourselves upon
the peace treaty between England and the
United States. We were beginning to think
that other nations were following our good
exumple and that war was over lor ever. The
conclusion is too hnsty. We hear mennciug
eclioes from afar aud the creaking of tottering
t a rones.
Will there be a general war in Europe be
causu of the Cretan diriiculty, and if so what
will the end be? Will there be a new map of
Europe?
God alone can tell. We do not love war.
We hate it. Wu would if we could sheathe the
Rword of war forever. We would if we could
bid carnage awÂ»y from her cursed carnival.
We would if we could stop this Spaniards'
bloody butcheries in Cubn. We wouid stop
ihe Turks' Dloody butcheries iv Armenia,
Crete and elsewhere. And we would stop it
without war. But maybe we are too hopeful.
Prophtcy, if I read it aright, teaches me that
the g od time will not be ushered in peace
fully, but in a horror oi' great darkness And
amid the terrible thunders of war.
I should not be surpn.-ed if we were on the
eve of the most terrible war that the worirt
has ever seen; nor should I be surprised if all
the nations of Europe went into ii.
We talk of the good time comingâ H is a
pleasant theme, and all the more peasant be
cause it is true. So our text siys: -'The
morning cometti";but it, says moreâ "and
also the night." The good tune ushered in
will be ushered in as every good time has
been ushered in â amid dark and angry
clouds. Who can tell what convul.-aons and
upheavals of nations shall attend the death
throts of old systems and the birth-puiiÃs
of new ones? The phoenix of new Institutions
can arise only out of the ashes of the old. Tur
key will be carved sooner or later. The oid
question will bo heard again, ''What oi the
night?" and the old answer will be In time:
"The morning cometh, and also the night."
Coming to our own land. It is at once
bright with promise and dark with threaten
ing, churches multiplying, missionary opera
tions extending, benefactions increasing. We
coneratulate ourselves 88 oniy Americans ran
upon our progress. Hut do we look at the
other side of the picture? Do we remember
that our land is being invaded by an army
from across tbe seas, most of them inv.ncible
to our institution*? that it is under the heel
of a most heartless despotism, the liquor
despotism? that our politicians, many of them,
are as conscienceless a set of thieves as ever
cursed a nut ion V that our land swarms with
fiery anarchists and sullen socialists, w hoso
creed is, "Away with the State and with re
ligion, away with God"?
Xo; we do not remember. We are blindly
optimistic. We say, "The morning cometh";
we forget to finish the sentence, "And also the
night."
The speaker concluded with, one hope
ful thought: that as Christianity by ms
inherent power had conquered all enemies
In the past it would do so in the future.
AN ALLEGORICAL LESSON.
Bible Story of the Destruction of
the Children by the Bears Has
a Figurative Meaning,
Rev. J. S David of the Sweaenborg Mis
sion Society said in his sermon at Wash
ington Hall yesterday: "When we read
the Btory of the destruction of lorty-two
children by two she bears from the woort
for tuo simple offense of - mooting thÂ»
prophet Eiisha we are apt to wonder why
it was written, since it seems to show
more cruelty ihan justice.
"But it is one of those 'dark sayings of
old' which contains divine truth veiled in
allegory; it is o.ie of those Bib c nuts
which has a rou?h and dusky shell, but
when opened is lound to coniain meat
which nourishes the soul. Like many
other strange passages its internal beauty
is the evidence of its divinity. It teaches
us that spiritual death from denying in
heart and life the letter oi revealed truth.
"As a prophet was a teacher of the
word, to mock the prophet is to despise
the teachings of tne worJt and live con
trary to them. When this is done the
loves of evil ana falsity, emerging from
proving favorable, at least eight of them
rounded Blossom Rock in a bunch. They
kept close together all the way to the
Pres.dio shoal buoy, but there "old man"
Crowley, in his son's boat, out-maneu
vered the rest of the contestants and beat
them home by at least ten lengths. The
real contest will take place next Sunday,
and "Jimmy" Sennett and "Snake" Fitz
gerald assert that Crowley and his boat
'won't be in it."
The owners of the wbitehalla will have
to do a considerable amount of maneuver
ing next Sunday in order to make ns
pretty a scene as they did yesterday when
rounding Blossom Rock for the run to the
Presidio.
Tbe tuj- Walter Hackett, with a party
from the Western Addition Social and
Athletic Club, aiso made a tour of the
bay. The party was landed on Angel
I- In ml, later went to Sausalito and then,
after enjoying a clambake on Goat Island,
followed the boats around the course to
Fort Point and back.
The steam launch Mascott, with young
Mr. Talbot aboard, was also out. She has
been thoroughly overhauled and repaired
and made a most creditable showing. She
and the new gasoline launch Lizzie I) had
a spurt along the front, and when the
quarantine launch Governor Perkins, with
JDr. Williamson and some other member*
of the Board of Health abonrd, the raoe
was quite interesting lor a few minutes.
The Perkins finally carried of! the honors,
but the Lizzie D ana the Muscott, while
beaten, were not disgraced.
While racing along the front some of
the men had to pull out and save the pet
of all the frequenters of Powell street
wharf. "Bum" is a fine specimen of ihe
Newfoundland dog and while he belongs
to no one in particular every one has an
interest in him. Yesterday "Bum" was
attacked by a aea lion. The iattor thought
the dog was after a fish he had secured
and a fierce fight ensued. The dog was
getting the worst of it and would soon
have been bors de combat had not Jimmy
Black and Officer Ferguson put out in
the dark forest of our lower nature and
waxing bold and fierce, will destroy the
children, which are the states of inno
cence undeveloped and dwaried by
neglect. The holy prophet seems to curse
tue children, but IB reality the holy word
never curses any one; for it is the expres
sion of infinite and eternal love, which
cannot curse, but the perveision or abuse
of truth curses and destroys."
SUPERSTITION.
Rev. W. Rader Says the Church Is
Bursting: Away From Tradition
and B coming Rational.
The Rev. William Rader of the Third
Congregational Church preached a ser
mon on "Superstition" yesterday even
ing. He spoke of the celebrated sermon
delivered by the Anostle Paul on Mars
Hill in Athens. Part of bis discourse was
as follows: "A popular preacher walks
through the streets of Athens and paus
ing before one of many altars reads tbe
inscription, 'To the Unknown God.' He
passes to the summit of Mara Hill, over
looking that scene of beauty and wealth,
while he addresses an audience of Athen
ians on the subject of superstition. The
fame of his eloquence precedes him and
all Athens responds, to listen, to scoff, to
turn away with the trumpet notes of a
mighty sermon ringing In their ears. With
delicate tnct he aconses these people of
being â¢over-religious.' This ia a profoundly
true estimate of heathenism, which is not
infidelity but perverted religion.
"At the bottom of all superstition is a
certain religious element. We have not
yet outgrown the superstition of the past.
It expresses itself in a false theology. The
unreasonaDle elements oi the faiths of the
world have not come from cool reason,
but from heated and passionate supersti
tion. Some of these old dreams have in
corporated themselves in the religious
systems of the world, and the transition
ttiat is now going on b a rebellion against
a superstitious theoloey. The current of
thought is set against the false, dreams of
the fathers. The church is delivering
itself from folk lore. It is bursting away
from tradition; it is ten ling toward free
dom. The rational is supplanting the su
perstitions."
BLESSED THE STATIONS.
Passion Pictures Solemnly Blessed
at St. Rose' 3 Church.
At St. Rose' 3 Church was performed
yesterday afternoon the beautiful cere
mony of the canonical erection of the
stations of the cross. These stations,
which consist of fourteen oil-paintings
representing scenes in the life of Christ,
were donated by members of the parish.
Tlifv were all executed under contract by
an Eastern firm and are very beautiful.
The canvases are 3 feet 10 inches by 5 feet
6 inches. They are inclosed in Gothic
frames of Spanish cedar.
The institution of the stations in the
churches whs auÂ« to St. Francis of
Assisie, and for this reason a member of
the Order of St. Francis is always se
lected, when possible, to conduct the cere
mony of piectine the station*.
Father Leo Brunor, O. S. F., pastor of
St. Anthony's, perform-d this office yes
terday. He preceded the ceremony wiih
a sermon, in which he gave a historical
sketcn of the institution of the stations.
He exhorted his hearers to make the way
of the cross as often as possible and to at
tend the public celebration of this cen
mopial on Friday evening during Lent.
In tin' solemn blessing of the stations
Father Bruner was assisted by Fathers
Nugent and Keneaily.

enraged lion. By the time the tight was
over at least a dozen boats were around
tbe scene and the crowd on Powell street
wharf was wild with excitement.
The ferry steamer Bay City had a nar
row escape last night. A barge with a big
tank on it broke adrift from the oil works
and went ashore near AJviso. The bottom
was stove in, but at high water the tank
picked tij> the barre and started down the
bay. Off Goat Island it was right la the
way of the ferry-boat and Captain Bradley
had to stop the Hay City acd go "full
speed astern" in order to save a collision.
An hour later the tank and barg^ were
high and dry on Goat Island.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Queen has brok-n the record between here
and Victoria, B. C. The City of Puebla,
which is now being overhauled, has made
the run in 48 hours and 40 minutes, but,
accord m e to a dispatch received by Good
all, Perkins & Co. yesterday, the Queen
made the run in 46 hours and 50 minu.es.
She left here last Tuesday at 9:4 ! J a. m. and
arrived in Victoria, JJ. C, on Thursday at
S:3O a. M., thus beating all records. The
Queen was repaired and had new ma
chinery put in at enormous expanse, but
now the members of the company. can
congratulate themselves on the fact that
they have the fastest and one of the best
equipped vessels on the Pacific.
The Oregon was crowded with visitors
yesterday. If she be not ordered around
the Horn at once she will go to Port Orch
ard lo have rolling chocks put on. The
latter nave been made at Mare Island and
will be sent to the n&vnl station on Puget
Sound next week where they will be ready
for use as soon as the battle-ship puts in
an appearance.
Fred Larsen pot into trouble on the
front yesterday. He raise'! a row in Al
White's and Officers Uourneen and Me-
Grath arrested him for disturbing the
peace. At the station a long piece of lead
pipe loaded with shot was found in his
pocket, so he was also charged with car
rying a concealed weapon. Larsen is
mate on one of the coasting steamers and
bears a good character.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 8, 1897.
SEALIONS WILL
BE PROTECTED
The Government to Pre
vent Their Killing
by Hunters.
Ex-Mayor Sutro and David
Starr Jordan to the
Rescue.
Revenue Cutter Richard Rush R â¢
ceives Orders to Patroi the
Faral on Islendii
The great American Government has
str tched out its protecting arm over the
giant sealiona that inhabit the Farallones
and form one of the natural curiosities of
this coast. If the vandals who have an
nounced their intention of killing them
for the profit to be derived from their
hides and oil attempt to carry out their
scheme they will be confronted by the
frowning muzzles of tne guns of the cutter
Richard Rush.
The threat to exterminate these animals
was made public some time ago, and ex-
Mayor Sutro and Professor David Starr
Jordan of Stanford University both took
up the cudgels In defense of the big seals.
They addressed strong letters to the
United States District Attorney's office
protesting against the proposed slaughter
and asking whether there were not laws
on the statute-books protecting the Lons.
Ex- Mayor Sutro told United States Dis
trict Attorney Foote that if tlie Faral
lones were not under the jurisdiction and
protection of the United States Govern
ment they should be, and requested that
the National authorities be communicated
with regarding the proposed killing. Ho
stated that it was a fals â¢ ide;i that the
seals were annihilating the fish tnat run
in and out of the bay, and that this fact
was proven by the unusually large num
ber of h-h found about the Seal Rocks.
Professor Jordan wrote that it would-be
nothing sbort of criminal to destroy the
animals, as they were a natural curiosity
that should not, in the interest of science,
be allowed to become extinct. It was im
pressed on Attorney Foote that if the seals
on the Farailones were killed those on the
Seal Rocks would also leave, and that one
of the greatest attractions to tourists from
the East and interior would be destroyed.
Assistant United States Attorney Bert
Schlesinger, to whom the matter was re
ferred, after looking up the laws carefully,
answered Messrs. Sutro and Jordan that
there appeared to be no law protecting
the Farallon seals and that the only way
of protecting them would be by an appeal
to "Washington. This course was taken
by Mr. Sutro and the facts of the case
were also transmitted by the United States
Attorney's office.
The result was that within a fpw days
past orders were sent out for the Richard
Hush to prevent aU seal hunting on the
Farallones and to protect the animals in
evsry way possible. The Rush will make
regular trips to the Farallones to $cc that
the orders of the Government are carried
out.
In an interview last evening United
States District Attorney Foote Btated that
there was no question of tbe jurisdiction
of the Government over the Farallone\
and that no killing of seals would be per
mitted.

RUTHVEN ON CATHOLICISM.
The Ex-Priest SayÂ« Rome Wants to
Kule America.
Lecturer Ruthven, who says he was a
priest in Australia, lectured to a large
audience at Metropolitan Temple yester
day afternoon. His subject was "Shall
Rome Rue America?"
He held that Archbishop Ireland had
claimed that America would be Catholic
by the year 1900. "They have not much
time in which to convert the country,"
he said, ''and as they have lost Europe,
they have no chance in America."
The speaker dwelt on tbe public
school question, and held that it is the
cnief ambition of Rome to get absolute
control of temporal and spiritual affairs in
the United States.
Miss Phzinger's new song, l4 >Tew
America," was rendeieJ during the after
noon. There will be speaking at tbe
temple next Sunday by Ruthven.

AN OLD TRUNK
Ths Public Administrator
to Unravel the Booth
Mystery.
<
Possessed of Great Wealth a
' Countess Received Aid From
the County.
Died in Poverty, Not Knowing of
Valuable Bods That Lay in
Her Truak
â¢ Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 7. f
- The Public Administrator has applied
for letters on the estate of the late Mar
garet Booth, and will endeavor to un
ravel the mystery surrounding her pos
session of papers of great value found
after her death among her belonging.
It has ceen discovered that Mrs. Booth,
who was a Scotch Countess and a direct
descendant of Baron Ross, who was her
grandfather, was not aware that she pos
sessed a. single cent In her trunk were
found Government bond* and* stock re
ported to be worth about $50,000. This,
however, was not known until after the
Public Administrator had turned over the
supposedly valueless belongings of the
o d lady to her grandson, Joseph Booth of
Yallejo, who was thought to be the only
heir.
Now it appears that the old papers were
Â£iven Mis. Booth by her mother, and
that consequently the daughter of the
dead woman, Mrs. Dr. Fonday, would be
an heir as well as her other children.
Mrs. Fonday died some years ago in West
Oakland, but left several children, who are
us much entitled to a share of their grand
mother's property as the heir at Vallejo.
During her last illness Mrs. Booth was
attended be Dr. Coxheaa in her humble
quarters on Seventh street, and to the doc
tor she contided the wnole story of her
life. Most of it has already been pub
lished, but it is absolutely certain that the
old lady was totally unaware of the value
of the papers in her possession. For sev
eral months prior to her death she was in
receipt of a small monthly allowance
from the county and dependent upon the
chanty of a few wealthy ladies who as
sisted her through the medium of the
"Woman's Exchange.
The Masonic papers in her possession
date bact over a hundred years, and it is
more than poss.ble that the heirs of the
deceased countess may yet discover that
they have an interest in the caste and
estate of old Sir Montgomery Ross of
Scotland.
BALLOTS WILL END ALL.
Fates of Candidates and Saloons
Will Be Known Before

Many Pastors Make a Final Plea on
B.'ba f of S loon-Closingâ The
Poling Places.
Oakland Office San* Francisco Call,)
906 Broadway, March 7. )"
The campaign is over and the final but
tonholing and combining closed to-night.
In nearly all the churches the pastors
made earnest exhortations to the congre
gations to do all in their power to lurther
the saloon-cloaing proposition.
At the First Free Baptist Church Rev.
Philip Graif spoke as follows:
History teaches with no uncertain
Eo\irrd that the saloon is one of the peril
ous edges down whose sharp steep descent
are ghastly, indescribable things of poverty
and disgrace, disease and Infamy. Perhaps
the gilded and frescoed drinking place
dues not look at first blush hideuus and
appalling, but a long keen glance behind
is merry screens and bright veneer re
veals a tropic spider which spread itsr-if
cut on its web like a flower ot gorgeous
earb luring the unweary by its famed
beauty and sweetness to pain and death.
Indeed, often worse than asp's sting or
hempen noose, or bullet in trie brain, is the
smoke of torment and the pangs of re
morse, the fret and the fever that come to
those who tread th 6 primrose path of
cailiance. Alas, it is only too well known
that to sow a saloon means a harvest of
feuds and drunken bouts, blasted names
ml broken home?, well- filled jails and
expensive gallows.
Try to invent as many euphuistic
i h rases as we will, the saloon is a potent,
baneful shadow on our civilization ; yea
it wastes like the moth and blights like
the mildew; it smites like thescytheand
gnaws like the undying worm. Talk
about the horrors and desolation of war
or the stalking of pestilence from house
to house in the still night. air! What n
tnat dread power which, though boldly
I seen, is yet cunningly concealed, and in
hut and palace ante is a menace to our
peace and virtue, and swings its ax and lifts
its iconoclastic hammer over the objects
that are most endeared to our affections,
bo that year in and year out it seem? as if
our land were draped in a black pail and
a plague or battle were evermore in
p-o?ress? Ah, gloss and whitewash and
extenuate as we may, the saloon in its best
aneet is more like a dynamite bomb
than anything ejse.
Surely ie noes without saying fhat if it
riere a school ot patriotism anil high
ideals every righ-minded citizen would
hail its open doors and bless its brewed or
disti'led .wares, but as a rule its life is the
deadliest poisonâ its breath of perfume
tills one with shivers of auony, its atmos
phere shrivels and withers everything
pood, true or beautiful, its kj 38 ro bs health
ol its vigor and youth of its comeliness,
its- whisper sounds like a hiss, ai.d its
steady influence means death and destruc
tion.
It is jnst as impossible to hatch a canary
from a scorpum'o egg or get a Â»peckled
trout Irom devilfish spawn as to evolve
noble manhood trom a Fagin's den or a
liquor dosrgery. Yes, it ia easier for a
skiff to outride the white billows of
Niagara's current and shoot down into
the boiling gulf of rock and foam unhurt
than it is for a boy or girl, man or woman,
to pass unscathed on the lurid and thun
derous stream of public drink.
It is too painfully apparent that the
saloon makes right living difficult, if not
absolutely impossible. As a city we want
to cultivate, not what stunts and paral
yzes, but what feeds, enriches and en
nobles the soul, and so long as the saloon
L rules our best civic life is handicapped
I and thwarted. Justaatue marble group
' o: Laocoon in the Vatican gallery at Rome
rppresents a father and his two sons in
the tightening folds of a huge serpent,
which with every movement makes the
anguish of the victims all the shamer
and iheir helpless writhings all the more
pathetic, so with every new strain of the
saloon power the agony of its sufferers
l.as grown intenser and its remorseless
coll and grip more close and terrible.
The hour of uttermost crisis has come,
and the decisive blow must be struck to
free the city Irom this old-tim- fire
dragon and scaly monser. By earne-t
united effort the thing can be done, for
granite walls and iron rods dissolve into
mist before the resolute will. As quickly
can the day be gained as were broken the
green wilnes with which the unshorn
Samson found himself bound. Certainly
just as that one unconquerable soul, David
Livingstone, changed the moral climate of
Africa so a determined group of high
minded citizens can materially transform
our filthy marsh into a wholesome park,
our slouchs of iniquity into schools of vir
tue, our ueserts of vice into oases of hap
piness, the tracks of sin and suffering into
sweet homes of joy and laughter. Who
will not gladly heip at the polling-booth as
well as at parlor meetings or the social
boa-d to turn our else Leautiful city into
something more of a real paradise and
something less of an unadulterated hell?

Miss Parish Fore d to Run Through
a Slouch to E-cap; a Band
of Ru fi ins-
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call, )
9vÃ Broadway, March 7. j
Mr. Parish, one of the oldest ranchers
near Alvarado, is anxious to run across
three tramp 3 who intercepted his daugh
ter a few days ago while walking from the
ranch into lown. The farmer declares
that he will have use for his gun should
be meet these gentlemen.
List Thursday afternoon Miss Hattie
Parish, sister of the school teacher at
Centerville, was on her way to Aivarado
from her home. When about half way
between the two places, she was met by
three tramps. One of them at once ac
costed her and continued the conversation
fjr :i few minutes, trying to make it ap
| pear that he had met Miss Parish at a
mask ball recently given in Aivarado.
The other fellows kept on behind and
linaily the first one asked her if she were
going into town to mak purchases and
suggested that such a journey would
necess ta'e the u-e of money.
Miss Parish had several dollars in her
pur-e, and when her companion reached
this point In the conversation the other
two started to close in around her. Fright
ened to death, she jumped off the railroad
track on which :-he had been walking and
started back toward her home. The
tramps ran after her, but she was so
frightened that she succeeded in leaving
them behind until they came to a plowed
lieid in which was about two feet of mud.
Without hesitating a moment Miss Parish
started to cross the field, every step she
took landing her in mud up to her knees.
One of the tramps followed her half way
across, but tt.en gave up the chase.
The young lady arrived home a few min
utes later in a highly nervous condition
and has since been suffering from prostra
tion. Her father started out with his gun
and, procuring the aid of the constable,
we;itin search of the tramps. As that
part of the country is at present all under
water they could not travel very fast and
the band of villains have not yet been cap
turel.
Mis- Parish is very popular at Center
ville, and it will go hard with the men
who intercepted her should any of her
friends run across them.

STRUCK THE DRAW.
The Olivebank Crushes Heavily Into

OAKLAND, Cal., March 7.â As the
large British ship Olivebank was passing
throuh Webster bridge this alternoon
she struck one side of the draw and did
considerable damage. Tne ship was in
charge of the tugs Reliance and Vigilant,
but tbe draw is so narrowed ana decayed
th~twith the stiff breeze that was blow

the subject from ro-trum and pulpit, cir
culars prepared by Seventh Day Advent
ists have been mailed to every voter and
the local press has chronicled the progress
of the anti-saloon people with a surprising
fullness.
On the other side not a word has been
said, not a public action has been taken.
To all appearances the saloonkeepers
hnve not raised a finder to protect them
selves from being driven out of business.
Of course, such has not been the case.
Men with such a vast amount of capital
at stake as is represented by the saloons
of this ciiy have not quietly stood by and
allowed their opponents to do all the
fighting, Just what they have done will
be determined by to-morrow nig t.
An interesting feature of the saloon issue
is the fact that it has been very studiously
avoided by the candidates in their speeches.
It has been a forbidden topic too delicate
to handle. One candidate has been bold
enough to say that in this mntter he will
be guided by the will of the people, but
the rest nave discussed McKinley, the tar
iff, the Republic and its iour.dation and
the foreign situation, greatly preferring
these high-sounding and perfectly safe
topics to the material matters of what
they would do in certain local crisfS. The
politicians and candidates of Oakland
regard a fight against saloons in toe same
manner as a fox views a hedgehog.
Once again a Gran i Jury is in session,
and, as usual, all kinls of reports of its
doingi are be.nK made public To the
outside world sudi startling reports may
be interesting, but to residents of this
county the Grand Jury is regarded en
tirely in He lij,ht ot an expensive legal
hoax. For tive years past the Grand Jury
room hns b?en made a place where politi
cians, disgruntled from various causes,
sought to ventilate their grievances and
wreak their political vengeance. In many
instances this has resulted in the return
ing ol ponderous batches of indictments
against officials ior all kinds of maifeas
ance in office. Those indictments occupy
many panes of the criminal records of the
county, and that is their alpha and omega.
Judging Dy the result all were b^sed on
the same sort of loundation as the charge
of bribery now agitating the Legislature.
A few came to trial and were in every in
stance dismissed, and the balance have
been forgotten.
A few days ago the Grand Jury was in
advertently made the tool of a few politi
cians for the purpose of influencing me
present campaign. The scheme failed,
and that august body accepted the testi
mony that all it hnd heard was simply a
street corner jocular conversation. No
body fears the Grand Jury, and its indict
ments carry about as much weight as its
semi-annual recommendation that a new
city prison be built. Its "i-eerei" sessions
are a farce, because the proceedings are
published as soon as tuey transpire.
The money of the taxpayers is abso
lutely wasted, because the men who are
required to give their time to iis sessions
are not of the cla-s that work for %Z a day.
A Grand Jury report and a petition to the
Council from Ljwis the Light have exactly
tne same weigtit.
The letter published last week by Pro
fessor Burrill. bend of the language de
pariiuent of the High School, has caused
some deen thinking. Mr. Burrill makes
the sweeping assertion iliat the product
of the eraiiimar school is very unsatisfac
tory when it reaches the Ui^li School and
that this view is shared by nearly all cf
the faculty. As near y a week has gone
by since this statement was made public,
and it han not been contradicted by any
body, it is but reasonable to presume that
it has some foundation in fact.
At this particular time the signed
charges of inefficiency are j articularly
opportune and cannot fail to produce
pood, whether they are true or false. If
true the remedy can be applied in less
than a month af :er to-morrow's election ; if
ialse, the opportunity has arisen to refute
them raid to allay positively rumors that
have been in circulation for two years.
Mr. Burrill more than hints that the
School Department iÂ« deeply in politics.
If this be true, it can be rectified to
morrow, when a new Board of Education
is to be elected which will elect a Superin
tendent of Schools to serve for the next
four years. If toe incumbent, Mr. Mc-
Clymonds, who has held ihe position for
eight years, has pursued his duties with
an eye single to the efficiency oi tne Dublic
schools and does not merit the severe
criticism of Professor Burrill, then he
should be vindicated by re-election. If,
whoever, the faculty of the High School
have not been misrepresented by one of
their number, it would appear that a
change would De beneficial.
In any event, the School Board to be
elected to-morrow has a mo3t important
duty to perlorm. The present system of
education is either ereatly at fault or it
has been gro3slv slandered, and on the
School Directors rests tne duty of satisfy
ing the public that their taxes are being
intelligently spent for the purpose of ob
taining the'best result?.

A CLEAN PRIMARY.
Much Interest Manifested In the Good
Government Vote on Saturday.
ALAMEDA. Cal., March 7.â Tne count
of the vote cast yesterday at the primary
of ihe Good Government Club was not
completed until an early hour this morn
ing. The greatest interest was manifested
in this primary to nominate a third city
ticket at the coming election on the 12th
of April. The club has an enrolled mem
bership of about 1700 and 1024 of these
voted on Saturday, being about 175 less
than the number that voted two years
ago, when it was organized, and when
practically it was the only factor in the
election hela then. Saturday's election
was participated in by all alike, being
strictly ir n-partis 'ii. A few attempts
were made at "repeating," but the number
was exceedingly small, and the primary
will go on record as one of the fairest
ever held in Alameda.
The vote was as follows: City Trustees
(two to choose)â Thomas Wnite, 502; E.

GONE UP IN SMOKE.
The Big Hotel at Rodeo Burned to the
Groundâ The Loh Will Reach
530.000.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 7.â The Union
Hotel at Rodeo, about three miles from
Pinole, was burned to the ground to
night. The hotel covered nearly half an
acre and was a 3-story building, built at a
cost of $30,000 about five years ago when
the great abattoir was built. It has not
been inhabited for some time and was
partially furnished. Although great ef
forts were made to save it the lire gained
complete control and could not be
checked. The cause of the fire is un
known.
The hotel was built during the boom at
Rodeo and was never opened. It was a
frame building, and when it once started
to burn it went rapidly. Every one in the
neigh Dorhood was out right ng the flames,
but the wind was too high and water too
scarce and the bui d ng had to io.
The average cost o' men-of-war in
Nelson's time was only Â£66.000 for a large
100-Kun ship. The Magnificent, one of the
latest and finest at present in the British
Navy, cost Â£900,000.

His Neighbors Believ; He Had Docu
ments to Prove His Taleâ la
a Pauper's Grav.\
Lowly lies the head that might have
worn a crown.
No titled courtiers waited rrith bated
breath to learn the condition of the royal
ill one; no masters of medicine battled
grimly with the dark shadow that
hovered, no nation put on its mourning
uarb when the call came; no one shouted,
"The king is dead, long live the king."
He died on a barren hilltop under the
splashing rain, with no one to catch his
dying words but the moaning wind and
his God. There were none to mourn, none
to weep, none to care.
A rough redwood Jbox in a pauper's
grave iÂ« his last testing place, and yet
this man claimed tiie greatest monarch
that Europe ever knew as hia father, and
many there are wno believe his claim to
be just.
Thirty years ago there appeared at Ocean
View a little man whose accent proved
him to be of the land o! sunny France.
Despite his rough attire and applica
tions to the ranchers for menial labor, his
bearing And faultless language proclaimed
him to be an educated gentleman, and
helping iiands were outstretched to aid
him to make a living.
At first he haa little to say of his past,
but as his heart warmed to the children,
who seemed to fancy his company, he
told strange tales of his birthâ that be was
the son of a King, though an outcastfrom
his people.
"Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was my
father," he told little Valentine Wip
fler â now a man grownâ "and I should be
living in luxury, perhaps on a throne, in
stead of leading the life of a common la
borer."
The children retailed the storie? to their
parent", but their elders only laughed
and said '"the old Frenchman was crazy."
As they gradnally came to know him,
however, and learn from his own lips the
tale of his sorrows many grew to believe
him and by common consent he became
known as "Napoleon." I'h-y pitied his
decay el gentility and his mournful eyes.
If he ever pave any other name his
friends have forgotten it and "Napoleon"
he lived and died. For years the old man
lived and toiled for the ranchers, always
pleasant, always courteous, always pains
taking. Then as his strength waned and
his eyos grew dim he was dependent on
hi:i neighbors for charity and came regu
larly for his y>rovi>ionÃ to those he knew
would gladly help him.
A charitable neighbor built him a shanty
below one of the great abandoned quarries
that disfigure the green hills south of
Ocean View, and there he dwelt alone for
a decade. A lew years ago he removed to
an abandoned dwelling above the quarry,
and a fiercely bearded German, also a re
cluse, joined him. Here he died one day
last week. He went out one evening and
did not come back and next day he was
found lying dead by a barbed-wire fence,
against which he had evidently fallen
while trying to return to liis companion.
Tne Coroner of San Mateo County was
notified and tae body was taken to Red
wood City and consigned to a pauper's
grave.
Fred Cuche, a French Swiss, who is en
gaged in the training of hunting dogs and
who lives just below the yawning quarry,
knew "Napoleon" well and believes that
he was the son of Napoloon Bonaparte.
"Some people say the o^d man was in
sane," he said yesterday, "but I know he
was not, for I observed him closely for
years, and he never gave one sign of being
out of his mind.
"Even in his declining years he gave
every evidence of gentle breeding and al
ways showed a fine spirit. His face bore
a most remarkable resemblance to the
portraits of Napoleon, and many times he
has told me of ihe manner m wh eh he
was separated from his mother and royal
father.
"He stated that the woman who bore
him was one of the many on whom Napo
k>on cast his smiles, and that he remained
with her until he was two years old.
"He wa* born in 1810, when his royal
father v.as in the zenith of liis glory, when
he had humbled Austria, taken her terri
tory, outwitted "Weilesley, and by the
treaty of Schonbrunn had brought Europe
to his feet.
"Two years later, when clouds were
gathering over the Emperor's head, his
mother and himself were hurriedly sent to
America, amply provided with funds for
their support. Through all of his varying
fortunes and even during his exile at Elba
Napoleon did not forget his old love and
her child, and the boy's education was
begun by the best tutors procurable.
"Then, when the father fe 1 at Waterloo
and was sent into his final exile, the re
mittances ceased and his mother was
thrown on her own resources. She man
aged with what sne bad saved to give him
a good education, and on her deathbed
placed in his hands documents that proved
his birth.
"These papers the old man had up to a
few years ago, for I saw them more than
once, though I could not get a glimpse of
the inside, merely having his word for
what they contained.
"Somehow he could never make a living
except as a laborer. He fai;ed as a teacher
and as a clerk owin to his high spirit,
soon losing a, position after he gained it,
and he finally adopted the life of a work
liijrmaD."
Valentine Wipfler remembered the same
story as related by "Napoleon, 1 ' and once
-tailed to write the old man's history at
li.s dictation, but the tasE was interrupted
and never finished. The portion written
has been lost.

908 Broadway, MarcU 7. )
Frank A. Leach, proprietor of the Oak
land Enquirer, received a dispÃtch to
night stating that he is to be the next
Superintendent of the United States Mint
at San Francisco.
The dispatch read?:
Hon. Frank A. L>-ach, Oakland, Cat.: The en
tire delegation agreed upon you lor Superin
tendent ot the United States Mint Accept
congratulations. oi Hamilton and myself.
Frank McLalghlin.
A few minutes after receiving the above
dispatch Mr. Leach received the follow
ing:
Hon. Frank A. Leach: You will be tendered
the superiuiendency of the Mint. I earnestly
entreat that you accept the position.
8. G. Hilborn.
Mr. Leach said to-night that the news
was a great surprise to him. He has not
been a candidate for that position or any
other. A few days ago he received a con
fidential dispatch from a prominent Re
publican at Wasniugton advising him that
the delegation would tender him the
place and urgently urging him to accede
to the wishes of the delegation. Some of
the newspapers of the interior part of the
btate bavins incluied Mr. Leach's name
in the list of those who migtu be chosen
for the Mint, he wrote Mr. Hilborn a few
weeks ago to pay no attention to any re
ports he might hear or rend; that he was
not a candidate for the Mint or any po
sition, consequently he is unable to ac
count for the action of the delegation.
Mr. Leach has always been a warm sup
porter of the Republican party, and his
newspaper has made a very active cam
paign on behalf of Senator Perkins and
Congressman Hilborn. He has been in
journalism for many years, and came to
Oakland about twelve years ago iroin
Vallejo. He is a native of flew York
State and is 50 years of age.
"I knew nothing of this thing until a
few days ago," said Mr. Leach to-night.
"I was then informed that my name was
being presented, and to-night the dis
patches told me of the result of the efforts
of my friends. I have already received
many congratulations, and one of the
heartiest was from George Morrow, who
waÂ« making an open fight for the place. I
have received several congratulatory tele
grams from several places, and 1 feel par
ticularly gratified at the manner in which
the choice was made and tendered. If the
President offers me the position I shall
certainly accept. "
AT THE THEATERS.
A Number of Attractions Are Offered
to Those Who Wish to Visit the
Playhouses To-Night.
James A. Herne commences the third week

A Burglar In a L,odging-Ho*se on
O'Farrell Street Surprised While
Picking a Lock.
A bnrglar eot into the lodging-house,
235 O'Farrell street, Saturday night and
made his way to the second floor where
he attempted to open the door of one of
the rooms with a pcklock.
A young woman who occupies the ad
joining room heara the noise made by the
picklock and quietly opened her door.
She saw the burglar at work and asked
him what be was doinir. With an oath
he growled out, "Wfiat'a that to you," and
springing at her grasped her by the throat
with both hands. She screame.l and
dashing her from him he ran downstairs
and made his escape.
The police were notified and they be
lieve he is tue same man that broke into

ASA HSK AT BEST.
Funeral Services Held, at His L>atÂ«
Residence.
The impressive funeral services were
held over the remains of Asa Fi3k at his
late jesidence, 700 Hayes street, yesterday
afternoon by the Key. Emil Berger.
Surrounding the bier were many of the
friends of the deceased who came to pay
their last tribute of respect to Im memory
and to the surviving members of his
family.
The Rev. Mr. Berger, after the religious
portion of the service had been performed,
SDoke of his acquaintance of the deceased
ps a constant attendant at the Westmin
ster Presbyterian Church on Fell street
prior to bis (Mr. Berger's) removal to an
Eastern charge.
He found the deceased to be a man
whose word was his bond, and in this
quality he expected those with whom he
had dealings to live up to the same stand
ard. Though having the reputation of
driving hard bargains, yet he was charit
able and possessed some excellent traits of
character.
His remains were interred in the Ma
sonic Cemetery. It is said that by his
will, what was left of bis estate, which
will amount to about $100,000, has been
divided between his three children, and
that he conveyed the greater portion of
his real estate outside of this City and
Alameda County to his wife some time
previous to his death.

He stated that there was no rea-on for

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
All Surroundings and Indi
cations Favor Approach
ing Activity.
Some Important Transactions in
Realty Consummated Dur
ing the Week.
Many Large Acreage Tracts Have Been
SubJivided Recently Through*
cut the State.
The new administration, the certainty of an
extra session of Congress within a fortnight
and the promise of a new tariff at an early
day, which shall provide adequate revenue
and protection, have iloue much to stimulate
a better feeling in trade circles and increase
confidence in tne near approach of an improve
ment in business
The wet weather which prevailed during the
past week was uot favorable for the transac
tion of business in any line, especially in that
of real estate. But rain is a good thing for all
State aud local interests, and helps to
strengthen confidence in realty as well as In
everything else. Sunshine has now returned,
and "existing conditions are such as to cause
operators and dealers in property matters to
feel notably cheerful in regard to the future,
activity being generally expected in season
able time.
The real-estate Horizon is bright. Sunshine
is seen in every direction, causing cheeriul
ness among holders of property and giving
hope not only that better times are at hand
generally but also that a season of marked
activity in realty transactions is approaching.
Ail nirroundings and indications favor such
impressions. At the same time there is no
boom feeling apparent. In fact, there seems
to be a unanimous opinion that any attempt
at inflation of values would be wrong as well
as a failur;, because there is nothing 'o justify
such movement. Of course, during the past
two or three years there have been some
bargain sale.*, owing to unsettled conditions,
and buyers of such properties will be the
richer as mutters become more settled and
business moves along in more normal fashion.
The majority of the prominent real estate
brokers in the City have expressed themselves
as not favoring the remedy proposed by the
Board ot Trade to do away with the fraudulent
immigration schemes which have done so
much damage to the name 01 California. The
brokers claim that the appointment of a com
mission to pass upon colonizing projects and
list them according to their merits would be a
diflicult matter.
Their objections to this proposed commission
are numerous and convincing. They say such
a body would add to the patronage and might
become, through its direct bearing upon the
â welfare of great lanaed interests, a re'adv in
strument in unscrupulous hands of levying
campaign blackmail. They also assert that
such a commission might be induced to recom
mend projects thut ought to have no standing.
"Give a body of practical politicians on one
side empowered to kill a business or make it
boom," said a representative realty broker,
"and a rich corporation on the other, the
saiety of whose investments would depend on
such a boom, and what might not come to
pass?"
There are men in California who live on
what they can make from greenhorns and
this, of course, is to be regretted. Bad as the
disease if, however, the remedy suggested by
the Board of Trade seems to be worse.
During the past week some important trans- |
actions have been effected in local realty. One
of these was the sale of the fifty-vara lot on
the southeast corner of Sacramento and Hyde
streets on which are eight two-story dwellings
and a cottage. John Hinkle was the seller,
but the purchaser's naino has not yet been
made known. T.ie price paid, however, as re
ported by Baldwin & Uowell, the agents, is
$50,000.
Another important transfer was the sale 01
80 feet, lot on the north line of Sutler street,
120 feet east of Van Ness avenue, running:
through to Fern avenue, for $30,000. Dr. Mc-
Nutt is the purchaser and Colonel Crocker the
seller. Shainwaid <Â£ Buckbee, ihe agents in
the transaction, report that the doctor in
tends to move his California-street house to
bis new purchase and to make several im
provements in addition that will add greatly
to the appearance of the place.

PROHPEROVS AND I'KOGRF.SSIVE WINTERS.
Reference has been made in these columns
frequently of late to the encouraging fact that
tlu? settlor in California has no difficulty now
in securing choice land iv small tracts. It is
only a few years since one of thechief ob
stacles to immigration to this State was the
difficulty of procuring small farms of desirable
land in good localities. All is changed now.
Bone of the largest tracts have been divided
tip and colonized; others are now being sold
off.
Notable among the largo holdings which
have been placed on the market in small
tracts during the last year or two Is the
Wolfskill grant near the town of Winters.
During the past three years, or since the prop
erty was put on the market, 5085 acres of the
grant h .vo been sold, umou::une in all to
$515,300.
The McMahan subdivision of the Wolfskill
grant, â which comprises some of the finest
farming land in the State, is probably the
most thickly settled of ail the grants, with a
lot of thrifty and industrious farmers, many
of whom have added greatly to their posses
sions with costly Improvement!. Â«
The sale of this proierty has probably
proven the mont successful of any large hold
ing that has been subdivided and placed on
the market during the past year or two.
The great drawback to some sections of the
Slate has been the inability to obtain good
land at anything like a reasonable price.
The Sacramento Valley, in the territory sur
rounding Winters, bursts upon the vision of
the weary traveler, alter crossing tne arid
plains of Southern Caiiiornia, as a land of
wonder and beauty, and the problem presents
itself, why is nature so partial in the distribu
tion of her gilts? Not many towns in this or
any other State can truthfully claim tne
natural advantages that Winters and its en
virons can. More so, perhaps, than many other
places in the Sacramento Valley, Winters en
joys a climate as serene as a dream of luxury;
serene in that it is robbed of all severityâ
balmy, bright and tranquil as a summer's sea.
The domain of winter is met on the moun
tain slopes, where its ad van cc is stayed by the
greetings of perpetual summer. Above the
hoary garmeiiis of the frost king shroud the
monarchs and carpet, with its icy breath, peak
and plateau, cove and canyon. But beneath
lies the pretty town of Winters in the smiling
valley of tho Sacramento, carpeted with em
erald and bespangled w.th flowerc Here
wherever the eye is directed a new charm ap
pears, anew delight is present, and the soft
a.r, iaden with fragrant odors, with a mere
suggestion of the sea, is as a balm to the lungs.
'i nere is no more beautilul landscape in all
the country than this garden spot, wncre the
eye reaches out over thousands of broad acres
oi luxuriant orchards and vineyards, and the
orange with its load of golden fruit, the olive
with its silvery sheen, the magnolia with its
waxen leaves, tne cypress with its burden of
verdure, the stately paw, the occasional sturdy
onk, the intervals oi waving grain, each a de
light in itself, and all adding their shades of
color under a cloudless sky, save perchance a
few white fleeces stealing away to hide i;i soma
nook In the mountains that rise majes'.ically
in their garb of many shndes of green, con
tributing greater charms and magnificent |
relief to tho landscaje.
While the general contour presented by the |
va'lcy is that of a level plain, it is in lact a I
series of gentle undulations, with marked
variations in the quality of the soil.
Of the varied productions of the portion of
the valley in question it is diflicult to speak in
terms which shall not savor of exaggeration.
The question is no longer what can, but what
cannot, be successfully grown here.
The essential peculiarities of the climate
consist in the uniformity of temperature and
humidity and the distribution of rain. The
temperature varies but little, winter or sum
mer. In no winter Is the aver ge temperature
below 40 degrees, nor does it rise in summer
above 60. The effect oi the first rains is magi
cal.
The dust is washed from the foliage and is
laid in the roads and fields. The air has a
ireah sparkle and liie. The skies are a deeper !
azure, and the soft, green hills seem nearer j
and fairer than before. It is the Indian sum- |
mer of the East, but instead of the soft lassi
tude of the dying year it comes with all the
freshness and v.gor of the new-born spring.
It is at ti.is season that the grass springs up
on every hand, and the self-sown grain in all
the fields. The hills change to a brighter
green. Wild flowers appear in every sheltered
nook. Hyacinths and crocuses bloom in the
gardens, and the perfume of the violet is
everywhere in the air.
It Is not difficult to estimate the value of
fertilizing rains aud the wonderful forces of
nature that gently distill the w ater from the
salt ocean, carrying it in marvelous ethereal
vauurs and distribute it so gently that not
even the most delicate petal is disarranged.
All the little plants hold up their tiny mouths
and receive their fill. The great oaks, mon
archs of the hills for a thousand years, are ell
supplied. A thousand springs and streams
are Â»et to running and become the source of
life and beauty.
Not all the earth is so blessed as this section
of California is. There are vast acres where
no rain falls, or in such scanty measure and
at such long intervals as to be practically use
less. Once in years of time a few clouds wan
dering over a strange land drop a gentle
shower, as if weei icg over the desola
tion, or as if incensed with the circumstances
that interfere with the gentle rains, assemble
like a vast army and pour out their treasure
in such a flood that ail the labor of years is
swept away.
In latter years it has become quite fashion
able to descant about the advantages of ajdry
country with irrigating canals. Too many,
however, underrating the advantages of
timely rains, make their home in a cactus
desert.
Summarizing, It may be said that in any
part of the year days too hot or too cold for
the comfort of those engaged in ordinary vo- I
cations are unknown in the Winters district.
The fears and forebodings with which tne sea- |
â ona are elsewhere greeted are here unheard I
of. Coming with no rigor, the/ bring no ter
rors, and are alike welcomed by all, not as a
relief, but as a change.
In these conditions health and personal com
fort are largely subserved, and also in them
the horticultural pos^bilities, of which we are
to-day upon the threshold, arc assured; and
these, me elements of present and of pros
pective prosperity, are as constant as tlia
ocean currents la which they have their
origin and as p?rmanent as the mountain
ranges wnich bound the field of their exhibi
tion.
The estimation of the people of Winters re- j
zarding the climate ot their section of the
State has been ihe theme of much facetious
comment. In view of the fact that elsewhere
those who are able to spend half tiie year on
the St. Lawrence, or on the coast of Maine, to
escape the heat of summer, and the other half
in Cuba, Florida or on the shores of the j
Mediterranean, to avoid the rigors of winter; I
that, in fact, most of their lives are mlgra- j
tions in search of climate the residents of this I
State may accept with equanimity the badin !
age of these birds of passage, aud may well I
felicitate themselves upon those conditions
that bring to their very door the summer of
the Thousand Isles and the winter of the An
tilles.

street from Foisom street to Potrero avenue
are from two to six inches above the roadway
and make the street dangerous for traffic and
pedestrians, and the rain has turned the
macadam on the street into red mud and
SiUsh. The property-owners have petitioned
the railroad company to remove their unused
tracks that they may repave the street, but
the company has refused thus far to do so.
The northern and western suburbs of the
City are at present in course of evolution. The
Fair i-xteiision on the north side of the City is
being pushed aluiid and when completed will
add at least 100 acres to the habitable part
of San Francisco. Work on the old Bay Dis
trict racetrack on D street, beyond the Odd
Fellows' Cemetery, is progressing, and before
much longer will no doubt be covered with
homes.
The experience of the property-owners in
the San Miguel Rancho in fighting the HOe
heirs in their recent claim to a large portion
of the territory promoted them to introduce
the bill in the Legislature compelling any
person who brings a suit to quiet title to give
a bond for costs and for the passage of which
they are fighting hard that it may become s
law. The Noo heirs sought to dispossess over
6.i00 people of their homes after being in
possession for many years. Tho property
owners have decided to prevent the bringing
of such suits in future if possible.
The members of the L.-gislature outside of
San Francisco, it is said, ooject to the bill on
the ground that it would make it very incon
venient and expensive to those who desire to
bring bona-fide suits to remove clouds from
titles or tiually settle estates, which is often
done by action to quiet title.
Considerab'e damage has been occasioned
by the recent storm to the streets that have
been graded and macadamized in the neigh
borhood of Ninth avenue and J street. Ap
peals have been mnde by the property-owners
to the Supervisors praying for relief, which oc
casioned a visit by Mayor Phelan to the dis
trict during the past week. Sewers are needed
in many places, but owing to the uncertain
status of the recent survey of the district no
sewer has been constructed.
City officials that paid a visit to the district
were eager to save the streets accepted by the
City, but were confronted with the fact that a
sÂ»wer must be built to accomplish their design.
At the next meeting of the Street Committee
of the Board of Supervisors the schema for a
sewer system in the district will be discussed.

George A. Raymond, who has been well

Francisco for many years, has lormed a con

manager of their country land department,
W. G.Griffith has given up his position with
the firm.
Near the town of Famosa, in Kern County,
several owners of large tracts of land adjoin
ing er.ch other have united in a corporation
and adopted a rather novel plan for the im
provement and sa c of their property.
The prime otject of this association is for
the purpose of uniting their interests in one
large body and cultivating as a wnole the land
in question, subdividing it into small tracts
ana then selling it ott' in subdivisions of a few
acres each. While of unu ual advantage to
all of tne individual investors, it is probably
more so to the grocers in the offer made for
the handling aud preserving of fruit.
While the land is soM outright the purchaser
has the privilege of having it taken care oi
nnd the fruit harvested and preserved by the
association, of which body he becomes a mem
ber upon tho purchase of his tract. In this
way for the retailer, the expense of the
grower, the canner and the wholesaler will,
when figured out, show a Dig saving over the
usual costs of canned goods.
The uniqueness of the plan of operation of
this association is that all fruit grown on the
tract by the different owners is preserved be
fore shipment by canning and drying pro
cesses. An experienced fruit canner and or
chardist lirs been placed in charge of the
preservatory and orchards nowp anted, about
500 acres. By this method the owners secure
the combined growers' and canners' profits
for their own bent fit. and non-resident own
ers have the same advantages of cheapened
cost of production as though the land were
under their own supervision.

A FEUD THAT
ENDED FATALLY
Policeman George Dough
erty Murders H. E.
Sullivan.
He Sends a Bullet Through the
Heart of His Long-Hated
Euemy.
The Officer Makes an Attempt to Enl
His Own Life md Is Badly
Wounded.
Murder, as far as is known unprovoked
and cowardly, was comm tted in Edward
Lunstedt's saloon, corner of Powell and
O'Farrell streets, at an early hour this
morning.
H. E. Sullivan, a barkeeper employed in
Boyle's saloon in the Po'.rero, who resided
at 11Q6}4 Tennessee street, was shot dead
by George Dougherty, a police officer
of the Southern statfon squad, and the
murderer then turned the death-inflicting
weapon on himself and made a desperate
attempt to end his own life, but in this he
tailed.
Sullivan, the murdered man, and
Dougherty, his slayer, accompanied by
several friends, entered the saloon in
which the tragedy took place about mid
night.
According to the proprietor of the
house, Mr. Lunstedt, the principals in
the unfortunate affair began to scuffle
and wrestle around the barroom.
They finally tired of the diversion, how
ever, and Sullivan left his companion and
entered one of the rear rooms of the sa
loon.
He re-entered the bar-room a little later,
and instead of resuming the scuffle en
tered into a controversy with Dougherty.
Ibe conversation became exciting and
noisy.
Lunsiedt finally cautioned the men to
modulate their voices.
This was not done, and suddenly, and
without warning, Dougherty sprang back,
and facing Sullivan, who was leaning
against t^e bar, drew a revolver and
fired.
The bullet went straight to its mark,
and a crimson splash from Sullivan's left
breast showed the bull t's entering place.
Sullivan grasped the bar rail with both
hands, turned an ashy color, and slowly
sank *o the floor.
Just as he lay back dead a second shot
sounded and Dougherty was seen to have
fired another at his victim.
Tins, however, was unnecessary. The
tir-t l<>aden missile had done its work,
Sullivan was dead.
Dougherty then fired another shot, in
tending to pierce his own brain.
The bullet entered at the right side of
his nose, crashed through that organ,
ranged to the left and fractured the sku.l
over the right eye.
The policeman reeled back and dropped
the revolver. The blood was spurting from
his face, and he was about to leave the
taloon when Officers B. Harter and Hay
den, who heard tne shots, entered the
plac and placed him under arrest.
He wa* hurried to the Receiving Hos
pital for treatment. Dr. Thompson, who
removed the bullet, which remained
imbedded in the frontal bone, pronounced
the wound dangerous, but not necessarily
fatal.
Sullivan's body was removed to the
Morgue.
James Boyle, a frier:d of the murdered
man, who witnessed the shooting affray,
was taken into custody.
He s-tatea that the two men bad been
enemies for a long time and that the
friends of both have been expecting
f-erious trouble between them for some
time.
STABBED HIS EMPLOYE.
Captain Wiloou, a Road-House Pro
prietor, Fatally Injures His
Barkeeper.
During an altercation last night, Cap
tain Wilson, proprietor of the Golden
City House, a well-known San Bruno road
resort, stabbed his barkeeper, Arthur
Me.drum, in the neck and abdomen.
It was thought that the barkeeper was
fatal. y injured.
Just how the trouble that culminated
in the stabbing affray started is not
known. The principals had always been
friends and it is presumed that liquor is in
a large measure responsible for what may
prove to b n a murder.
The police at the Seventeenth-street vo
lice station were notified of the cutting
pnd a wagon was sent to the road house tv
remove the injured man to the hospital.
Wilson could not be found by the police
when they reached the scene of the
crime, and it is presumed that he intends
leaving the City. He is described as
being a man 45 years of age, 5 feet 8 inches
tall, sandy in complexion and wears a
small, light mustache.
INSULTED YOUNG LADIES.
Klias Inompoon, a Sailor, Arrested by-
Two Young Men.
F.ilai Thompson, a sailor, 30 years of
nge. was b ioked at the City Prison late
Saturday night on a charge of disturbing
the peace, but a more senoas charge
should have been placed aeninst him.
Thompson was in the Tivoli Saturday
nigbt, and his act oni attracted the atirn
lion of two young mÂ»n, E lward Wands of
440 Thirteenth street and \V. H. Smith o!
418 Tliirieenth street. They watched him
narrowly, and observed that two or three
young ladies that be sat beside moved
away from him. They politely asked one
of them what was the matter and sue said
the man had grossly insulted her.
When he left t c Tivoli they followed
him, and on a Market-street car be in
sulted another young girl, and when she
left iftf car he attempted to follow her.
Then the two voting men interfere! and
arrested the man and turned him over to
the police. They say they will appear in
court and prosecute him.
BOVTH O)f ,II A HLOCK BURN En.
liente Smoke From Tons of Tobacco
'I' Hinder* thÂ» Firemen.
OMAHA. Nebr.. March 7.â The Pioneer
block at South Omaha, one of the most
substantial business blocks there, burned
to the ground this morning. The fire
originated from some unknown source in
the boiler-room and gradually worked its
way into the large storerooms in the base
ment. â¢ In one of these was stored several
thousand pounds of leaf tobacco. .The
fire had gained much headway before dis
covered, and the dense smoke caused by
the burnine of the bales of tobacco hin
dered the tiremen in their work. The loss
cannot at present be carefully estimated,
bu will probably be somewhat leas than
Â£20,000, partially insured.

THEY COULDN'T STAND IT.
Hearst's New York "Journal" No Longer Soils Mechanics'
Library Files*
W. K. Hearst's weekly package of fi:tb, the New York Sunday Journal, has been kicked out of the reading-room of the Me
chanics' Institute because of its vlleness, and the Sunday edition of the New York World, the only great competitor of the Jour
nal in the field of "-ensational depravity, has been kicked out with it.
The authorities of the institution, who are resnonsib c for its decency and its moral tone, as well as for its popularity, de
cided to remove these banefu! monstrosities of journalism three weeks or so aeo. Since then the largely patronized reading-room
has presented a restored sense of cleanness to those members who demand and appreciate the purity and respectability which be
longs to a great library intended to minister to the intellectual and moral natures of men, women and especially of the yontn of
our City.
This action is interesting and significant, not so much as affording further evidence of the universal estimate of the Hearst
journalism among people of respectability and intelligence, but because it is another evidence of the fact that the revolt against
the excesses of the -'new journalism" is general, is crowing and is taking a most effective form. The Mechanics' Institute h:s
simply placed itself in line with other libraries and other moral forces throughout the country, though its action has been taken
with discreet quietness and in the exercise of a cool and calm judgment.
The Mechanics' Library is a big, prosperous and progressive one. It has over 4000 members, and these represent the intelli
gence and respectability of the best clas es of this community. When all the reading members of the families represented are
considered the number enjoying the benefits of the library is greatly increased. It is practically a public library, and it rills a
large place in the intellectual life of the City. Being dependent on the small fees of its members for its prosperity it iÂ» managed,
like other association libraries, with a view to securing new members and to retaining those it has. To do this its utmost re
sources are used to supply its members with what they want, with the newest publications and with the widest range of books
and periodicals. Its reading-room is large and offes the largest list of periodicals to be found in any readine-room in the City. It
is particularly well supplied with the leading newspapers of the United States and the rest of the world. Nearly all the important
New York dailies are on its tables. But the Police Gazette is not on its riles and neither is the Journa'.
That such an institution should deliberately remove theÂ«e two "greit" Sunday papers from its lists is a noteworthy blow in
behalf of public and journalistic decency. It was deeded to allow the week-day issues of the Journal and the World to remain,
but the Sunday issues, with their lurid falces obscenities and page descriptions of human depravity, are birred The members
may find the Sunday issues of the Herald, Tribune, Sun, Times and other respectable New York dailies in their proper place on
the file-*, but when one turns the files of the Journal and the World he pisses from Saturday 'o Monday, and the skip is eloquent.
It could not be expected that Hearst's other sluice for filth and fake-, the Examiner, would be excluded, because the
Mechanics' Library is not at the safe distance of the Portland Public Library, which naa just turned the Examiner out because
of its vileness.
The Portland Librnry is not the only one that will have no paper of the Examiner type. The Public Library of Newark,
N. J., hus done as hasthÂ« Mechanics' Library, and has refused to give room to the Journal or the World.
Of this action the New York Sun *ay : "Because in the opinion of the trustees of the Newark Free Public Library, the
New York World and t c New York Journal are a menace to public morals and too vile for respectable people to read, the library
trustees, at their r-gular monthly meeting, on February 4, decided by a unanimous vote that the Â»Ã¼b->criptions to these news
papers be immediately discontinued, and that the files of the papers on hand be removed from the library reading-room.
"This is a distinct triumph for the new journalism, and one that its most enthusiastic supporters never dared to hope for.
Besides this its latest success, all its past glorious achievements in 'faking,' in keyhole reporting, in the bla-tins; of reputations
and in the ruin of homes fall into insi?niticance. It must, however, be extremely humiliating to the proprietor of the older
product of the new journalism that he is compelled to share this triumph with the proprietor of his younger and only competi
tor. Strive as he would for a 'beat,' he must acknowledge at last that his younger rival has played him a draw in his own game."
Willie Hearst will probably not be at all worried because the Mechanics' Library has cut off a two dollar a year subscription,
nor will he blush because in the home of his youth his "triumph of journalsim" has been spurned by a library association of
decent peop c as too vile for a public reading-room.

a Fire.
Members of His Union Gave
Him a Lilt on Their
Day Off
A Bit of Practical Fraternity by Which
the Mechan c Is Enabled to Be
come a H r usehdler.
The throngs of people who rode on the
electric-cars out the road to Ingleside yes
terday were struck with a rather novel
spectacle for Sunday. It was a big gang
of men at work bunding a house.
In times like these, when the army of
the unemployed keeps growing and no
mechanic of any trade may be found who
complains that there is more work on
hand than can be done in the six days of
the weet, the sight of a small army of
carpenters hammering and sawing and
DUtting uprights and crosspieces in place
as though their future depended on their
completing the building in one day was
sufficient to cause many wondering eyes
to be turned their way as the crowded
cars sped past them.
The fact is the men were working thus
industriously without pay. They were
putting in ibeir holiday building a house
for Louis Metier, one of their fellows, of
Carpenters' Union 483.
Louis Metter was burned out about a
month ago â burned completely out, es
caping in the niuht with scarcely his
clothe^ his wife and children barely get
ting away in safety, lie losing even his
loois and the wife the books she most val
ued. It was in the fire of about a month
ago which destroyed several cottages on
Francis street.
Metier moved with his family into a
cottage on Paris street, which he hap
pened to find furnished and io let, ony a
few blocks away. It so happens that he
had bouuht a lot oi Croke street in the
same neighborhood, and was in position
therefore to secure materials for the build
ing of a small house. This was enough.
The members of his union hearing of the
disaster that had come upon him and of
his necessity volunteered to come to his
as-istance. He ordered the stuff and they
kept their word. Sunday a week ago they
put in the first uprights and yesterday

evening the house was In a fair way
toward completion. For the men only
work on Sundays, understand, the day
that is their own, to enjoy in their own
wav or cive to a friend, as they see fit.
The wet weather and muddy roalsof
the vicinity has hindered the work some
what, but it has gone on with great spÂ°ed
nevertheless. Yesterday there were nt
work in the house-raising party D. N. V.
Roberts, J. C. Heymer, Joe Colabell, Fred
Steen, Jim N lson, August Anderson, Bob
Inglee, J. Hutchin^on, H. Hiigerman and
Lewis Gordon, all members of Carpenters'
Union 483.
It was in truth an oHfashioned house
raisinÂ«r. They began briaht and early and
worked speedily and cheerfully until
noon. Then the call to dinner was
sounded. They knocked off and adjourned
in a body to Metter's house, where Mrs.
Metter had prepared for them a savory
and substantial dinner, which she, with
the assistance of her little daughter,
served, the affair having all the merry
goodfellowship at a picnic.
Another Sunday will probably see the
little house completed, and, after the
painters and ul umbers have gotten
throuph. the Metters will be able to move
in and declare as a fact that they are liv
ing in their own house.
"It is not an unusual thing." s^id Mr,
Metter yesterday, "lor the members of a
union to help each other in this way. I
know of more than a dozen instances
where the houses of mechanics have been
huilt without any cost to them for labor.
M*n are thus enabled to live in their own
homes who could possibly never save
money enough to build them otherwise. I
had a little money saved, but waÂ« com
pelled to borrow a couple of bundled dol
lars besides to buy my lumber. This
policy of mutual assistance is by no means
confined to the caipenters' unions. The
painters often do their share in the same
way, and the plumbers also. It is really
a big thing for the mechanic, and it is
notable that the men volunteer with the
greatest willinenes c ."
SOCIALISTS _IN_THE COUNTRY.
Speakers Will Be Sent Out to Spread
Socialistic Doctrines.
On the opening of the spring, or at least
as soon as the weather becomes set
tlpd, the Socialist labor party will
send a wagon or a van into the country
for the purpose of spreading the teaching?
of Socialism. The money is already
collected for this work and a large
quantity ul literature on matters of politi
cal economy and Socialism is being gath
ered for free distribution from the van.
Several well informed speakers will travel
in tne vehicle from place to place and de
liver addresses and riistribuie reading
matter wherever they can rind people
willing to be enlightened. It is believed
that the party will start south Irom here.
Last year a wagon wns sent along the
northern route and much pi ogress was
made in making converts to socialism.
In fact several branches were started in
the towns north of this city, and reports
show that these new bodies are gaining in
numbers and prominence.
The socialists of this City have on hand
preparation? for two celebrations. The
first is that of the Paris Commune, which
will be held at 115 lurk street on the 18th
:ust. ; the other is the celebration of Inter
national Labor day, on May 1. While a
number of nations have their national la
bor day, the socialists of the world set
aside as their labor day May 1.
In this City the day will be celebrated
in Metropolitan Temple. A committee
consisting of George Speed, Â£L D Kings
ley, T. M. Anthony, William Costley and
Mr. Beresford lias been appointed, with
full power to make all the necessary ar
rangements.
Washington Hall, at 35 Eddy street,
was tilled to the doors last evening, the
occasion being the regular educational
meeting of American R-anch. The
speaker, John H. Marble, delivered a very
entertaining, eloquent anÂ«i Instructive ad
dress on "Individualism." Next Sunday
night 11. W. Wilkins will speak on "Lights
and Shadows."

DASHED DOWN TO
THE PAVEMENT
Little Mary Arata Tumbles
Out of a Second-Story
Window.
The T;ny Maid Sustains Severe
and Dangerous Internal
Ir juries.
Misfortunes Do Not Come Singly to
the Alflxtcd Arata
Household.
Little Mary Arata, aged 4 years, t >m
b'ed out of a second-story window at her
home, 718 Montgomery avenue, yesterday
afternoon, sustaining severe Â«nd danger
ous internal injuries. Propped up amid
the pillows in a hugo four-pcsier the little
raaiil lies, looking all the more tiny on
account of her proportionately bie sur
roun lings. She seetus unable to explain
how the accilent happened or wnere she
suffers rain. Her poor little face is white
and drawn, her large, soft brown Â«Â»yts half
closed, and the only sign of life she gives
Lit le Mary Arata, 4 Years Old,
Who Tumb ed Out c f a Second-
Story Window at Her Home on
Montgomery Avenue and Was
Not Instantly Killed.
is to toss her thin little brown arms to
and fro and to groan regularly and cease
iess!y.
Little Mary is the daughter of S. Arata,
a juuk man, and is one of a family of four.
Her eldest brother is 7 years old, and
over her little baby sister's head nine
short months heve just parsed.
For the past year misfortunes have over
taken the Araia household. First, sick
ness vi-ited the head of the house, and
now the sad reality of being one of the
great army of unemployed stares the poor
breadwinner in the face.
"We had just finished our dinner to-day
wDen the accident happened," said the
mother of the little sufferer. "I was clean
ins; off the table and my husband was sit
ting leisurely by, smoking his pipe. Lit
tle Mary was not a moment out of the
room, in fact I had not y t misled her,
when we heard a terrible scream, and be
fore we could realize what bod happened
two kind neighbors were bringing our un
conscious little girl into the room."
Clutched tightly in the hand of the child
was a rope whicli she nad been dandling
out of the bedroom window when she fell.
That little Mary did not meet with in
stant death is probably due to the fact
that in failing she struck the iron railing
of a cellar that leads off from the street,
directly below the window from which
she fell.
Dr. A. de Lucis was called to attend the
child. The doctoi's diagnosis is to the
effect that little Mary is suffering from
internal injuries, the full extent of which
he has not been able to determine. She
suffered a contusion of the stomach and
liver and had several stomach hemor
rhages during the day. No bones were
Droicen, however, and although the little
girl is dangerously injured the doctor
thinks that the patient may pull through.
AROUND THÂ£ . IAMOND.
The Alerts Defeat the â -'act a Claras in
a Close Game.
The Alameda Alerts shut out the visitors
from Santa Clara at Central Park yester
day by a score of 2 lo 0.
Both teams gave as tine an exhibition of
baseball as has been played at Central
Park. The ball was freely hit, but the
clever fielding prevented any one reaching
first.
The Alerts scored one of their few runs
in the second. Krug started the inning by
sending a fly to short, which was neatly
taken in Ly Foley. Th?n Foley fumbled
W. Hammond's grounder Â«nd allowed
Hammond to reach first. He then went
to second on Graham's passed ball.
Graham recovered in time to head Hnm
mond off, but Carriea fumbled, the runner
going to lhird, and coming borne a ruin
ute later on McKee's pretty single to
right field. Jacobson struck out, and J.
Hammond hit to second and out, ending
thÂ« inninc.
The Santa Claras played in hard luck.
Time and again they had men on bases,
bin McK.ee would settle down and either
strike the Qatter cut. or the ball would be
liit to third or shortstop, invariably run
ning their own man out.
McKeewasin tine form and kept the
Santa Claras guessing at his curves.
Steffani al-o pitched good ball, but the
Alerts became familiar with his curves
and he was batted freely.
The Santa Claras' fielding was far supe
rior to that of the Alerts. The catching
of foul tips by Graham was one of the
lemures.
Next Sunday the San Francisco Athletic
Club will play the Alerts and a great game
is expectÂ°d.

out of work can obtain employment.
Eighteen women have already placed
their .names on the roll, and a number
have been supplied with places. The sec
retary of the unemployed is prepared to
furnish women for ali kinds of work.
The men spent yesterday in selling
tickets for the big benefit that has been
tendered them by E. D. Leavitt for Tues
day evening at the Auditorium.
Already over 1030 25 and 50 cent tickets
have rteen disposed of, and they hope to
sell 1500 to 2000 more by Tuesday night.
The capacity of the house is about 3000.
Following is a list of those who have of
fered their services for the benefit:
Richards and Rand, Zantrella Brothers, Baby
Lewis . Lorrance Sisters, Matt Keff, Dan Daugh
erty, Julius Korto, Professor Galando, W. T.

considerable sum of money from char
itably inclined people, to sati-fy her most
pressing nee<ls.
There are about 1700 men now enrolled
