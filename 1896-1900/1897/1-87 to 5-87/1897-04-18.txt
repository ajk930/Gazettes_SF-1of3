WAR RAGES AT LAST
BETWEEN GREEKS AND
TURKS ON THE BORDER
Declaration of Hostilities by the
Porte Quickly FoDowed by
Fierce Fighting.
LARISSA, Greece. April 18.â 4 a. m.â
Pierce righting between the two armies
baa been in progress several hours. Under
coyer of the darkness large detachments
Of Turkish troops were thrown forward
against the Greek forces at Mount Anal
ipsis. The Greeks are well fortified and
their resistance has been stubborn.
Repeated assaults by large bodies of
Turkish troops were repulsed with heavy !
* loss, and the Greeks have not abandoned
any of their positions.
The firing began in an effort of the Tur
kish commander to occupy a strategic po
sition several miles in advance of the
Turkish strongholds. It is said the Turks
retired after several assaults had been
made.
A battle is now rasing along the whole
of the Thessalian frontier. To-day's |
general engagement was precipitated by
Friday's engagement near Nezeros. The
Turks attacked a Greek advance post,
wounding a Greek lieutenant and killing '
a corporoal. Desultory firing was con- j
tinued until Saturday noon. It was Â£ crcely >
resumed several hours later. The Greeks
drove the Turks from their positions. The
Greeks then cannonaded the Turks from
Tsamteja, causing great excitement along ;
the whole line. The Turkish commander
then began massing large forces for a
general assault.
LONDON, Ejtg., April 18.â The Observer
has a dispatch from Constantinople, show
ing that the long-threatened war between
Turkey and Greece has at last been offi
j.tial.'jr Jccfared by tiie Porte.
The dispatch, which was sent from Con
stantinople at midnight, says it is de
clared that owing to fresh incursions into
Macedonia by the Greeks war has broken
out between the two countries. It further
says, at the council of Ministers at.Yildiz
Kiosk, Saturday, it was decided to recall
Â° Assim Bey. Turkish Minister at Athens,
â¢nd hand Prince Mavrocord'ato, the Greek
Minister to Turkey, his passports. The
Ministers also resolved to send orders to
Edhem Pasha, Turkish commander-in
chief in Macedonia, to assume the offen
sive.
A circular was addressed last evening to
â¢Ottoman envoys abroad, detailing the
latest events in the Graeco-Turkish dis
pute including last week's invasion of
Macedonia.
The Porte declares that despite the offi
cial denials of the Greek Government
Greek troops took part in the invasion.
The circular expresses a hope that the
powers in a spirit of justice will agree J
that the entire responsibility for war rests |
upon Greece. The circular concludes:
"Turkey has no idea of conquest, and as
fresh proof of her pacific sentiments is
willing to withdraw her troops, if Greece
withdraws hers from the frontier ana from
Crete."
ATHENS, Greece, April 18â Cabi
net has determined to protest against
Turkey's aggressive action to the powers.
' ...... . r
TURKS THE AGGRESSORS.
Creeks In a Position to Declare
They are Only Fighting on
the Defensive.
LONDON, Eng., April 18.â Though the
recalling of the Turkish Minister from
Athens, the dismissal of the Greek Minis
ter from Constantinople, and the ordering
of Edhem Pasha to assume the offensivp,
are all preliminary to a declaration of war,
it does not appear that such a declaration
has been formally made, but there is
not the slightest doubt it will be as soon
as the Sultan can affix bis signature.
It has been contended in various quarters
that the raid by the Greek irregulars into
Macedonia was m;:de for the sole purpose
of forcing the Porte to declare war. Tech
nically, Turkey would be the aggressor,
ana the Greeks will be in a position to de
clare that they are only fighting in defense
of their territory.
TOLD BY CIPHER.
Secretary Sherman Receives a Dis
patch From Minister Terrlll at
Constantinople.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 17.âSec
retary of State filier man received a dis
patch to-nicht from Terrill, Unitea States
Miniiter at Constantinople. The Secre
tary said that while the message was in
deDartment cipher and could not be fully
translated usitil to-morrow, he had no
doubt it contained an official declaration
of war between Turkey and Greece.
The Secretary said hostilities between
Turkey and Greece would not affect the
United Stales. He had before him a pub
lished report of the Siaie Drpariment
Bureau of Statistics, which showed the
trade of the United States and ihe two
countries involved was too small to cause
any embarrassment to the United States.
The annual commerce of the United
States with Turkey in Europe amounted
to about $70,000 only, and with Greece
about $300,000.
Thi-, said the Secretary, included ex
ports and imports, Sherman thought

war, instead of being detrimental to our
business with Turkey and Greece, would
iikely make demands for war material-.
Tba Secretary believed the war would
probably be ended by the interposition of
the powers.
Mustapha Bey, the Turkish Minister,
said to-night that be had received no ad
vice in regard to a declaration of war.
Greece is not represented in Washington.
A State De ] artment official said to-night
that the only question liKely to interest
this Government in the Grapco-Turkiah
war was the right of asylum. Many nat
uralized Americans, former subjects of
Turkey and Greece, had returned to their
native Innds. The arrest of any of these
or their claim of protection v hile taking
refuge in the legation of this country
might cuuse trouble.
TOWARD MONTENEGRO.
There Is a Naw Movement on the
Part of the Turkls.-i Troops
In thQ Field.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turret, April 18.
An unexpected movement of the Turk
ish troops toward the Montenegrin fron
tier has given rise to a report that serious
danger is apprehended in that direction.
A battalion of Albanians was in readi
ness to start for the Greek frontier, but
was suddenly sent 10 Ye/ana on the Mon
tenegrin frontier. Another battalion will
follow.
TIRED OF THE STRAIN.
fII Europe Would Probably Feel
Relieved by a Declaration
of War.
LONDON, Eng., April 17.â Although

tier v serious, liie situation does not yet
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 18, 1897 -THIRTY-TWO PAGES.
NEWSPAPER SQUARE
seem to justify the assertion that war is
inevitable. There appears to be no doubt
the Turks are the nggieasors in the latest
movement, and that their regular troops
began an engagement which occupied a
part of two days and involved the use of
artillery and all the available munitions
of war on both sides. The Turkish ver
sion of the battle i* not yet received, but
the Greek account affirms that the enemy
was route.l and driven back across the
frontier. This episode, whatever may be
the ultimate consequences, typiries an im
portant change in the attitude of both
sides, which is the effect of important
royal Â«nd other influences upon several
powers and upon oflicials.
Greece has shifted the point of greatest
danger from Athens to Constantinople.
Even the Greek populace, according to
the latest dispatches, is beginning to calm
unoer the influence of a more conciliatory
policy of the powers, or rather their ap
parent abandonment of all policy. On
the other hand, the Turks, under the same
influence, have become decidedly warlike
and have finally, with or without author
ity from Yildiz, ventured upon an oi>en
official act of war.
It is no longer a secretâ unhappily, in
fact, it ia not denied In Berlinâ that the
German Eruperor is Instigating the Bultan
to war. This is a most discouraging fea
ture of the situation. It is not altogether
hopeless, however. To-day's provocation
in Macedonia, had it occurred a fortnight
or even a week ago, would without ques
t on have been followed by general fight
ing along the whole frontier, but now
Greece will probably hesitate before
launching an official declaration of war,
which would cancel all secret potential
efforts for peace which have been exerted
the past few days.
; All Europe has grown tirtd of the strain
of the crisis, wbioh has 'lost pictur^sque
neii and become only a blind game of
diplomacy.
GREEK STRATEGY.
Movements Which Have Placed the
Turks at a Marked Dis
advantage.
The movement* of the insurgent raiders
bo far show that they are acting according
to well-laid pinna and under the direction
of leaders who understand something of
military strategy. The first strike across
tn* frontier to Krania cut off direct com
munication with Janina and hp.rus and
pnt them in command of the only road
for wheeled vehicles leading into Macedo
ni:t. Advancing alone this road they have
seized in succession Kipuro, Baltino, Pig
nditz i, Sitovon, Kritudes and Plesm ana
are threatening Kourduzi, the capture of
which wiU cut off Grevena from Kasani
and Elassoni and put tbem on the flank
and well in tha ronr ot Edhem Pasha's
army at the latter place.
At the same time the raiders have ob
tained possession of three roads leading
back across the frontier 10 Kalabak, either
one shorter than the route by which they
advanced. From Jvrania they can go by
baltino over the frontier to Miritza.
I< Tom Pigadttza or Sitovon the roads lead
by Georgitza to the same place, and from
their farthest advance at Pieiia or even
Kouiduzi they can retreat by way of
Kritudei and Velemisti, almost directly
south, to Kalabak.
The same opportunity for a retrograde
movement is also offered for the advance
of supports when desired, direct from the
terminus of the railroad connecting Kala
bak with Trikkala, Larissa and Volo.
Advancing toward the low country of
the Kara Ses Valley they find less hard
ship and hinderance to quick movements
from the snows and inclemency of the
weather, which block up the road at
Z/go;-, and Mctsovo will prove a serious
obstacle for some time yet to ihe advance
of the Turkish troops at Janina to attack
tbeni in the rear. Meisovo Pass has an
elevation of 5000 feet above the level of
the sea and over 3500 above Lake Jnnina,
and tbe snows often lay many feet deep
until the lalter part of April. A German
traveler who crossed these mountains in
1893 found the snow in the t ass too deep
to allow the passage of uack animals on
the 28th of the month, and he was told
that it often laid many feet deep over the
road until May.
PEARY WILL TRY AGAIN.
The Explorer's Transfer to Mire Island
I* Canceled and He Will Once More
Seek the North Pole.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 17.âDeTel
opments of the last few days make it
certain that Civil Engineer R. Â£. jfeary
will within a few weeks start on the pre
liminary journey of his attempt to reach
the north polft. Peary's plan compre
hends a srstematic effort, which snail be
extended if necessary over a period of ten
year*; but it is just possible that the most
ambitious aims of his expedition will be
accomplished by tha early fall of 1899.
li s plan lay in abeyance at tirsl because
ol a lack of f unuÂ», and than, last as the
requisite sum of $150,000 was in sight, an
unexpected obstacle was put in his way
by an order transferring him to Mare Isl
and. The time was all but up for him to
leave for the coast when Charles Moore of
Brooklyn, an oM friend of Secretary Long,
persuaded the Secretary to rescind his or
der.
Of this revocation Peary has received
notice, and although no arrangements have
yet been made for the necessary leave of
absence for the carrying out of his plans,
measures for their accomplishment will
soon be taken.
The glory of the American flag, whose
prestige in the far north has been sur
passed by the Norwegian flag after an
ascendency of a dozen years, was a factor
in Secretary Long's decision. Peary
should get started for the north on his
preliminary journey before tne end of
June. He will, however, be unable to say
on what date he can start until the de
sired leave of absence is granted. Ac
cording to Peary's plan the preliminary
trip will be made solely for the purpose of
arranging to colonize ths Esquimaux of
Whale Sound to meet him at a fixed
point ir the summer of 1898 with supplies.
In that summer the expedition will itself
start out.
OWNEY SHOT BY A POLICEMAN.
Death of the Celebrated Tramp Dog Which
Had for Years Traveled in the

CLEVELAND, Ohio. April 17.â Owney,
the celebrated tramp which lor ton
years had been constantly traveling over
the country under tbe protection of rail
way mail clerks, was shot last night by a
policeman whom he tried to bite. Ke
cently the mail superintendent at Chicago
issued orders forbiddine clerks to carry
tbe dog any more on their cars. Owney
toad traveled over almost every railway in
the country.
BANK WRECKER SPALDING.
Infatuated With a Young Lad/ to Whom
He Made Princely Gifts From
Depositor's Funds.
CHICAGO, 111., April 17.â George N.
Morgan of the Chicago Club of the State
University filed a complaint in the Circuit
Court to-day, on the strength of which
Judge Tnlley issued a warrant for the ar
rest of C. W. Spalding, the University's
ex-treasurer, charging him with embezzle
ment. Bail was tiled at $25,000.
Spalding has not been seen. Trustee
Armstrong admits that he was warned in
December that the Globe Bank was on
the verge of bankruptcy and other mem
bers of the board appear to have been
equally careless in falling to take steps
to secure the university's bonds alter the
warning. It is known that Miss Louise
Erwin, Spalding's protege, had vast sums
of money and jewels, gifts of the in
fatuated banker. One present was a dia
mond hrooch, valued at $12,000; another
wms a costly team and victoria, none of
which can be found.
Bank Vfflcintm in Trouble.
ST. PAUL, Minn., April 19â Warrants
were issued to-day for the arrest of Wil
liam Dawson, president, and Robert L.
Miller, assistant castiier of the Bank of
Minnesota â Dawson on a charge of em
bezzlement and Miller on a charge of
grand larceny. This action was taken at
the request of s committee of depositors.
The charee against Dawson is that oii
JuJv 1, 1896, he drew out of the bank
$97,000 in casb, leaving unsecured notes
for the amount. The charee against
Miller is that on December 12 he accepted
a deposit of $1000, knowing the bank to be
inaolvant.

REPORTED HOURLY.
Many Negroes Have Been Drowned.

NEW ORLEANS, La.. April 17â This
afternoon the crevasse in the Biggs levee
was 1200 feet wide, and pouring hourly
300,000.000 cubic feet of water ovr the
lands along the Tensas' banks. The Bil'rs
levee is 8000 feet long, and most of it is so
weak that the break is exDected soon to
measure a mile in width, causing a great
loss to property.
In Madison and other parishes of North
Louisiana the amount of damage done to
big cotton plantations in Tensas and Oon
cordia is yet problematical. If the break
increases it will flood those parishes, be
sides inflicting a severe loss in the low
lands of Catahoula and Franklin.
The crevasse caused a fall in the river at
Vicksburg and all neighboring points,
and will check the rise below for a few
flays, but will only do harm by keeping
t c flood up much longer than was ex
l>ecied.
All the water going through the B'rss
crevasse will find its way into the Red
River through the Ouachita, and most of
it will return ultimately to the Missis
sippi in the next few weeks, causing a
prolonged strain to the levee.-? south of the
Red River. A portion of the levee will ue

endangering all the sugar country near

The town of Delta Is almost entirely
under water. It will be completely so by

levees mieht be saved.
Lieutenant-Governor Snyder says the
Biggs crevasse will overflow most of the
Tensas district. As the flooÂ«l will con
tinue very late th.s year, far beyond the
planting season, it means tt at no crop
will be made in Tensas this year.
At New Orleans in some places the
water is nearly to the top of the levee.
VICKSBURG, Mips, April 7.â At 6

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 18, 1897.
ARMY OFFICERS
ON THE QUI VIVE
Leading Appointments
in the Hands of the
President.
Who Will Bo the Next Major-
General and Brigadier-
General?
Colonel Shatter's Nomination Is
Awaiting- Its Turn for Con
firmation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 17.-The
Call correspondent was told to-day that
there was no sipniticance in the delay of
the Senate in confirming the nomination
of Colonel Shatter an brigadier-general.
There are a number of nominations that
have not been acted upon yet by the Mili
tary Affairs Committee of the Senate.
Who will bÂ« the next major-general and
brigadier-general in the army?
This question is being discussed with
much interest in military circles. The
height of an army officer's ambition is to
attain the rank of a general officer.
Colonels aspire to be brigadier-generals,
and brigadier-generals look hopefully
forward toadvancement to the grade
of major-general.
Only a few days ago President McKinley
made bis first appointment as major-gen
eral and brigadier-general. For the for
mer grade ha nominated Brigadier-Gen*
| eral Frank Wheaton ana for tue latter
grade Colonel William R. Shafter.
General Wheaton retires the Btb of next
month. His leaving the active list will
make a vacancy in the grade of major
general, to which some brigadier-general
will be appointed. The advancement of
an officer of the latter rank will create a
vacancy in that grade. The probabilities
seem to be that Brigadier-General John
11. Brooke, over whose head General
Wheaton was advanced, will be named by
the President as the next major-general.
General Brooke has an excellent record
and is a thoroughly efficient and deserv
inc officer.
in nominating Colonel Shatter as briga
dier-general, President McKinley estab
lished the precedent of promoting colonels
in the order of seniority.
Colonel Shatter was the senior colonel
at the time of his selection. Army offi
cers, therefore, reason that the President
will follow tho same rule in naming the
next brigadier-general. If this is the case
Colonel Henry C. Merriam ol the Seventh
Infantry would be the next colonel who
would have the good lortune of getting s.
star. A friend of Colonel Merriam is
authority lor the statement that that offi
cer feels confident of being nominated. It
is nevertheless a fact that a number of
other colonels of the line are hopeful of
being appointed.
Speculation in military circles is to the
effect that it is probable that the Presi
dent wtll especially consider the records
and fitness of three colonels â Merriam,
Anderson and Wade â who stand respec
tively one, two, three in the order of sen
iority among the colonels of the line.
An officer of the army, speaking of the
probabilities yesterday, pointed out the
fact ihut if the President does not adhere
to the rule of seniority it would be possi
ble for him to have at hit disposal the ap
pointment of no less than eight brigadier
generals in the course of his term. The
officer said that there were a number of
colonels of the line who were deserving of
promotion and who would retire on ac
count of age in the course of the next four
years. The officer had no knowledge of
the President's intentions.
The consensus of opinion among array
officers is that the President will appoint
General Brooke a major-general when
General Wheaton retires, and that the se
lection of a briaadier-general will be con
fined to Colonels Merriam, Anderson and
Wade.
By direction of the President the follow
ing transfer is made: Post Quartermaster-
Sergeant Horace E. Myrick, now at San
Carlos, Ariz., to the Presidio of San Fran
cisco. Cal., to relieve Post Quartermaster-
Sergeant Homer W. Newman. The leave
of absence cranted First Lieutenant F.
Davis, First Cavalry, Department of Cali
fornia, is extended two months by the
Secretary of War.
SUITS AT bAU&AJLITO ROBBED.
r.ay Pirate* l.ont Britlith Teasels in
lUchardion* Bay.
SAUBALITO, Cal., April 17.â Five Eng
lish ships lying at anchor in Richardsons
Bay, off Sausalito, were robbed last night
by bay pirates, who took anything they
could lay their hands on. The ships were
the Kensington, Snaigow, Moreton, Pe
gasus and Fairport. Their captains came
into town to-day and reported that during
the night the vessels had been looted of
much movable material. They sought the
services of the Constable and Town Mar
shal, who set out to discover the culprits.
Although a diligent search has been
made no clew has been obtained. It is
believed that ihe pirates came from San
Francisco in small boat?. They ob:ained
many valuables in the officers' qum-ters on
the vessels, especially on the Moreton,
wnere they got some of the captain's curi
osities. After they overhauled the vessels
they made off under cover of darkness
and left no traces behind by which they
might be located.
SAN DIEGO'S NEW BREWERY.
Formal Opening of tha Largest Manufac
turing Plant in Southern
California.
B^N DIEGO, Cau, Aoril 17.â 1n the
presence of an audience of 3030 native
San Diegans and visitors to the cuy from
Loa Angeles and elsewhere, tha San Diego
Brewery, which enjoys the distinction of
being the largest manufacturing estab
lishment on the Pacific Coast south of
San Francisco, was this afternoon formal
ly opened for business.
The brewery, which is the finest plant
of its kind in the southwest, was projected
in this city about eieliteen months a^o by
John G. Hinkei, John C. "Wunder aud
other capitalists of Minneapolis and Chi
cago.
Since that time Judge Schaeffer of Los
Angeles, John D. Spreckels and a number
of others have become largely interested
until now the plant, including land,
buildings, machinery and stock, is valued
at a cool $200,000. Its product, as sampled
by 2000 people to-day, is equal to any pro
duced in ihe United States.
The brewery site cons sts of twenty
acres of ground lying on the bay front,
with fine wharfage facilities, and traversed
by the Southern California Railroad and
plenty of switches to facilitate exporta
tion of stock. The buildings are eight in
number and include tne brewnouse, malt
house, bottling-house, wash house, office,
ice factory and stables nnd the cottage of
the superintendent. The eeneral ma
terial used in its construction was San
Dieeo granite, red brick, iron and steel,
while ihe floors are of cement.
From forty to sixty men will be em
ployed from the start, and Manager Wun
der expects to increase the number to 100
belore tne year is out. Agencies have
been opened throughout Southern Cali
fornia, Arizona and Lower California.
The present capacity o 1 the brewery is 125
barrels a day, or 40,000 barrels a year.
This can be increased without additional
expense for machinery to 120,000 barrels a
year.
Big orders for beer have been received
from the surrounding territory, and the
institution starts with every promise of a
successful future. The brewery people
came to San Diego practically without
sol citation, and no subsidy has been paid
them for the locating of the plant here.

IN THE DRAGNET
OF A GRAND JURY
Dr. Hunter and Other
Kentucky Statesmen
Indicted.
Charged With Attempting to
Bribe Three Members of
the Legislature.
Said to Be a Conspiracy to Defeat
the Republican in the Sena
torial Race.
FRANKFORT, Ky., April 17. -The
dragnet of the Grand Jury caught not
only Dr. Godfrey Hunter, Senatorial can
didate, but ex-Congressman John H. Wil
son, E. T. Franks, Captain Noel Games
and Thomas R. Tanner. The charge is
conspiracy to bribf. Warrants were at
once issued, the men arrested and put un
der bonds of $25U each. Judge Cantriil
said he would grant an immediate trial if
desired, otherwise ho would assign the
cases for the September term. No deci
sion has vst been reached by the defend
ants.
The indictment charges all the men
with conspiracy to bribe three members
of the Legislature with $5000 each to in
duce them to vote for Hunter. Hunter
said: "The whole thing is a conspiracy.
1 will continue to be a candidate."
The joint session of the Legislature to
ballot for United States Senator was a
very brief one. Rollcall was dispensed
with. One vote was cast for each of the
candidates as a matter of form, and the
session then adjourned.
The indictment resulted from charges
made oy Captain Noel G.iines and his
brother-in-law. Captain Thomas Tanner.
Hunter, the Republican candidate for
United States Senatoi, needed three votes
to secure his election. Many ballots had
been taken, but still the three needed
votes could not be obtained. Games
stated that about this time a proposition
was made to him to secure the three votes
and he was offered $5000 for each vote.
This statement by Games was corrob
orated by Tanner, who said that he had
been summoned to the room of ex-Con
gressman John H. Wilson, who was act
ing as Hunter' i manaser, and shown $20, -
000, which, he was tolJ, would be paid for
four votes. H â¢ swore that there had been
a number of conferences of a similar char
acter on the subject.
On the other side, the men accused of
offering the bribe emphatically denied
that any such offer had bean made. Wil*
son made a statement assertine that he
had been notified by Hon. E. T. Franks
that Games wished to see him, and that
Games had said that he could get three
members of the Legislature to vote for
Hunter for $5000 apiece. According to
Wilson's story Franks suspected that it
was a political trick intended to place
Hunter in some kind of compromising
position, and it was decided advisable that
be (Wilton) should-go to meet Games.
He did to, and Games told him that he
could <ieliver three votes for $15,000, but
wanted $1000 for himself. Wilson refused
to have anything to do with it, and then
Guines threatened that he would get them
all in trouble unless naid the $1000.
This story told by Wilson was corrob
orated by both Hunter, who denied all
knowledge of Games and Tanner, and by
Franks.
The charges caused intense excitement
and were generally regarded as an
attempt to defeat Ranter. The charges
so far have had little effect, as he has re
tained all his strength. Whether his sup
porters will continue faithful to him afUr
he has been indicted remains to be seen.

[Copyrighted 1897, by the New York Bub.]
LONDON, Eno., April 17.â Popular dis
gust in London over the sordid specula
tion into wmch the Queen's jubilee cele
bration has degenerated is now well nigh
universal. The matter has become a
scandal which is nothing less than a na
tional shame and disgrace. Labouchere
makes a comparison of his own country
men with the people of Paris on a some
what similar occasion which ought to
bring Londoners to their senses. Ha
says!
"Some months ago the Emperor visited
Paris. For several weeks before he came
Parisians worked nmhtand day to deco
rate the streets through which he was to
pass and to prepare a magnificent recep
tion for the tuest whom they wished to
honor. Ingenious minds devised decora
tions and men of taste combined to se
cure artistic effect and unity of desien.
The result of these labors was eminently
successful. Two months from now we are
to celebrate in London a remarkable event
in the history of Britain, an event which
will be memorable so long as the history
of our race is told, and the whole ener
gies and whole ingenuities of Londoners
are directed to selling seats."
This in literally true and the rebuke
might justly be made more emphatic
Nothing is now heard in connection with
the coming jubilee except schemes of one
sort or other for making money. Every
body except the speculators themselves
fervently hopes there will be a big col
lapÂ«e in the jubilee before "the ereat day"
arrives and that the greedy plungers will
be badly bitten.
There is every indication that Salisbury,
Cnamberlain ana the Government will
persist in the mad policy of fomenting
trouble with the Transvaal Republic The
most significant point in the situation is
in the fact mat the rate of Lloyd for in
surance against war between Britain and
the Transvaal the next six months has
risen to 15 per cent, and many consider
the managers foolhardy to accept risks on
these terms. Sir Alfred Miiner hastened
his departure to the Cape a fortnight, sail
ing to-day, to take over the governorship
of South Africa to enforce Lord Rosse
mead's departure. Tha only really hope
ful sign in the situation is the fact that
Sir Alfred will soon be in command at
Cape Town. He is a cenuinely strong,
honest man and above suspicion, not
being in any way identified with the con
**>irÂ«cf agAioat the Boers or any other dis
repu'aole scheme lor the extension of the
British Empire.
After nearly twelve months of denials,
equivocations, admissions and repudia
tions between diplomats in London
and Paris, whereof only the faintest
reports reached the outside world,
it is now placed beyond doubt that there
is a French expedition snugly estab
lished in the Upper Nile and tacitly chal
lenging Egypt's right to the territory
which Egypt's virtual suzerain, England,
had in set terms declared indisputably
Egyptian. Nine or ten months ago an ac
count was cabled the San of the mysterious
movements of this expedition and the
suspicion that its real meaning was to
induce the British Government to under
take operations against the Dervishes. It
was too early to publicly admit an ad
vance to Dongola was actually directed
against French intrigues, and the govern
ment, therefore, had to assign vari
onÂ» reasons, not one of which was logical
or convincing, for the apparently mean
ingless policy exasperated opponents and
puzzled friends. It the forward move
ment in that part of Africa was necessary
10 British interests a year aeo, it is im
perative now that the French Govern
ment has blindly admitted a French force
under Lieutenant Liotard, an officer of the
regular French army, who will certainly oc
cupy a portion of Babrelghazel, if not a
sbore of the Nile itself.
Salisbury'^ policy will compel England
now to go as far as Khartoum, possibly
farther, to the boundary of Uganda, which
latter country the people seem to forget is
now British and which in fullness of time
may play an important part in the Anglo-
French struggle for supremacy of the
Dark Continent. Sir Charles Dilke re
gards the French movements in the Upper
Nile at vast importance. He would like
the situation cleared up and to that end
will queition the Government in the
Commons immediately after the Easter
recess.
The latest phase of this Anelo-French
competition for Africa has developed on
the west coast, where England is showing
a disposition to Interfere with Liberia.
This carious blacK republic, founded by
emancipated slaves from the United States
Republic, is heavily in debt and England
has benevolently undertaken to lend it
money, which the French rightly fear is
a preliminary step to a close alliance or
even suzerainty.
White, Charge d'Affaires, had a long in
terview with Sanderson, Acting Foreign
Secretary, to-day in reference to the pres
enratiou of seals. The report of Professor
Darcy Thompson and associates, who
ntudied the question in behalf of Great
Britain and Canada, will be published in
a few days. .

TARIFF RATES TOO HiGH.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 17.â 1t is
quite probable that the Dingley tariff bill,
now in course of revision by the Finance
Committee, will be reported to the Senate
April 26. The business of the Senate is
now so arranged that the decks can be
clerired for the consideration of the bill
almost immediately after it is reported.
During the past week a determined con
certed effort was made by the friends of
high rates on all important schedules to
force their views upon the committee, but
there is no good reason to suppose they
will succeed. The sub-committee took
hold of the work of revising the bill, with
the result that the rates were found too
high on almost all schedules, and it can
be stated on authority that the bill will
provide for a material reduction in rates
on almost every schedule. Senators of all
parties aeree that the bil will not pass the
Senate much bejore July 1.

IS NOT WEARING
A REED COLLAR
Leader Bailey Replies to
the Malcontents of
His Party.
Denounces Certain Intima
tions as Infamous and
Malicious.
Says He Prefers Republican Pros
perity to Democratic Depres
sion.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 17.â Bland
to-day performed a possibly unintentional
service for the Democratic party in the
House. He wanted to get in a reeolution
of inquiry at to the status of the Pacific
railroads litigation, and the refusal of
Dingley to permit him had the effect of
bringing the Democrats solidly together
upon the question of a three-day adjourn
ment for the first time; but although the
Populists lent their aid the Democrats
were unable to affect the result of the vote
and the House adjourned till Wednesday.
The proceedings partook largely of the
character of a Democratic caucus â so
niucn so that Grosvenor facetiously made
the point of order that they should not be
permitted to occupy the time of the ses
sion.
W. A. Stone was inc'ined to permit
their continuance, saying that never be
fore had he attended a Democratic caucus,
and he wanted to see it through. But
later he evinced weariness and tried to
btop the talk.
Bailey and De Armond addressed the
House, setting forth reasons which they
believed should actuate the minority.
They each bpoke to questions of personal
privilege. Bailey based his remarks upon
a publication in the Washington Times,
denouncine him and those who stood with
him as wearing "Reed collars," in the
hope that it would benefit them in com
mittee assignments.
"This," said Bailey, speaking with great
deliberation, "is an infamous and ma
licious lie, and whoever aided in giving it
circulation is an infamous and malicious
liar."
In anticipation of a continuation of the
proceedings of last Saturday, the House
galleries were crowded to suffocation, and
every member in the city was present.
After having disposed of the "Reed col
lar" matter. Bailey said it was due to his
friends to state the attitude of the Demo
cratic party toward the matter in ques
tion. That no useless opposition be made
to the execution of the Republican pro
gramme lor securing tariff legislation was
the attitude, he said, of the leaders of the
Democrats in the Senate and the leading
Democratic papers. If Democrats failed
or relused to join the Republicans in mak
ing a test of whether or not a high tar ff
under a gold standard would briap
prosperity, the country would have the
right to charge that they were not con
sistent.
"I had rather have Republican pros
perity," he said, "than Democratic de
pression [Republican applause and great
silence around him] ; but lam supremely
confident [addressing the Republicans]
that on such a proposition you are going
speedily to your doom."
The difficulties of his position, Bailey
said, were intensified by every lobbyist
and every newspaper whose columns were
oren to purchase, who denounced him for
r.ot fighting.
"I am as ready as any man to fight,"
he asserted, "whenever I can see any ad
vantage to be gained to my country or my
party, but I decline to lead in a blind as
sault wherein blows must fall equally
upon friends and enemies." [Applause.]
While Bailey was talking the chair in
â which sat his late antagonist for selection
as Democratic leader (Mcliillin of Ten
nessee) gave way from under him, dis
tracting the attention of the House. A
new chair was immediately secured and
McMillin promptly reseated.
Dingley was recognized, as against the
claims of Simpson and Bland, to move
that when the House adjourn it be until
Weduesday, explaining that none of the
great appropriation bills in the Benate
would probably reach the House before
then.
Bailey en deavored to secure the consent
of Dingley for Bland to offer a resolution.
Dinsley declined to yield and upon the
putting of the question S mpeon en
deavored ineffectually to enter upon de
bate, makine the point of order that it
vas a debatable motion.
The question recurring on Dingley's
motion De Armond demanded the ayes
and noes. The vote resulted ayes 106,
noes 84, strictly partisan, but one Dem<>
crat and one Populist voting in the nega
tive.
De Armond rose to a question of per
sonal privilege, explaining that he was
moved to speak only from a sense of duty.
Believing that the Republican policy had
been entered upon in order to avoid re
sponsibility for other pressing matters he
opposed it.
Dingley started to moke a speech in
criticism of the Democratic position, but
â¢Was prevented by Allen showing that
there was no question before the House.
The resolution which Bland unsuccess
fully attempted to bring to the attention
of the House was:
Vf herf.ab, There are a number of suits pend
ing in the courts oi the United States to fore-
Close mortgages on the Union Pacific Railroad,
Â»nd that said foreclosures may endanger the
rights of the Government us a second mort
gagor; therefore,
Resolved, That the Attorney-General be and
1b hereby requested to furnish the House as
speedily as practicable information at to the
number of Â»uits brought to forec ose said
mortgages, the amount of the Government's
claim against the railroad, and what, if any,
proceedings have been taken to secure the
Government against any loss In this behalf;
also, whether the Government has been made
a party to these foreclosure proceedings, and
if so by what authority, and state to the House
whether executive officers of the Government
have authority to bring sulta of the Govern
ment so as to bind or preclude it in any
manner affecting the pecuniary Interests of
the Government or to impair the power of the
Government now existing by law to regulate
and control a corporation as to the rate for
freight and passenger traffic, or ai to the
right of the Government to use the railroad an
s military and postal road; also what, If any
legislation Is necessary to protect the Govern
ment in the matters herein set forth.
The resolution also declared it to be the
duty of the Speaker to appoint a commit
tee on this subj ct, to the end thai the
House may speedily enter upon its con
sideration.
After the House adjourned Bland said:
"The law makes it the imperative duty of
the Secretary of the Treasury to pay cer
lain obligations of the Pacific railroad,
but he ennnot, despite the requirements
of the law, unle-s we appropriate money
for him. I don't care a tig whether we
adjourn the House for one day or three,
but Ido care that we should waste time
recklessly when by inattention we may be
making it possible for some syndicate to
get possession >; f the railroad and without
even a vesdge of Government interest in
its title."
Representative Lewis of Washington
introduced a joint resolution to repeal
the law of March 3, authorizing the
United States to appoint a Commissioner
to the international monetary conference.
It was under this law that McKinley
named Wolcott, Paine and Stevenson.
Tlie House received a communication
from Secretary Sherman, advising the
Speaker that it was desirable that com
missioners to the French Exposition be
speedily appointed. Accompanying was
a letter from Minister Patenotre to the
Secretary, saving that the French Gov
ernment was very anxious that the United
States be notably represented at the ex
position and informing him that already
commissioners from various nations of
Europe had arrived at i'aris to make ar
rangements or their exhibits.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 18, 1897.
AIDED BY SECRET
ROYAL INFLUENCE
Peculiar Story Behind
the Favoritism Shown
an Admiral.
Seymour's Daughter Said to
Have Been Married to the
Duke of York.
So It Seems Father and Daughter
Both Profited by an Illegal
Alliance.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 12.â The ap
pointment of Admiral Sir Michael
Culmne-Seymonr to the post of com
mander-in-chief at Portsmouth, which is
regarded as the blue ribbon cf the naval
service of Great Britain, has bad the effect
of one more setting all tongues wagging
as to the reasons for this marked piece of
favor shown by royalty toward Sir Mich
ael, for thecommandersbipat Portsmouth
is invariably conferred by the Queen, and
is an office the appointment to which she
insists upon keeping in her own hands,
writes Marquise de Fontenoy in the
World. Sir Michael has only just com
pleted his term as commander-in-chief of
the British fleet in the Mediterranean, a
most lucrative post, which, on the recom-
menriation of the Queen, bo has been per
mitted to hold beyond tne allotted time
and to which he was appointed altogether
out of ins turn and very unexpectedly,
shortly prior to the marriage of the Duke
of York to Princess Mary of Teck.
It is just this marriage of the Duke
which is popularly reported to constitute
the cause of the good fortune of the gal
lant admiral. The wedding of the Duke
I wa? preceded by so many hitches and de
lays that it was feared at one time that it
would never take place, and it is well
known that the Princess of Wales herself
was most averse to her son marrying
Princess May. It is generally believed
tii at the holding back of the Duke and the
objection of his mother to the match lay
in the fact that he was, if not legally, at
any rate ecclesiastically, bound by matri
monial ties to a daughter of Sir Michael
Seymour, whom he was alleged to have
married secretly at Malta.
If there ever had been any marriage of
this kind between the Duke and Miss
Mary Seymour it was, of course, not valid
in the eyes of the law, sine* the consent
of the sovereign and of Parliament, which
in the case of members of the reigning
family are indispensable to render a legal
bond, had never been either asked or
granted. Still at the same time it is easy
to understand that if any secret ceremony
had taken place at Malta the situation of
the Duke was, to say the least, awkward.
80 persistent were ths reports connect
ing the name of Miss Seymour witn that
of the Duke at the time of the latter's
wedding to Princess May that the English
Government actually considered it neces
sary to issu* an official denial of the ru
mor. This, however, merely bad the ef
fect of still further convincing people that
there was some foundation for the gossip,
inasmuch <is thÂ« last occasion of which
an ollicinl denial of this kind was made
wa? during the reign of King George 111,
when it was held advisable to put a stop
to the story that the Prince Resent (after
ward King George IV) uad contracted a
secret marriage with the beautiful Mrs.
Fitzherbert. Now it has been proved over
and over again, by means of documentary
i evidence and other incontrovertible testi-
I mony, that a marriage did take place be
j tween Mrs. Fitzherbert and the Prince
; Regent, and hence the parallel drawn be
tween the two cases was entirely to the
disadvantage of the Duke of York and
Miss Seymour.
Whatever the case may be it is some
what significant that the very marked
manifestations of royal favors toward
Admiral Seymour date from the time of
the Duke's marriage, and that the knight
hood which was conferred upon the cele
brated London lawyer, Bir George Lewis,
about the same period was asserted to
have been granted to him for the ser
vices wliica he rendered in negotiating
the silence of the Seymour family with
regard to their claims upon the Duke.
Some people even go so far as to say that
Miss Mary Seymour has had a sum of
$300,000 settled upon her by the Queen
in recognition of the deference which she
paid to the wishes of her Majesty and to
the interests of the British dynasty.
CHINESE TO BE EXCLUDED.
Only the Party Bound for the Nashville
Exposition Will Be Admtted by
Secretary Gage.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 17.-Sec
retary Gage decided this afternoon that
he had no authoriiy to keep out the 179 |
Chinese bound for the Nashville Exposi
tion, who have been detained at Portal,
N. Dak. Instructions were telegraphed
the customs officers there to admit them.
This change In the Secretary's inten
tions was bronght about by information
from Director-General Lewin of the exhi
bition company that the whole crowd is
necessary to make the Chinese exhibit a
success.
The language of the joint resolution of
Congress inviting foreign nations to par
ticipate is comprehensive, and makes pos
sible the admission of as many Chinese a*
want to get into the country, provided
there is somebody to say they are needed
at the Nashville exhibition.
It was explained at the treasury this
afternoon that Secretary Gage would deal
with every party cf Chinese bound for
Nashville on the merits of their case.
This indicates that the whole matter is
left in abeyance, and the chances for get
ting into the United States of swarms of
Chinese expected to arrive at Vancouver
and San Francisco with concessions from
the exposiiion company to back them are
entirely hopeless.

thorities regard a soldier married as a
soldier marred, especially if the soldier is
a private, and commnndinE officers have
often gone so far as to refuse permission
to wed to the men under them. Recently
a chaplain out at Fort Assinibuine in
Montana joined in the bonds of matri
mony a private soldier there and a
young; woman who was working as a do
mestic servant for the family of one of the
officers. No permission for the wedding
bad been granted, and none had been
asked. Next day the post commander
reDrirnaiided the chaplain stvpreiy, de
claring that his act was unauthorized and
improper. 1 he chaplain resented this, and
anptaled to the adjutant-general, from
whom the case went to General Miles for
final action. In rendering his decision
General Miles says: "The course of the
chaplain appears to be fully warranted by
law and regulations. Whiie the objection
to soldiers marrying is well recognized, it
is not prohibited by law or regulations,
and the military authorities are not,
therefore, w a run ted in intervening." â

HAD A LIVE SNAKE
IN HIS STOMACH
Peculiar Predicament of
George Averill, a
Farmer.
While Drinking at a Stream,
the Reptile Went Down
With the Water.
Nearly a Year Later the Intruder
Is Expelled During: a Fit of
Coughing.
TOPSFIELD, Mass., April 17.â George
Averill, while at work In his meadow
early last summer, took a good drink of
water from the brook. Lying down on
his stomach beside the stream, he quaffed
deep.
"Gee, guess I swallowed a snake !" was
his exclamation, as he rose hurriedly.
Mr. Averill thought no more of this occur
rence until recently. All winter long he
has been feeling miserable and consulted
a physician for a distressing stomach
trouble.
The medicine prescribed produced an
incessant cough. Imagine his horror and
also his relief when to-day in a violent fit
of coughing he raised and expelled a liv
ing water snake fully twelve inches long.
The squirming reptile had given him no
end of worriment and discomfort. The
snake is beine carefully preserved. It ia
strong, healthy and fat, although its skin
and color have been somewhat affected by
the chemical action of the gastric juices.
Mr. Averill already feels much relieved,

COLONEL FINIGAN
Marin County's Sheriff:
Cited for Contempt
of Court.
Accused of Failure to Keep
His Millionaire Guest In
Confinement.
Sensational Affidavit Filed by ;
Counsel for the Wealthy Pris
oner's Wife.
BAM RAFAEL. Cal., April 17.â A big ;
sensation was sprung in the Finigan j
divorce casa to-day, when Superior Judge â 
F. M- Angellotti made an order citing i
Sheriff Henry Harrison to appear before ',
the court ou Monday to show cause why !
he fchoulJ not be adjudged guilty of con
tempt for failing to comply with Judge
Angallutti's order requiring the Sheriff to
imprison Peter A. Finigan in the County
Jail and to detain him therein until he
complied with tne order requiring him to
pay alimony to hiÂ» wife.
The order citing Sheriff Harrison for
contempt was made upon the affidavit of
T. J. Crowley, one of the attorneys for
Mrs Emily B. Finigan, the plaintiff in the
case.
In the affidavit Attorney Crowley sets
forth the facts of Finigan's imprisonment,
as ordered by Judge Angellotti, then says
"that, notwithstanding the said order, the j
Sheriff of Marin County has failed and re
fused to comply therewith, and has been
and still is disobedient to said order."
The affidavit setsÂ» foith that Colonel
Finigan has not been and is not now con
rined in the County .Jail proper of Marin
County, but is permitted to occupy a
room under the courthouse, wbict) room
is in part furnished by Culont-1 F.mgan,
and to and from wh.ch the coionei has in
gress and egress at all hours oi the uay
and way late into the night.
It i-< further alleged that Finigan is
permitted during the day and nieht to
absent himseli from the courthouse and
go to a hotel across the stieet to partake
of refreshments, and is permitted to sit
upon the lawns of tho courtnouse during
the day and evening and be entertained !
by friend< outside of the counhouse, and
has in effect never been imprisoned in tne
County Jail since the order oi commit
ment was made.
Lawyer Crowley then alleges in his
aflidavit that the fact thai Sheriff Harrison
h** failed to imprison the colonel has be
come a matter of public notoriety and the
subject matter of comment by many per
sons conversant with the facts, and that
in different interviews wiih newspaper
men the milliunaiie Has declared tnat he
was as well circumstanced as if he were at
the Hotel Rafael.
The attorney declares that many per
sons have said that these proceedings
were a travesty upon the law and an ag
gravation of the contempt already com
mitted by the deiendant. He charges
that the Sheriff has greatly assisted Fini
gan in defying the court and refusing to
obey its order.
Upon this showing Superior Judge
Angellotti immediately made the order
citing the Sheriff to appear on Monday to
show cause why he shouJd not be pun- :
ished.
Colonel Finigan was seen this afternoon j
by a representative of The Call. He was j
surprised that the atloruey had gone to
euch extremes.
"So this is like Hotel Rafael," he said,
casting his eyes over the little cell
wherein he is confined. "I think," he con
tinued facetiously, addressing Under
Sheriff Hannon. "that you had better re
move tbow pipes from the walJ, as I may
commit suicide.
"It is true," paid he, more seriously,
"that I have gone across the street to the
hotel, but the Sherill or the Under Sheriff
has always accompanied me. All tlie
prisoners are allowed the fresh air, and I
have been out on the lawn lying down,
where I have read my newspaper, but
thi* freedom is allowed all the prisoners.
Whil>? I was there two other men in the
ja ! were ou' ilso. They were working on
the lawn. Why, even murderers are al
lowed fresh air. Durrant is allowed to be
out some of the time. They don't expect
me to be in here all the time."
The F nigan divorce case has now be
come decidedly interesting. Colonel Fin
igan is said to be worth million.", and
when Superior Juuge Angellotti of Marin
County ordered him to pay $750 alimony
to hs wiie he pleaded that lie was witli

out the means. He was adjudged guilty
of contempt and ordered confined in the
County Jail until the money was forth
ccminsr.
The Sheriff took him in charge, and he
was given a cell in the basement of the
courthouse. He has been in Sheriff Har
rison's custody for twelve days, an 1 the
favors granted him by the Sheriff have
caused the attorneys lor Mrs. Finigan to
remonstrate, jj^eriff Harrison's claim is
that the prisoner has been confined in the
County Jail, and the lact that he has not
escaped is evidence enough that he has
been kept in confinement.
GUNS OP THE PURITANS.
Not the !'â ' uikl >â¢ i l> ii. Usually Repre
sented by ArtUts.
One of the most remarkable facts to the
investigator of our American antiquities
is the almost total ignorance which pre
vails among even those who are otherwise
well informed as to the weapons, more es
cially the firearms, with which our Puri
tan ancestors fought their wan with the
Indians, says the Boston Transcript. One |
of the notions which seem firmly estab
lashed is that the early settlers generally
used the bell-muzzle blunderbuss. Almost
every artist who draws a Thanksgiving or
Christmas picture of a .Puritan going to
meeting gives him a eun with a muzzle
like the end of a trumpet.
Now, the fact is that the bell-mouthed
firearm was never a military arm among
English-speaking people at all, nor was
such a weapon ever common either In this
country or in Englanrt until about the
middle of the las: century, when it came
into use for the defense of huuÂ«es against
burglars, for stagecoach guards and sim
ilar purposes. Tilts blunderbusses which
are common enough in the curiosity
shops are almost without exception Inter |
than 1750, and many of them date from
ear.y in ilie century.
A large bell-mouthed gun was in use
somewhat earlier on board naval and
other armed *hips, but this was a heavy
piece, on a swivel, and used very much as
the howitzer was later.
Then as to the locks. Even some of our
most distinguished writers seem to be
completely at sea on this point. One I
New England writer whom 1 will not |
name, lorf-arof seeming disrespectful to
a man deserving of honor, wrote some
time ago in a magazine article that some
soldier in Kins Phillip's War might have
invented the flintlock by rinding that an
Indian flint arrow-bead would maKe fire
if inserted into the cock of the match- j
lock. Now, the soldier of 1075 was given
a matchlock, not because the military
authorities were ignorant of guns which j
would make their own tire (wheellocks |
and ?napuaunces were in common use),
but because the matchlock was consid
ered better for ordinary use.- More than
this, if he had thought of it he would
have known that his matchlock would not
make fire wiih flint. The flintlock with
which our War of Independence was I
fought requires a powerful blow to make !
the Hint strike tire from the steel. This j
the matchlock did not have nor did the
pan-cover open in such a way as to make
this possible.
At the time of King Philip's War and for
a long time afterward the ordinary fire- j
arm for infantry was the matchlock j
musket. These are plenty in European ,
collections but very rare in America. I
have never seen one in any collection in
this country. At the same time the snap- I
haunce, a primitive form of the flintlock, j
was quite extensively used by hunters,
and probably by the Indians, who would
naturally object to the match, which, if
Kept lighted, would betray their presence,
especially at night. Wheellocks were
probably used to some extent by the earli- i
est settlers, but it was always an excep- i
tional arm and too costl y to be generally
used. By the time of King Philip's War
it was rather olu-fashioned and not likely
to have figured much.

The Hygienic Value of Soup*.
"In a family where soup begins the din
ner, and the dishes following are of a con
centrated nature, the soup should be lignt,
clear and warm, not necessarily nutri
tious," writes Mrs. S. T. Rorer in the La
dies' Home Journal, telling how to make
various kinds of soup?. "But where soup
is to lorm tiie entire dinner it must be of
a nourishing character. As water cannot
dissolve the fibre ot beef, and the fiber of
beef holds the larger part of the nourish
ment, a beef soup, clear and beautiful
though it may be, is not nutritious. The
albumen is solub.e in water, of course, but
as clear soup is boiled, this coagulates the
albumen and >poilÂ» the brilliancy; so we
clarify and strain this out, thus robbing
the liquid of every grain of nutriment.
From a hygienic standpoint, then, this is
necessarily served at the beginning of the
meal, the onject being to invite into the
stomach tha gastric secretions before the
entrance of the solM food. While the
fashion of v dinner soup is almost en
iire!y. in thi? country, confined to the
'few,' the masses, if they would only stop
to consider the hygiene of the fashion,
would follow quickly."

TIMID DEPOSITORS
CAUSE A FAILURE
The Randall Company's
Bank at Eureka
Suspends.
Collapse Hastened by Recent
Large Withdrawals of
Funds.
Other Financial Institutions In the
Northern Town Not
Affected.
EUREKA, Cal., April 17.â The Randall
Banking Company closed tiie doors of its
bank here at 11 o'clock this morning. It
had been rumored in financial circles for
several days past that the institution was
in a bad condition financially. The recent
departure of Cashier J. S. Murray and the
election of his successor tended to in
crease the suspicion and in consequence
large depositors had biÂ»en gradually with
drawing funds. The extent of the failure
is not known at present. The bank of
ficials bare posted a notice that depositors
would be paid in full. All sorts of rumors
are going the rounds ana the truth can
not be reached to-day. The Bank Com
missioner will take charge, when a state
ment of the assets and liabilities will be
made public
The bank, the officers' statement an
nounced, holds ample securities, bat it
will take time to realize upon them. The
directors have taken steps to obtain the
necessary funds to meet the liabilities.
The closing was made necessary by reason
of the business depression and the diffi
culty in making collections upon securi
ties ordinarily considered good as cash on
hand. They ask the creditors of the bank
to assist the directors in their efforts to
realize upon the assets as soon as pos
sib c.
Alt the other banks here are on a sol
vent basis. The humboldt County Bank,
the Bank of Eureka and two sa'vincs
banks are perfectly solvent, and the Ran
dall failure will not affect them in the
least.
The directors of the defunct bank are
F. Korbell, J. M. Sass, Stephen Hill, Da
vid Evans, W. H. Johnston, George A.
Kellogg, E. H. Vance, J. S. Murray and
IA. W. Randall. The president is A. W.

The condition of the bank on the 27th of

ERRORS MADE BY HISTORIANS.
Diogenes' Tub a Mythâ The Hannibal
Fableâ Lies About Cleopatra.
The same year that Alexander died at
Babylon Diogenes died at Corinth, .323 B.
C. ; but not, we may be sure, in a tub, be
cause lie never made such a fool of him
self as to live in one. The story that he
did so had no better origin .than a com
ment by his. biographer, Seneca, who was
not born till more than 300 years after the
cynic's death. '"A man so crabbed ought
to have lived in a tub like a dog."
In 216 B. C, Hannibal, with about
50,000 men, nearly annihilated the Roman
army of about 90,000 at Cannae, in Apu
lia, Italy, but it is all a fable to say that
he sent three bushels of gold rings plucked
from the hands of dead Roman knights
back to Carthage as evidence of hi* vic
tory. The messenger who carried the
news back to the Carthaginian Senate,
on concluding his report, "opened his
robe ana threw out a number of gold
rings gathered on the field of battle."
Four years later the Romans, under
Maicellus, attacked and captured Syra
cuse, belonging to Greece, because of its
alliance with Hannibal against Rome.
As the invading ships approached Arch
| imedes is said to have Bet some of them
on fire with immense burning glasses;
however, modern science has so well wa
tered this story that it only remains to
add that even at this day the feat would
be impossible.
In me year 30 B. C. Cleopatra killed her
self to avoid being exhibited at Rome in
the triumph of tavianus, who had made
war upon her and Antony because the lat
ter had divorced hie (Octavianus')sisteron
the Queen's account. But did she die
from m snake's oite? It is better to think
not. "If bar death had been caused by
auy serpent, the .-mall viper would rather
have been chosen than the large asp; but
the story is disproved by her having
decked herself in 'the royal ornaments,'
and being found dead 'without any mark's
of suspicion of poison on her body.' "
Death from a serpent's bite. could not
have been mistaken, and her vanity would
not have ahowed her to cboos i one which
would have disfigured her in so frightful a
manner. - :
Other poisons were well understood and
easy of access, and no boy would have
ventured to carry an asp in a basset of
tigs, some of which he even offered to the
guards as he passed, and even I'lutnrcu
siiows that the story of the a.Â«p was
doubted. Nor ia the statue earned in
Augustus' triumph, which had an asp
upon it, any proof of his belief in it, since
the snake was the emblem of Egyptian
royalty; the statue (or the crown) of Cleo
patra could not havn been without one,
and this was probably the origin of the
whole story.
Here one may naturally ask: Who has
not heard of Cleopatra's wondrous pearls,
one of which, at a banquet eiven in An
tony's honor, she dissolved in vineear.
Either this story also ts fictitious, or vine
gar was evidently different in those days
from the present kind, which will not melt
pearls.
It was nearly 100 years later that the
Emperor Nero also killed himself, 68 A.
D. Stabbing was the choice this time
though, and of this we make no question.
Whai we wish 10 say about him is that be
was not so bad a monster as usually im
agined. Hie mother, Agrippina, was not
put to deatu by his order, nor did be play
upon his harp and sing "The Burning of
Troy" while Home was on lire.
Our knowledge of him is gained mostly
from Tacitus, who hated him, and from
Petronius Arbiter, who was put to death
for conspiracy against him. "Even in
Rome itself the common people strewed
flowers on the grave of Nero.'"
The Gift of Appreciation.
There is, perhaps, no other natural eift
that brings so much genuine pleasure to
its possessor as does the keea sense of ap
preciation. It teaches us, or points out
to our understanaing, the beauties ol na
ture that are about us, gilds t tie common
place and emphasizes the joys of life and
of living. Appealing to us througn all
our senses, the pleasures that it brings are
ceaseless and unfailing. Seen through ap
preciattve eyes the beauties of life over
shadow and eclipse the homely, rough
places. There is an attractive side to
everything, and this the appreciative mind
will see first and lougest remember. â La

"Johnny Smoker"â!:. M., Hollister, San
Benito County, Cal. The turf guides and
records do not show any record of a trotter
named "Johnny Smoker," either in 1870,
1871. 1872 or 1873. The only horse by that
name is the black gelding foaled in 1882 by
Totaway. Paced to a record of 2:16}4 at St.

Coort Commissioners âH. H. The Court
Commissioners of the Superior Court of San
Francisco are: John J. Mohn, J. F. Pinkharn.
Eugene Levy, Henry Cook, J. F. Tyler and F.
W. Lawler. Whenever the Jud?o of one of the
departments desires to call in a Commissioner
he selects any one of those named. The Com
missioner reports the testimony, say in a
divorcÂ« case, and the Judge renders a decision
on that testimony. In a divorce case the court
decides how the community property shall be
divided, if the parties cannot agree.
Salariesâ C. E., City. The salaries of the
officers of the United States are fixed by the
law of Congress authorizing such officers, and
the salary is fixed at either so much per year
or so much per diem, but Congress has not
passed any law directing in what proportion
yearly salaries should be paid. That is done
according to a rule of the Comptroller of
the Treasury. In 1872 a rule was put
into force so that tue salaries should
during e*ch quarter equal a lourth of the
yearly amount, and to do this the payments
varied each month, in accordance with the
number of days in the month. That is the
rule now, except in the case of the army and
the navy, a recent rule making the monthly
payments a twelfth of the yearly salary.
That High Fenceâ P. C, Oakland, Cal. The
high fence that marks the line of a lot front
ing on Sacramento street, between Jones and
Taylor, was erected there by the late Charles
Crocket's order. Mr. Crocker secured the block
of land bounded by California, Jones, Sacra
mento and Taylor streets, excepting the piece
inclosed by the fence. That was owned by N.
Yung, an undertaker, who lived there with* his
family, a"d when an agent of Crocker sought
to purchase it he demanded a price that was
considered exorbitant and refused to accept
what was considered a reasonable offer. Ail
attempts at a negotiation fell through. When
the Crocker mansion was built the residence
of Mr. Yung was surrounded by the fence,
which stands to this day. After the death oi
Mr. Yung, some years ago, the house that stood
on the lot was removed and the property has
been vacant since. As it stands now the piece
of property has but little value.
The Mormon Templeâ H. S. and Merced, City.
The Mormons refuse to admit Gentiles into
their temple Dccause of a rule that none but
those of the Mormon faith shall enter it.
The following is a history of the Mormon
temples and the one now on* Temple Block.
The first Mormon temple Â«as built at Klrtland,
Ohio. The cornerstones were laid July 23, 1833,
ami the building dedicated March 27. 183& Tins
temple measured 55x65 feet only sod cos;
$50,000. When the Saint* vacated the State of
Ohio and settled at >auvo<Â» they at once be;nn
thÂ» erect. on of another temple. This was of hewn
stone, J'JBxBB feet, surmounted with a tower.
'i he cornerstones were laid .April 6, 1841, and the
final dedication ceremonies occurred May 3. 1846.
We are told that when President Brlgham Young
and the band of pioneers reached the vu.iey of >alt
Lake, after the exodus from Xauvoo, the building
of a temple was determined on and tin- ground se
lected, lbs was on tbe 28ih or July, 1*47,
four days . after they had reached their
new home in the wilderness But the
work or . providing homes and the laying
oat of farms was a pressing necessity, and it was
not until April, 1851. that the whol- congregaMoa
at a general conference of the church voted that a
temple should be built. Nearly two years elapsed
belore definite ac. ion was taken, and on February
14, 1853, the ground was measured and laid off.
According to the original design Temp c Bloc*
m to contain forty acres, but later on this are i
was reduced to ten acres, Its present size.
On April 6, 1853, tne twenty-third anniversary
of th* church, Â»urÂ« had advanced s fliciently to
allow the laying of the cornerstones, and this cere
mony was performed by he full hierarchy of the
cnurch. Tne foundations weir commenced June
16, 1863. and finish d July 23,1855. the cap
stone or the temple was laid April 6, 1802. with
Impressive services and in the presence of tbe
largest asscmb ace ever gathered together In Utah.
- On April tÂ», 1893. the completed temple was ded
icated witti solemn ceremonies a<;itd gre. t rejoicing
over the conclusion of forty years o: patient work
ing and waiting- The principal dln.enslons or tins

The marble-tiled baptismal-room in the base
ment is grand and Impressive in all Its appoint
ments. The capacious bronze font rests uion the
backs of twelve llfe-tized bronzed oxen, a remind
er of a tike feature in the honse built by Solomon,
which 'stood upon twelve oxen, three looking to
ward the north, and three looking toward the west,
and three looking toward the south, and three
looking toward the east, and the sea was set
above them, anil all their hinder parts were in

of fine white marble. A smaller room on an
upper floor, resplendent In blue and gold,
is paved with au artistically designed native wood
mosaic, the blocks being not more than an
â loch square end highly polished. White and gold
are the prevailing colors throughout, and harmo

this the case in the overhead and side decorations
of a large, high room on the north, which la ex

LAVID GAEEIOK'3 SONG.
The Famous Actor Wits a Poet of No
M ran Ability.
David Garnet was better known as an
actor than as a writer, but he was never
theless a dramatic author of no mean re
pute, having written or adapted not less
nan three dozen pieces, including farces,
dramas and comedies. . In some of these
occur pleasant aongs, which are still sung,
while many of his plays are still per
formed. He was born at, Hereford, Eng
land, at the quaint old Angel lon in that
city, on February 20, 1715. His father was
a captain of the Old Buffs, then recruiting
at Hereford, his mother being the daugh
ter of a clergyman attached to Lichneld
Cathedral.
He became a pupil of Dr. Johnson at
Lichfleld in 1735, and the following year
set out with bis tutor for London, where
he entered as a law student at Lincoln's
Inn. Soon after he went into business as
a wine merchant with an elder brother,
but his predilection for the stage, which
had manifested itself in bis boyhood, be
came too strong to be overcome, and he
resolved to make acting his profession.
In the walk of lite thus deliberately
adopted he rose rapidly , to the foremost
rank until, to us-* the woids of Pope, he
was without an equal, ana would never
have a rival. He married in 1749 an Aus
tralian dancer named , Era Violeite, who
lived to the remarkable age of 98 years,
dying suddenly in her chair in' her no us i
at the Adelohi. London, on October 10,
1822. . Her husband had predeceased her
forty-three years, having died on January
20, 1779, and being buried with ereat pomp
in Westminster Abbey. .
Although his literary reputation is
merged in the splendor, of his histrionic
fame, Garrick's rank as a writer of pro
logues, epilogues and ti.e lighter kinds of
verse was considerable.'. His original
plays evinced the possession of keen wit
and fertile fancy., and his adaptations and
alterations of French plays were highly
successful. The song here given is from
"Cymoo," & three-act dramatic romance,
in which it is sunc by Urganda at the
close of the first scene:
One adieu, before you leave me.
One sigh, although that sign deceive me;
Oh! let me think you true I
Cruel! thus, frsanda flying;
Cruel! this fond heart denyiDg;
One sigh, one last adieu.
Though my ardent vows be slighted,
Thonjfh mv love be unrequited.
Oh ! hide It from ray view;
Let me feel not I'm forsaken,
Rather let me die mistaken
Than bteathe one last adieu.

THE GEEEYMANDER.
Ex-Presiclent Harrison Writes That It
Is s Public Keproach.
"The use of what is called the 'Gerry
mander' in orrler to obtain an undue party
advantage in the election of members of
tne House of Representatives has become
a public reproach," writes ex-President
Harrison, discussing Congress in the La
dies' Home Journal. "It is the making
of unfair Congressional districts, not
having relation primarily to population
and to the geographical relations of the
counties composing them, as they should,
but to parly majorities in the counties,
with tne object of giving to tne party
making the apportionment a fraudulent
advantage. lne districts are made up to
be Republican or Democraiic, as the case
may be, and the voters of the minority
party are cheated out of a fair representa
tion in the Congressional delegation. This
is a prave evil, but it may be doubted
whether it would be cured or even much
ameliorated in the long run if Congress
were to take into its hands the making of
the Congressional districts."
Humors of Public Speaking.
A temperance orator, In the midst of a
moving discourse, deplored tne fact that a
friend resorted to the frequent use oi the
daily glass. The speaker said, "I stand
prostrate with astonishment."
Yet another feelingly told his audience
that it was "not the platform speaker, but
the house-to-house visitation and the
utterance of the silent word by the cailer
which did tlie most good." That was a
flight of fancy when a speafcer asked.
"Suppose if a balloon droi ped upon an
uninhabited island, what would the na
tives bay ?"
An old gentleman, stumbling through
au after-dinner speech, said :
"I â I have no more to say, and so â and
soâ l'il make a few more remarks."
Kind was the announcement tnat "ihere
will be two more opportunities to hear the
lecturer once more." It wai wnen the
meeting ended that the chairman asked
the audience to '"close by singing just one
verse of the doxo"ogy."
Sir John Lubbocic, who has been con
sidering the ant and us ways for many
years, has ascertained that these active
insects may live to the age of 1") years.

MONGOL BROTHERS
COMMIT MURDER
Two Folsom Chinamen
Fatally Wound a
Third.
One Holds Their Foe While
the Other Crushes His
Skull.
Friends of the Victim Leave Him
to Gasp His Life Away In
Solitude.
FOLSOM, f'.a., April 17. âIn a dis
cussion over the ownership of a pile of old
lumber to-day Ah Won and Ah Foo, two
Chinese residents, came 10 blows. A
brother of Ah Foo joined in, and the two
succeeded in yetting Ah Won down.
While Ah Foo held him his brother
pounded his head and body with a cobble
stone until he believed his life was ex
tinct. They took the boiy of Ah Won and
threw it over a rifteen-Joot bank into a de
aerted mining claim and then fl.-d.
There was an onlooker to the fracas,
and he hunted up Constable Michael
Burke and informed him of the supposed
tnurder. The officer hurried down
through Chinatown to where the fight had
taken place and captured the Chinese
brothers and landed them in the lock-up.
Ah Won was found to still have life in j
him. and after his injuries were attended !
to ne revived sufficiently to identify his ;
assailants. He was taken to his cabin, j
whera he was examined by the Chinese j
physicians, and as they pronounced his
case hopeless he was carried down to an j
old deserted cabin on the rivsr bank by !
the members of the company to which he j
belongs. They, after sticking a number j
of burning punks into the earth at his ,
head and feet, deserted him and left him
to ca?p his life away.
As the District Attorney was unable to
come ud and conduct the preliminary ex
amination to-day Constab.e Burke took
bis prisoners to Sacramento and lodged
them in the County Jail. Had they been
left here they would probably have been
killed by the fnenils of Ah Won.

PEST IN FRESNO VINEYARDS.
Vinehoppers Threaten the Destruction of
the Season's Wine and Raisin
Crop.
FRESNO. Cat,., April 17.â The vineyard
ists are alarmed over the ravages of the
thrips, or vir.ehopper, on the growing
vines this season. These little insects
threaten at tne present time to destroy
the coming crop of crapes. Already they
have come forth in such great numbers
that they have in places sapped the grow
ing canes and fruit forms of their vitality.
They do not feed uDon the structure of
the vine, but sap its strength by sucking
the juice of the tender cane and leaf.
The insects seem to be micratory. or
rather the air is full of them from 10 o'clock
in the morning until night, and as a result
the treated vines are immediately re
stocked with the pests.
A telegram was to-day sent to Professor
Hilgard of the Stat* University asking
t;.at eip?rts come immediately to study
the pen and devise means for its destruc
tion. It is expected that they will be on
the ground next week. Special effort will
be made to have Alexander Craw, the
noted specialist, visit Fresno and investi
gate the exis'ing conditions, which
threaten the destruction, of the wine and
raisin ctod.
Reports show the vinehopper is far
fewer in number and the damage least
where vineyards are piowed early and
deep. The depredations extend to rose
bushes, etc., and wh^re they hare done
their deadly wore the leaf lias a pepper
and-salt appearance.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 18, 1897.
M. J. DOLAN, Assistant Engineer of the Fire Department.
ENGINEER DOLAN'S
HEROIC DEED
He Rescued J. H. Rulffs
From Impsnding
Death.
Chief Engineer Sullivan Recog
nizss His Great
Bravery.
He Is Recommended to tbe Commis
sioners lor the Second Scan*
nell Medal.
Assistant Engineer Michael J. Dolan of
the Fire Department, stationed at encinn
bouse Id, on California street, between
Laguna and Buchanan, has so dis
tinguished hiirself as to call for the ap
proval of ttie chief engineer, who recom
mends that he be given a medal of honor.
The heroism by which Engineer Dolan
distinguished himself was at a fire on
Buchaaan street April 2, when a coal oil
lÂ«mp was upset in a little notion-store on
Eddy street, alongside of the wood and
coal yard belonging to John H. Rulffs.
In consequence of the storage of several
cans of oil in the rear of the store the
flames were instantly communicated to
the woodshed and stables. In the stables
were some valuable horses belonging 10
Rulffs. He undertook to save them and
in so doing he collapsed from tbe dense
smoke and noxious fumes. In this condi
tion he fell prostrate and helpless. HiÂ«
moans were heard by Engineer Dolan,
who had entered the stable for the purpose
of freeing the horses.
Â« At the risk of his life be struggled man
fully in dragging ibe helpless form of
Kufffs from the perilous situation. This
was no small task, as the engineer is a
small man, while Rulffs is large and
heavy.
During the struggle Foreman William
J. Keneally of Engine Company 14 saw tbe
exhausted condition of his superior and
assisted in dragging Rulffs into the air.
After the rescue the brave little fireman
turned to aid and instruct his men,
wholly unmindful of tbe smarting burns
about hi- face and hands.
Chief Engineer Sullivan lost no time in
reporting this act of bravery to the Fire
Commissioners, recommending that the
"Dave Stannell medal" be bestowed upon
Dolan. Special mention was also made of
the bravery of Foreman Keneally.
The bestowal of the Bcanneli medal on
the proposed recipient will be the second
presentation since the gift was provided
for by the will of tbe iate Chief. Assist
ant Engineer John Wills was the first to
be thus honored.
FRESNO CITIZENS TRIUMPH.
Evangelist Johnson Causes the Last of
His Suits for Damages to Bo
Dismissed.
LOS ANGELES. Gib, April 17.â The
last of the numerous suits brought in the
Federal courts here against newspapers
and citizens of Fresno by Evangelist I. T.
Johnson was settled this forenoon by
Johnson's attorneys consenting to a judg
ment for the defendant citizens, and a
stipulation that each side pay its own
costs. This makes the third defeat for
Johnson during the past two weeks, and
leaves him without hope of ever recover
ing money for ttil lacerated feelings.
Johnson's last auit was against a nnm
ber of prominent citizens of Fresno who
formed a "committee of safety." which
took every precaution to protect the
preacher against the fury of an enraged
populace after the evangelist had ques
tioned the chastity of Fresno women.
The action grew out of tbe famous "citi
zens' meeting" at tbe Fresno National
Bank, wherein Johnson signed a state
ment expressing regret for his utterance
and his willingness to apologize.
One feature of these trials i-* of impor
tance. It was clearly set forth in the in
structions to the juries by Judge Wclborn
in the canes against the Fresno Republi
can and Expositor that there is a limit to
the aspersion of private character from
tbe pulpit by preachers, which, if disre
garded, renders them open to denuncia
tion by the public press.
PORTLAND WILL CONTEST FAILS.
Uillion-Dollar Vardict in Favor of the
Executors of W. S. Ladd's Last
Testament.
PORTLAND, Ob., April 17.â 1n the
United States District Court Judge Bel
linger to-day dismissed the bill of com
plaint in the suit of D. Albert Hiller and
Sarah F. Hiller of San Francisco vs. Caro
line A. Ladd, William M. Ladd, Charles
Â£. Ladd and John W. Ladd, executors oi
the last will and testament of Wiiliam 8.
Ladd, deceased. The decision, covering
every phase of the contest, is necessarily
lengthy, but is clear-cut, and torÂ»ver clears
the name and memory o" W. S. Ladd from
the aspersion cast upon it for the time be
ing that Ladd bad manipulated his
brother's estate to his own advantage and
the detriment of the widow, Mrs. Sarah
F. Hiller.
| This suit was brought to recover sums
apgrejsatiriK nearly $1,000,000, which Mrs.
Wilier, widow of J. W. Laid, and re
married, claimed were diverted from the
estate of her first husband through tho
fraudulent an<l deceptive handling of the
estate by \V. S. Ladd.
The principal item of the estate to
which fraud was charged was the manipu
lating of a block of 7600 shares oi Oregon
Railway and Navigation stock in the
creat Villard deal, which, with its cpnse
quent boom, brought a spasm of feverish
prosperity to Portland. This stock, Mrs.
Hilier alleged, with the exception of 950
shares, was converted by W. S. Ladd to
his own use and profit.

For the first time in tue history of Stock
ton these two factions united. Probably
there was never in the State so harmo
i nious an arrangement between the old par
ties, lv the Republican ranks there was
some dissension, but the majority of the
I delegates were heartily in favor of fusion,
and the opposition found its efforts futile.
! The Democrats were for fusion to a man,
and when the Republican committee
came into the convention to announce the
candidates it bad named, the old-time
rivals of the Democracy were greeted with
rousing cheers. Tie joint ticket putuDby

SEATTLE, Wash., April 17.â "She is
the smartest boat of her size I ever stepped
aboard of during thirty-three years' serv
ice." Such was tbe comment of Chief
Engineer A. A. Boyle of San Francisco,
machine inspector of all Pacific Coast
Government revenue cutters, to-nigbt,
after the speed trial of the harbor reve
nue cutter Golden Gate. With a new
crew, inexperienced in the use of Roslyn
cnal and unaccustomed to handling the
Ward water-tuba boiier with which the
vessel is supplied, tbe Golden Gate for six
hours, over a course to Port Townsend
and return, averaged 13 13 knots, or 15
miles an hour. The contract specifies that
it shall make only 11 knots an" hour.
Under favorable conditions Chief Boyle
believes the vessel can make 15 knots'an
hour.

A Sunday-school superintendent at the

A tiny boy with a white eager face and

THE ACCIDENT
TO THE OREGON
Not Difficult to Locate
the Blame Where It
Belongs.
The Commander of the Ship
Is Probably Not Respon
sible.
An Incident That Happened Some
Years Ago at the Mare Island
Yard.
VALLEJO, Cal., April 17.â The acci
dent to the Oregon is one for which others
than the captain of the ship would seem
to be responsible, and it should not be at
all difficult to locate the blame where it
properly belongs. The naval station,
Port Orchard, as it is named in earlier re
rorts and is still designated by the chief
of bureau of yards and docks, or Sidney,
as it waa termed in the Navy Register up
to 1597, when it was changed to Bremer
ton, has had a line officer as commandant
since February, 1893, and a civil engineer
since May, 1*:<1, and as the drydock was
completed and tested in April last year it
is natural to infer that the water in front
of the dock was dredged to the requisite
depth to allow ships to enter.
In the report of ihe bureau of yards and
docks of October 1, 1896, the following
statement is mad* under tbe subject of
dredging:
A channel 100 feet wide has been dredged
from the entrance to the dock for a distance
of 30 0 feet, and thence widening at an angle
of 15 degrees on each side oi the axis of the
dock. A depth of thirty-six feet at low water
has been secured.
Now unless the ship got out of its
proper course to a considerable extent the
grounding of the Oregon, which draws
less than 26 feet, can only be accounted
for by assuming that the work of dredg
ing was not thoroughly done and that a
bank of clay and other material from the
cofferdam was not removed. If this is so
it would appear that some one in author
ity is responsible for not having the proper
soundings made.
An accident similar to that to the Ore
gon would undoubtedly have occurred at
Mare Island ten years ago, when tbe dock
there was ready for service. The coffer
dam was removed in April, 1886. and dur
ing the same month a trial oi the pumps
took place. In March, 1837, the civil en
gineer reported to the commandant that
the dock was sufficiently completed to re
ceive ship 9, and the coramanciant ordered
the naval constructor tv render a report
after due inspection of the dock.
The naval constructor luckily did not
conhne himself to an inspection of the
dock and appurtenances, but had sound-
Lniti made over a large area of the water
front where the ships would tie up to the
wharf, nnd also of the entrance to the
dock. By means of a sweep or a small
chain fastened at one end to a pile and
with the bight dragging on the bottom,
three piles were located, the tops of which
were only six to eight feet below high
water, and those piles were in ciose prox
, imity to tht nhtil near the entrance of
Millinery.

the deck where the ships would make fast
after leaving the dock. The bank in front
â some fifty feet out â only gave twenty
feet at high water, and on March 26 the
constructor furnished the commandant
with the above fact 3in writing. Strange
as it may appear t c commandant pro
fessed to be highly indignant, and with
the civil engineer questioned the accuracy
ot the report, asserting that the submerged
piles were a myth. The constructor in
vited the commandant to come down to
the water front and see for himself, but to
this proposal he reiuaed to listen, and
contented himself with saying there were
no submerged piles.
On April 5. however, the civil engineer,
having apparently become convinced that
the piles W6re not a myth, came down be
fore bell ring, and with a luff and tackle
wo:Ked by four yokes of oxen succeeded
in pulling up the sunken piles, one of
which, twenty feet long and fourteen
inches in diameter, stuck sixteen feet in
the mud. Subsequently a dredger came
DP from San Francisco, and with much
difficulty removed the bank of blue clay
and dredged the entrance to a depth of
.8 feet for a width of 100 feet.
But still the troubles were not over.
Near the lower or east side of the dock
was a small wharf lor the landing of
material. The intervening space was too
small for any ship-of-war, hence no atten
tion was paid to it. On October 21 the
scow-schooner Alameda, owned by Com
modore Philip Caduc, loaded with br.ck
tied up to the wharfside nearest the docs.
in woeful ignorance of submerged piles.
During the night the scow became im
paled upon one ol these monsters through
the falling tide and sunk, and it took
several days to relieve the craft of her
predicament, when she was hauled ud on
the ways and repaired at Government ex
pense. Philip Caduc subsequently began
a suit lor damages with unrecorded re
sult.
These incidents coupled with the acci
dent to the Oregon point strongly to
ward neglect of the officers of the station.
In the event of non-removal of the sub
merged piles near the Mare Island dock a
ship of more than eight feet draught of
water would surely have become spitted,
and the captain of the ship could not in
justco be blamed for the gross neglect of
the officials of the navy-yard.
"DRY" SUNDAY FOR T A CO MA.
Chief of Police Hoge Dec/ares That Ha
Will C/cse (he City's Saloons
To-day.
TACOMA, Wash., April 17 A row
which stirs the entire city is on between
the Popo-fusion leaders in the municipal
government. Chairman Teats of the
civil service commission takes the ground
that Tacoma is a wicfced city, and he has
threatened to file charges against Chief of
Police Hoge, who got into office through
the commiision. At 2 o'clock this morn
inn Hoge called in all policemen not on
duty and lea a raid on gambling-houses,
resulting in the arrest of twenty men al
leged to have been gambling in four sa
loons.
More important still, Chief Hoge has
announced his intention of closing every
saloon on Sunday. ThÂ« saloon men de
clare they will ri K ht, and all are Jikaly to
be arrested to-morrow. It will be the first
"dry 1 ' Sunday in Tacoma's history if Hoge
makes good his word.
In the Municipal Court to-dty John
Sullivan, proprietor of the Paragon earn
blinfi-rooms, was fined $20. and the other
cases went over until Tuesday. Sullivan
took an appeal. Two weeks ago the
Ramblers were fined $25 each, sucu fines
being practically regarded as license
money.

Striv to Mak Â«PliCes of Worship
Unusua ly Attractive.
"Christ is Risen." A hundred trained
choirs will this morning carol forth tbe
clad tidings in this city. Their voice- |
will float out upon an atmosphere redolent
with the fragrant breath of spring. From
a thousand conservatories, from countless
flower plots, from the sunny slopes of <
neighboring hills and from the shady re
cesses where grow the delicate ferns and
climbing vines Flora Das been invoked to ,
give of her bounty to the sacrea thanks- !
giving oi Easter-tide. No humble chapel !
is too poor to have Us aitar made beautitu!
with lilies to-day, and, indeed, In the j
plenitude of blossoms which here abound
the more pretentious congregations can
outrival their poorer brethren materially
out in opportunities for display.
In almost every edifice in the City there
were volunteer committees composed
mainly of ladies who were working ener
getically and cheerfully in beautifying
their respective places of worship. The
pulpits, altar? and chance's, being t;p
centers of observation, naturally secured
a monopoly of the decorators' attention,
and a? a result almost t-very minister in â¢
tbe Â« ity will to-day preach from a bower â 
of beauty. The weather forecaster, who 1
seems to have a penchant for saying dis- I
agreeable thinK*, has been unkind enough
to threaten a showery day, btit showers or
no showers within the various churches it
will be spring in all its delicate, witc ing
beauty.
If the beautiful mnsic which accom
plished and earnest singers have been
rehearsing, the subtle argument advanced
by each sweet flower, and the genrral air
of chaste giadiiess which pervades the
hou;<* of worship aid not the preacher in i
his efforts to reach the heart of the hard- |
est sinner who c:.n to-day be . ured to ser- !
vices th^n hearts are mo*t monstrous hard
or the preacher has mistaken bis calling.
In the decoration of the First Unitar an i
Church the ladies, unler the direction of
Miss Curtis', struck hippiiy tho key of the
interior structure's beauty. There inhere
no auemi t at the profusp banking of
myriad flowers which harrtonizes well
with those edifices whose inieriors are Kss
stately.
There is, however, no lack of adorn
ment and the resu.tÃ of the ladies' artistic
efforts were most pleasing. Ex ending
from the choir nailery entirely about Hie
chancel is a row of colla lilies, each show
ing a long stem. The chandeliers and
altar r.osts are encased in Mateiy, delicate
ferns. On ibe stand in front of the lectern
were vases of roses and a jardiniere of tall
St. Joseph lilies. Back of the pulpit
while roses accentuate a lacework ot ereen
vines. Ivy was draied about tue wain
scoting at the sides of the church.
1 Tbe Calvary Presbyterian Church deco
rations are simple in the extreme, but
withal effective. On each side of the pul-
Vit is a great bunch of calla lilies, and n
third rests upon a table imraeiinteiy in
fiontof th- lectern. A great cluster of
the some flowers is attached to the rÂ»d
curtain in the rear of the pulpit.
Tbe beautiful altar of St. Mary's Cathe
dral, witn its rich and costly furniture,
make effective adornment there a matter
of comparative simplicity, yet t!:ere iÂ«
evidence that unusual skill and care have
b en exercised in its decoration for to
day. Tbe tabernacle, always an object of
exquisite beauty, is the culmination o: th
decorators' skill.
Its pure white is relieved by artistically
arranged clusters of ferns and palms, and
imbedded in these are bouquets of calla*
Near t â¢ cbanceJ rail, immediately in
front of the altar, nrÂ« two large silver
vases containing St. Joseph lilies. About
the altar are arranged palms, ferns a:.':
other poited plants. These, with i he
richly ornamented candelabra showing
against the rich green altar carpet form a
mo t impressive and artistic picture.
O .c of tiie brightest and most tastetulh
decorated churches is the First Congrei; i
tional. Here a great white cross, with Â«
background of green showing only at the
has?, is hung high on the organ, which i<
back of the puipit. At the left of the
cross iÂ« a wreath of purple iris and on tee
rig ft t is a wreath of niari -olds. Bfmlfar
wreaths adorn tlie chandeliers on each
side. The baptismal font at the right is
banded with wiiite and purple lilac?.
in front of tbe altar is a table bearing

jardinieres ot St. Joseph lilies and of roses.
The committee which had charge of the
decorations here was composed of:
Miss Annie Childs, Mrs. J. Littlefield,
Mrs. J. T. McDonald, Miss Lonise Hoff
man, Miss Myrtle Simpson, Miss Dessie
Simpson, Miss Susie Skiiliscorn, Miss
Anna Onyon, Louis J. Harrison.
One of the most striking features of the
decorations at the Central Method ist Epis
copal Church was a large cross of caila
lilie?, which occupied a position on the
pulpit. From the intersection at tbe pin
nacle of the pipe-organ of two festoons of
white a dove was suspended. A. b;:nk of
callas extended about the edge of the pul
pit and large clusters of roses were every
where in evidence.
The decoratine committee consisted of
Miss Laura Morconi. Mi-s Francis Joyner,
Miss Lillie Morcom, Miss Florence Porter,
E E Quayie, P. Halls, J. R. Largo, Miss
Su^ie Ariboit, Harry Bibb.
The decorations at the Grace Episcopal
Church are to some extent traditional.
Each year the scheme of beautifying the
church is somewhat ibe same, and only
the details are improved upon. The altar
is made beautiful by memorial crosses.
Oi the-e the most striking is the one
which Mrs. Stanford, following her uni
versal custom, has contributed to the
memory ol tx<T iiusband and son.
It is an elaborate affair composed of
pink begonias, white lilacs and delicate
roses. In tie chancel the lines of perma
nent adornment are followed by c> iumns
of gillyflower , and the an me plan is
partially pursued in the body of the
church. At the rear is a great rustic cross
bearing a wreath of ivy. lilies and roses
abound within the ctiancel.
These are only a few of the many places
of worship which have been m.tde on usu
ally attractive lor to-day's services. For
the sake of dainty headuear, it is to be
hoped the weather prophet in his rain
talk has made a mistake. Such things
have happened, but rain or thine there is
alm^s 1 cf rtain to be a large congregation
in every church to-day, and in pan at least
it will be due to the flowers.

Plans are rapidly maturing for the es
tablishment of two new electric light and
power companies in this Ciiy to compete |
with the recently organized Consolidated
Gas ami E ectric Light Company, which
comprises the EdiSuii L'ght and Power
Cornnany ana the San Francisco Gaslight
Company.
A knowledge of this situation has evi
dently affected the market value of the
shares of tue consolidated company, fnr
its stock has shown a gradual decline for
the past few days.
Onoof the intending comietitors for the
light and power patronage of the com- I
ramiity was incorporated on Wednesday
under the title of the Bay City Electr.c
Lij;ht and Power Company. Its capital
j stock is plnced at $750,000, and the incor
â  porators are Louis de Rome, Henry G.
â¢ Knowles, G. W. West, l*red Mueller and
j William F. Gibson. F. W. Harris, a
wealthy grocer, is credited with be ng be
hind the scheme, and others of means are
also reported to be ready to provide finan
cial backing for it.
John D. Soreckeli is prominently men
tioned in connection with similar corpora
tion. He has been taking great interest
in tbe local light supply, situation, as the
Spreckels properties, including the
Emma Spreckels and Spreckels' Market
buildings are large consumers of elec
tricity, and a otiil larger customer for this
commodity will be the huge edifice, which
is to be the home of The Call, now near
ine completion on the scuihwest corner of
Market and Third streets. Ii is proposed !
to organize a company which will have as !
a promising nuileui for its business the
patronage of tlu-.^e propert es. Sun Fran
cisco mm h;ive started the projÂ°ct. and
there is said to be ample local and Eastern
capital bad: of it.
Another factor that is said to have a
bearing on the decline of the shares of the j
| consolidated company is the operation of
i the Mutual Electric Company, which has !
! been in the field for the past few years,
| and which has been steadily extending its
| busine?-s.

HUMMERS RAID
AN OCEAN STEAMER
Strange Experience of the
Passengers on the
Walla Walla.
The Little Fellows Made Them
selves at Home in the
Ladies' Bonnets.
How Thy Reached a Vessel Eighteen
Miles Off Shore in a Fog
Is a Mystery.
Captain Wallace, the crew and passen
ger? of the steamer Walla Walla had a
strange nperience off the Mendocino
coast last Friday night. The vessel was
from sixteen to eighteen miles off shore, a
mild southwesterly breeze was blowing
and the fog was descending rapidly and
shutting out the shoreline. It was shortly
after 5 P. m., and nearly all the passenger
were on deck, when suddenly there was a
Gutter of win_s ami the ship was invaded
by a swnrm of humming-birds.
One lady was gazing out to sea and at
the same time fondling a bunch of beauti
ful roses that had been given her two days
previously in Victoria, B. C. The little
wanderers swnrmed down on the flowers,
and soon each rose had a couple >>f birds
on it eagerly searching for honey. The
nundrads of little fellows were ravenous
and attacked everything in sight. Every
woman who had flowers in her bonnet
was attacked, and the birds seemed to get
angry when they found they had been
fooled.
Third Officer Thomas Hogan was the
worst sufferer. At one time he had a bird
perched on the lobe of each ear and a
third on his mustache. As they were
poking their long bills into his ears and
up his nostrils he nearly went frantic
wi 1) the pain, and hid bimself in the cap
tain's cabin to escape his tormentors.
\V. S. AlacFarland of O.ikland was an
other vie im. He was promenading the
deck with one of the iady passenpers, and,
hearing a gentle flutter, thought his com
panion had something to say to him. The
next instant the hungry bird :.ad inserted
it* bill into bis ear, ami AlacFarland, after
a few words in Gaelic, made a Decline for
his cabin, not even waiting for a chance
to apolozze to his companion.
"It was the most peculiar experience I
ever had," said Captain Wallace yester
day. "Those litile mites must have been
feeding along the shore, and when the fog
feh they pot lest and tue wind blew them
out to sea. Our binnacle lamp and the
loom of the shin attracted them, and they
swarmed aboard. It seems remarkable,
however, that a humming-bird should be
able to cover eighteen miles without a
rest.
"At one time there were twenty of the
little fellows in my room, and I have four
of them still. If I offered them moist
supar in mv open hand they would not
touch it, but if I put it in my mouth and
held my i.and under my chin they would
perch on it and revel in the sweet stuff.
Every one of the passengers had three or
four of the little fellows and the ship's
Cit secured one, but the sailors quickly
rescued it. When abroast of Point Keyea
I ran the vessH close inshore and all the
lit le beauties ware set at liberty. All ex
cept four ni>de for the shore, and in a few
minutes w> re safe on terra firma. The
four in question came back to my room,
nfter circling around for a while and they
are there now. If they are alive when I
go to the ship to-day i will take them out
to the park and set them at liberty."
The little birds are of a beautiful green
plumage, while on the throat is a small
bunch of feathers that glistens like molten
gold. Their invasion of the Walla Walla
will supply a topic of conversation for tha
passengers for months to come.

Be Ready Next Week.
The certificates of membership in the
Lincoln Monument League will be ready )
early next week. The design is artistic ;
and beautiful. The certificates will be put
up in books of fifty. Persons wishing to
become members of the league may join |
by paying into the hind twenty-five cents j
or upward. In return for this payment
they get one of the above-mentioned cer- i
tificates.
To-morrow W. W. Stone, president of
the league, will commence sending out
the 30,000 circulars. The following circu
lar has been issued for the guidance of

April 15, 1897.
To th' Piinc'pals of the Public Schools of San
Franciscoâ Ladies and Gentlemen: You are
hereby euthonz 'J to receive and distribute i
among your pupils the circulars of the Lin- |
coin Monument League aud to receive con
tributions from lie children for that purpose.
Very truly your.-,
Charles L. Barrington,
President Board of Education.
Among the leading men of the country
to whom \V. \V. Stone appealed for support
in this enterprise was General Chauncey i
F. Black, president of the Association of
Democratic Clubs of the Unitt.d States. j
Herewith is a copy of the letter addressed
to him, and also the response:
San Francisco. March 27, 1897.
Hon. Chaujicty F. Black, President Democratic
Ciubs of the United Stales, Washington. IK C. â
My I'eaii mi:: While having but a slight per-
BonaJ in lance, your known reputation as
an enthusiastic patriot noes away with any
hesitation l may have in this appeal.
Grand Army posts in this City have organ
ized a Lincoln Monument League. We pro
-1 o<e raiding funds by popular subscription for j
a luonuuiet.t to Abraham Lincoln to be erected
in our Golden Gate lark. supplemental to the
ibsk of raising funds for the monument is a I
plan to inaugurate a ''Lincoln day" ia the
(schools of the United Stales.
The time haÂ« come, publicly and officially,
to recognize the fact that the memory of
Abraham Lincoln is the property of the Amer- '
ican people. Ihe pathetic story of his life and
Ceath, his deep Immunity, his broad patriot
ism, his stem determination to preserve the
Union and to defend the flag, are all models
that should be helo. up to the youth of the Na- i
tion lor imitation.
We propose that on the Friday preceding
Memorial day of this year the schools of the '
whole country devote a portion at least of tho !
day to a programme consisting of songs and
recitations appropriate to Lincoln day. Grand
Army posts tnrougbout the country will be
Hsked ; o detail vetcraus to visit schools and
address the cbi.dren on matters connected j
with the struggle for the preservation of the ;
Union.
There is a question as to the most appro
priate time for the future celebration of the !
tsay. There is a desire on iho part of every i
patriot that the day when permanently set
shall be divested of every semblance of parti- ;
Euuship. In order that In result shall be at
tained I have suggested a National advisory (
board, whose duty it shall be to consult on |
above-mentioned "questions, to the end that a. :
true consensus ox public opinion may be ascer
tained.
You, my dear sir, are in a position to
advance this proposition. Your position,
your reputation, your patriotism will I
aid us in our purpose to lift Lincoln Day in
our schools outsiae of the narrow limits of
partisan boundaries, making it a patriotic,
history, object-lesson day in which our youth
may learn the value of strong character and
the important influence it has exercised in
swaying the destiny of the American republic.
Hoping to hear from you at your early con
venisnee, I remain yours sincerely,
W. W. Stone,
President Lincoln Monument League.
New York. Apiil 9, 1897.
W. W. Stone Eso.â My DearSik: I have your
letter of March 27. Mr. Lincoln's fame is the
heritage of ail his countrymen, and every true
American ought to feet an equal interest in it.
No honors too great can be paid to his mem
ory, and if the use of my name as one of the
members of the board mentioned by you will
assist in the erection of an appropriate monu
ment to him at the Golden Gate Park I will be
happy to have you employ it, and proud to be
ever so remotely connected with the enter
prise. 1 remain very truly yours,

Frederick D. Grant, son of the illus
trious U. S. Grant, acknowledged the re
ceipt of the letter sent to him in a com
munication as follows:

ART ON MARKET STREET.
The Native Sons' fountain â in commemoration of the admission of California
into the Union â -will very 90on bs by far the most noticeable and prominently placed
monumental feature of San FrancisCJ. Ground for its foundation will be broken nt
Market ami Mason streets on or about May 1 and the completed creation will be ap
propriately dedicated on Admission day, Sdptember 9.
The fountain will in a direct way be a creation of the genius of Douglas Tilden,
the mute sculptor, and of the financial ability, public spirit and critical taste of
Mayor Phelan, who will pay the many thousands involved. The design was pictured
in a general wav over a year ago when the enterprise became news. The design ap
proved by Mr. Phelan was the fifteenth submitted to him by Mr. Tilden. Since then
the sculptor has been busy with the modeling and has somewhat modified the desien,
especially that of the your.g miner. In the fi-st design the miner br>re tae flag in the
right hand, while his outstretched left flung out bis hat in a triumphant anil spirited
way.
The accompanying picture is from a recent photograph, and shows a portion of the
model as it stood a few days ago in Til ten's studio with tue artist at work. The statue

The miner ;s here pictured as he will appear to the thousands who will daily throng
Market street for generations^
During an interview with' Mr. Tilden yesterday, carried on by means of a pencil
and tablet, the sculptor wrote concerning this change:
"The outstretching of two arms at the same time is not agreeable from a sculp
tor's pointof view. The rule of composition rather demands that if one arm is out
stretched the other should be doubiea up. Of course, that rule is not an ironclad
one."
Anyway, it it settled that the brenze young miner of heroic size shall proclaim
the glory of statehood with hat and pick. The shaft will bear on its top a nautical
creation symbolizing the Genius of Hisiory, and this w.ll be ready for the foundry in
six weeks.
This handsome and impressive monumental fountain will orcupy a space fourteen
feet square at the corner staled, intruding Itself mainly into Market street close to the
*idewalk at the point of the Turk-street gore. It will rise to a height of thirty-five
feet. It will be a worthy jewel for the City to wear, and it will be the only one of the
sort until the inchoate Donahue fountain takes tangible form at Battery and Market
streets.
HOW THE CHINOOK COMES.
Even the Cattle in Montana Recognize
the First Breath of the Wind.
Picture to yourself a wild waste of snow,
wind-beaten and blizzard-furrowed until
lhe vasi expanse represents a billowy
white sea. The fricid air, blowing iiaif a
gale, is filled with needlelike snow anil
ice crystals which sting the flesh iiKe the
bites of poisonous insects, and sift through
the finest crevices. The sun, low down in
the southern horizon, loons like a frozen
globe, with halves, crescents and bright
prismatic bars encircling it.

at will and thrive on the nutritious
grasses indigenous to the northern slope,
wander aimlessly here and there, or more
frequently drift with the wind In the vain
attempts to find fuod and shelter, moan*
ing in distress from cold and hunger,
their noses hung with bloody icicles,
their legs galled and bleeding Iron 1 ,
breaking the hard snow crust as they
tr.ivelâ they appeal to the hurdest heart
tor p ty. It is sure death for human
le;n>js to be caught out in one of these
awlul blizzards, with the temperature
down to tuirty or fifty degrees below zero,
unless rescue' is speedy. Yet such con
ditions frequently exist in this latitude, as
they did Ijt iifieen days in November,
18(*J, when it seemed as if the elements
had conspired to bring about another ice
ace and annihilate every living thing.
Would the "Chinook" never come? The
wind veered and backed, now howling as
if in derision, nnd anon incoming calm as
if in contemplation of the desolation on
the face of nature, while the poor dumb
animals continued their ceaseless tramp,
crying with pain and starvation. At last,
on December 1, at about the hour of sun
set, thers was a change which experienced
plainsmen interpreted as favorable to the
coming of the warm southwest wind. At
sunset the temperature was only 13 deg.,
the air scarcely in motion, but occasionally
seeming to descend from overhead. Over
the mountains in tho southwest a great
bank of black clouds hung, dark and awe
some, whose wide expanse was unbroken
by line or break; only at the upper edge
the curled and >errated cloud, blown into
tatters by wind, was seen to be theal
vanre courier of the long-prayed for "chi
nook." How eagerly we watched its ap
proach 1
How we strained our bearing for the
first welcome sight of the gentle breath 1
Hut it was not until 11:35 p. m. that the
tirst inlluence was felt. First, a puff of
heat, summer-like in comparison with
what had existed for two weeks, and we
ran to our instrument shelter to observe
the temperature. Up goes the mercury,
34 -i' 1 --. in seven minutes. Now the wind
has come with a twenty-rive mile velocity.
Now the cattle slop traveling, and with
muzzles turned toward the wind, low with
satisfaction. Weary with two weeks'
standing on their feetthey lie down in the
snow, ior they know that their salvation
has come; that now their bodies will not
freeze to the ground.
The wind increases in strength and
warmth; it blows now in one steady roar;
the temperature has riren to 38 degrees,
the great expanse of snow, 30 inches deep
on a level, is becoming damp and honey
combed by the hot wind, and we retire
satisfied that the "chinook" is a genuine
and lasting one.
Twelve hours afterward there are bare
brown hills everywhere; the plains are
covered with floods of water. In a few
days the wind will evaporate the moist
ure and the road- will be dry and bard.

A Series of Riids on British Ships in

The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Walla Walla arrived from Puget Sound
ports yesterday. It was a fair-weather
passage all the way, but on occasions the
fo^ was unusually heavy. Wnen sixteen
miles west of Crescent City a small quan
tity of wreckage was run into.
"There were eight or ten boards joined
together," said Captain Wallace yester
day, "and a quantity of mol'lings. They
looked like the remains of a ship's decK
house, and I suppose tnat some coaster
buffered during the recent storms. Both
boards and moldings were painted white."
Shipping men connect the wreckage
with the m'.Bting Samaria, but it is doubt
ful whether the wreckage could be lrom
that vessel, as the Walla Walla was away
out of the coune usually taken by sailing
vessels.
The wreck of the steamer Yaqulna has
been abandoned. Captain C. Miner Good
all is of the opinion that the vessel cannot
be raisod, so he ordered the tug Vigilant
back to San Francisco. The winches and
everything movable will bs removed and
then the wreck will be either blown up or
removed j cieemeal. The engines and j
boilers would cost more than they are
worth to remove, so they will go to pieces
with the hull.

THE BIG TOURNAMENT
Getting the Grounds at the
Presidio Ready for the
Athletic Ev-nts.
A Small Camp on tlie Parade Ground.
Men Who Will Take Part in
the Contests Ont for Practice.
Yesterday was a busy day at the Pre
sid.o. On every side there was evidence
of preparation for the grand military tour
nament that will begin to-morrow and
continue probably for lour days.
On the western ond of the parade ground
there are a number of snow white tents as
quarters for the men from the barracks at
tSan J) ego and Benicia, who have been
selected to take i art in the contests and
the site on which they have been pitched
has thejnppearance of a miniature camp.
The men were forced to pitch tents, as
there was not enough room for them in
Ui>' barracks.
All day yesterday there was a force of
men at work on the grand stand putting
on the finishing touches to have it ready
for the great crowds that will want to ob
tain seats to watch the many events that
are to be presented each day.
In addition to the men iv work on the
grand stand there were squads of men in
butternut suits at work laying out the
grounds on which the events are to take
place, the work beins: directed by Captnin
Alexander Rodgers, 1-ourth Cavalry, di
rector-general of tne games and senior
officer in charee, and his assistants. Sec
ond Lieutenant Thales, L. Ames, Third
Artillery, and Second Lieutenant Dennis
E. Nolan, First Infantry.
Then there were teamsters with wagons
and men following them removing the
earth which bad been removed in the lev
eling of the ground, and these were fol
lowad by teams hauling heavy rollers that
wit- mak :ur the space as flat as a billiard
table, so that there should be no obstruc
tions to the men in the several congests.
On another part of the parade ground
there was much activity, for there were a
number of teams that will enter into the
contests tbat were practicing. There was
fence-scaling by men wearing all their
acouterments, such as they would hare
on the field in an active engagement. A
full belt of cartridges, blanket roll, haver
sack, canteen, cup and rifle, the whole ag
gregating fifty-two pounds' weight, is
what the men carried in performing the
feat of scaling a perpendicular fence at
two heights â twelve and fifteen feet â and
gett'ng ready to shoot at the supposed
enetnv in less than a minute if possible.
Others were practicing mounted tug-ot
war. In this the men were strong and
willing, but the exercise was new to the
horses, and they evidently did not under
stand what was wanted of them, for they
did not seem to mind their riders. During
several trials a number Df the riders who
had a "'lead-pipe cinch" on the rope were
unhorsed because thÂ»y couid not make
their horses mind. Tuen there were oth
ers who took points in the art of tugging
on the cleated boards. A scratch ten on a
side pulled for two minutes, but neither
side pulled the handkerchief over the
center line. These men were not jock
eying, but were pulling for nil they could,
consequently neither sido eaiued an ad
vantage.
In various parts of the field there were
aggregations of hurdles, brush fences,
gates, "obstructions" of different kinds,
and various articles that will be used in
the carrying out of the several events.
The genres will be called a Unit 1 o'clock
in the afternoon, and the fifty-two events
that are slated will be called in the order
the committee has arranged them, until
all have been gone through. To-morrow
it is expected there will be a broadsword
ccntesi, tug-of-war, wall-sc.Uing, mountei
cartridge race, mounted gymnastics,
spare-wheel race, hasty jntrenchment and
other events.
CASTING COPPER PURE.
A Discovery of (ireatrnt Importance in
the Electrical World
The current is-iue of the Electrical Re
view contains the announcement of a dis
covsry in the art of casting copper. Cop
per is ordinarily cast by the use of alloy?.
It is stated that the new metal, which is
known as M. B. copper, is cast pure.
Foundrymen have heretofore considered
this :in impossibility-
It is also stated that the new metal pos
sesses an additional tensile strength of
83% per cent, and that a much higher per
centage of elasticity has been developed,
and that the new metal hnsa conductivity
of 0.5 per cent as compared with the best
rolled copper.
This will cause distinct changes in the
building of dynamos, motors, rmiway and
telegraphic apparatus, because the new
copper is believed to carry the same
amount of current with one-third the
amount of metal. Wire niado of it will
have greater strength and conductivity
than the ordinary copper wire.
Mr. Edison say* he accuunts for the
evident change in the atomic structure of
the metal by the theory that the shape of
the crystals has been altered so that their
| lines are parallel, and that the molecules
are thus brought closer together and into
more intimate contact with each other.
It is understood thai Mr. Edison 13 inter
ested in the development of this metal,
and that it will be manulactured under
his supervision at his Menlo Park works.

Free Electric Suspensory for Men With Each Belt.
THIS IS DR. SANDEN'S LATEST IMPROVEMENT IN HIS WORLD-FAMOUS ELECTRIC BELT. It is as near
perfect as science and money can make it. This is a means of curing disease which' is equaled by no other treatment in the
world. It is the result of thirty years of close application to one hobby â glorious desire to- invent and perfect an appliance
which will, without inconvenience, cure humanity of the serious ills which afflict â and that all this study, this experimenting
and self-sacrifice on the part of Dr. Sanden is repaid can be seen from the thousands of grateful voices which are raised in
thanksgivings to the man who has restored to their owners health and happiness. Nor is this all. Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt
enjoys day the largest sale of all the remedies in the world for the cure of nervous and chronie'diseases. No other remedy
or appliance approaches it in point of numbers in use nor in its curative effects. â  â ', \ '-. : .
It Has Made a Wonderful Record. }
People who are sick and have tried so many different remedies are loth to pick up with anything new. And having so fre-
quently heard of the poor results derived from the use of the cheap class of electric appliances which are peddled on the streets,
they perhaps give no heed to the announcement that Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt will cure. But time and proof will remove these
obstacles, and Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is here to stay. It is bringing about a period of popular evolution in the ways and
means of doctoring one's self. A few years ago Dr. Sanden's Belt was little known in San Francisco, and people who had
tried all the quacks who infest the City without getting relief from their troubles scoffed at this new remedy, but as cure after
cure was reported day after day, as men of prominence gave testimony to their recovery of health, and finally, as the medical
profession, after a fair test, were forced to acknowledge it a wonderful appliance, the popular education came about, and to-day
there are iooo cures of Nervous Complaints, Rheumatism, Kidney, Liver and Stomach Troubles and many forms of weakness,
accomplished within ioo miles of San Francisco during the last six months by Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
You Must Use It.
This is no toy. It is a powerful Electric Belt, giving a continuous stream of electricity into the bodv for hours at a time.

Pric?s Are the Lowss', Quality the
Best.
It pays to be well dresseJ. That isn't
exactly the way Shakespeare put it. but
that is what he meant when he wrote,
"The apparel olt proclaims the man."
Shakespeare had a level head and could
give more good advice thsn any man that
ever lived. When you go to size up a
man you look at his clothes as well as his
physiognomy. And the man who is
try ing to figure out what sort of a
fellow you are dees the same thing with i
you. Good clothes have gained many a
man a good position, and the lack of them
has lost many a man tbe bast chance
he ever had. Other things being equal,
the man who is Dest dressed gets the
best place every time.
Now, in these days it is not enough that
a man's clothes should be of good mate
rial. Tuat may suffice in Europe, but it
won't go here. The man whose coat
hangs on him like a shirt on a bean pole
sooner or later has to drop out of the pro
cession of business competition. The
clothes must tit to make ihe proper iin
rression. There are many people who are
trying to persuade their fellow mortals
that a ready-made suit tits as well as a suit
made to order. But they are finding out,
as Abraham Lincoln said: "You can't fool
ail of the people all of the lime."
They Cost No Store.
No man, unless ho be an idiot, would
choose a ready-made suit in preference to
one made to measure â that is, one made
to fit him â provided he could get it at the
same cost. But be can get it at the same
cost â he can get a suit that will tit him
for no more money tnan he would have
to pay a ready-made clothier for a suit
that doesn't fit him. Charles Lyons is the
man who will make it for him.
How He Dues It.
Naturally, though, if you have been in
the habit of patronizing a so-called "fash
ionable tailor," you must wonder how it
is that Lyons can double discount him In
tbe matter of prices while sacrificing noth
ing in the quality of the materials fur
| nished, the excellence of the worKman-
I sbip and the exactitude of the fit. But a
Jitt'e reflection will convince you that it
is not quite so wonderful as it seems.
Where your fashionable tailor sells one
suit Lyons sells a thousand. And when it
comes" to prices Lyons is away below tho
high-priced tailors, and he also beats tb*
manufacturers, who employ sweaters al!

MB. RUST GETS A LETTER.
It Is Somewhat Delayed Because Ad
dressed Under Hi* Christian Name.
As curious a letter as has been received
in Kansas City for many mon.lis reached
the postollice yesterday morning, and
| after a great display of learning on the
j part of some of the clerks.it was finally
[ delivered to the man for w/iom it was in
tended. The distribution cleric, who first
got hold of the letter, looked at it in de
spair. It was plainly evident that the
writer of the letter had been burning the
midnight oil in an attempt to battle tne
postonice force.
The first line contained the letters "J.
S. FE203." The letters were plain enough,
but what did they mean? The next line
began with a large A, then there was a
carefully executed drawing of what had
the appearanc* of a Barber's comb, then a
small a, and finally a representation of a
} house, drawn by one whose early educa
! tion had been sadly neglected.
What should have been the third line of
the address was in the shape of a more or
I less accurate map of Kansas City, showing
I the junction and the streets in that vi
cinity. The last line was another map,
1 showing the boundaries of the State of
, Missouri.
It was plain enough that the letter was
! for some one who lived in the State of
Missouri and in Kansas City. It did not
take a great stretcn of imagination to dis
cover that the comb and the sketch of a
house had some vague reference to the
i Acoma building. So far it was easy sail
ing. But who was the mysterious "J. S.
FE2O3?"
Alter puzzling his brain for a long time
without any good result, the cierk took
the letter to Nixie Clerk Cantield, who is
1 supposed to be able to guess all sorts of
i conundrums.
"1 can tell you a part of it," said he.
j "I can tell you that 'F&2O3 1 are the chemi
cal symbols for ferric oxide. Now, if you
Can find out who h^ is you are all nirht."
Still the distributing clerk was unable
to solve the question. He went at out
! asking every one what he knew about fer-
I ric oxide. He finally encountered one ruan
who was more of a chemist than the
> others, and he imparted to him the infor
â  mation that ferric oxide in common par
lance is called "rust." :
That is how J. S. Rust received the let

CHEMISTRY VS. BURGLARY
How Sa'e-Crackers May Ec
Foi^d by a Volatile
Fiuii
Test of the Invention Made in the
Presence o\ Bankers and Oteer
Specta'o?.
When tlie enterprising burglar goes
"a-burjrling" lor bank vaults he will find
that chemicals can be employed to d fend
treasure as well a3 to expose It. Yester
' day on Ninth avenue, south of tho park,
i there was an exhibition of a recently
patented invention which may ultimately
prove of great value to bankers and other
custodians of money and securities. The
test was made in a room containing a
cut ic area four times as great as thut of
I any treasure vault in this City. It was
: made in the presence of bankers and lead-
I ing representatives of several of the larg
i est financial institutions of San Francisco
\ and New York.
The merit of the invention is its sim
; plicity. It consists plainly of a gla^s tube
'â¢ liiled with a volatile chemical compound.
: The tube is encased in a perforated metal
! J'ipe which 13 strong enough to resist any
i ordinary use, but when violence is used
i tlie glass tube is at once broken and the
j fluid escapes.
The fluid is so volatile that the fumes
I spread at once, making it impossible for
one to breathe the atmosphere surround
ing the safe or vault. The perforated
I pipes are made to fit in or on the outs de
: of a burglar- proof safe or vault and over
! the lock and bolt work of vault doors.
The experiment yesterday was ma c by
; the managers of the Chemical Safe-pro
; tector Company. At the appointed time
1 the chemiit in charge of tne test struck
j tne tube a sharp blow with the hammer.
j A yellowish vapor issued immediately
from the perforations and floated to the
floor, spreading along the floor in all di
rections. The door of the room was open
to admit fresh air, but within three min
j utes after the tube was broken the fumes
i compelled the managers and spectators to
i retiie.
It was the expressed opinion of the
bankers who witnessed the experiment
yesterday that the invention is practical,
cheap and effective. At the present time
burglais have no neutraliz ng agency 10
resist this invention. Commenting on
the experiment one of the spectators said :
"Of course a burglar with a large family
dependent upon him for support, might
invoke the a a of some chemist of super
ior skill and obtain a neutralizing chem
ical compound to render the fumes endur
able, but time and ingenuity would De
necessary to perfect a counter invention.
Meanwhile the use of the fluid will render
tbe burglar's calling dangerous and un
profitable."
The inventor* are Californians and the
patent has been serured. Safe-owners anl
others before whom tests have been made
highly commend the invention. The
dcv cc is so cheap ana effective that it is
bound to enlist the attention of men and
corporations engaged in the business of
protecting treasure.
In the test yesterday eight ouncesof the
fluid were used and the chemists contend
that the room will not be habitable for
twenty hours after the breaking of the
tube. In future experiments a dog may
be placed in the room to ascertain if l the
fumes are fatal.
Mirer Held to Answer.
George W. Silver, the alleged owner of mines
in the Peruvian Andes, was yesterday hell to

Joacnimsen in $1000 bonds, for passing a tic

worst kind. â 
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SUNDAY, APRIL 18, 1897.
RUINART WINS
ANOTHER STAKE
Beat Buckwa Easily for
thjÃ Palace Hotel
Handicap.
Once More th) Books Laid a
Long Pries Against
Him.
Montalvo Downed for a Stake by
Baby Bill â Rosormonds Cap'urei
the Cand?laria Ha;dicap.
It was a good card the California Jockey
Club offered race-goers yesterday, and ;
Emeryville track contained a Jar te 'c crowd |
by the time the bell called the hors3s to!
the post for the opening event. Not often '
does a racing association in this section of '
the country run off three stake races in
one day, and little is the wonder at the at
tendance.
The Palace Hotel stake, over one mile
and a furlonc, with $1000 to the winner,
took precedence over the other events, and
the winner, Ruinart, demonstrated be
yond question of a doubt that he is the
best horse in training in California and
possibly several other Western States.
He picked up 118 pounds, an increase of
two pounds over liis impost carried in the
Burns handicap, and won :nipressively â
yes, easily. And, for some unknown rea
son, possibly the peculiar manner in
which he was ridden by Marty Bergen,
tne members of the ring were please i to
lay 9 and 10 to 1 against the brown son of
St. Carlo.
Installator and The Roman, both of
which dorses had finished behind him
in the Burns, were made favorites in the
betting, couplied, at odds of 5 to 2.
Buckwa, with his 12"> pounds in the saddle,
opened at 1% to 1, receding to 16 to
5. Wheel of rortune was quietly nibbled
at and Redskin was a quiei tip which
found its wuy to many ready ears.
When the field was dispatched, nicely
aliened, Coady on Buckwa sifted away
in front at a ciip that was bound to cause
distress.. Redskin ran well up in the
bunch for a while and then cried quits.
Installator flattered his supporters, too,
for a way, and then he passnd it up. All
this time Bsrgen an>i Ruinart were
shuffling along In last position. Into the
streic.i o.d Buckwa was still plowing
along at a great rate, but when Coady
took a glance back an anxious look spread
over his features and he urged his mount
a trifle harder.
Presently the cause of his terror was
made apparent. Bergen and Kuinart
were playing checkers; Bergen with iiis
eye on the king row, and there was no
Mopping tfieni. Foot by foot the brown
horse was devouring ground with as much
apparent fondness as an a Mentor would a
snmy fat pickaninny, and persuasive as
Coady's riding was, Buckwa was braten
out half a length in I:s3}^. Once more
liuinart won and his veteran rider came
in for an ovation, and it is safe to predict
tbnt the day of lone prices against iho
i air is now a thing oi the past. Cai.delaria
secured third money.
0/ I lie other events decided, favorites
toot but two. The books all received a
big play, but as neuriy all of the winning
outsiders were backed, tl.e majority of
them quitlo^er on the day.
The capture of the Candelaria handicap j
for two-year-olds at five lurlonjts, by '
Rosornionde, daughter of mighty Or- I
mond'j and Fairy Rose, was r.boiit the j
bigt.'fÂ»t surprise of the day. It wai gen
orallv conceded a "mnrnl" lor the Burns
it Waterhonse pair Recreation and Miss !
Koweni, the pair ruling 7 tn 10 favorites i
in the betting. At the star' Miss Rowena j
was away tancled up, and Hennessv man- 'â¢
iigini: to get cutoff wit.! her stable mate. !
Ciawson on Uosormonde made all the \
rtmninr, and led Recreation out a length
in I :o2>^. The Cheat finished a fair thtrd. i
The Athenian Club hurdle handicap,
two anu a quarter miles, with nine ou
stacle.s to cw-ar, attracted a Held of six j
"leppera" to the post. Montalvo, ridden i

by Gsorge Cocbran and carrying 155
pounds, was the warmest . Kind of a
favorite, tbe books holding the big
jumper at even money throughout nearly
all of the betting. Baby Bill, against
which 9to 1 was laid skipped away in
front, and, although it was freely pre
dicted he would quit, failed to do so, and
in a bard drive downed the favorite a
neck. The well-played JO C was third.
Billy Randall's black Montana horse.
Ostler Joe, had speed to burn, and started
a6 to 5 favorite lor tbe first race over a
mile. Up was away in front, and holding
his field safe, won with comparative ease
in 1:42. In a drive Clawson, on Ber
nardillo, took the place from Grady
through superior riding. Vlnctor ran sec
ond to the stretch, where he grew tired.
The two-mile race was a very pretty con
test, and served to show little Clawson,
Aikin & Lottridge's clever young rider,
to good advantage. The lad had the
mount on Unity, the 2 to 1 favorite, and
rode him with perfect judgment. Wai;
ing back in the bunch with Ezell'a horsÂ«
until reaching the stretch, the final time,
he made his run, and overhauling one
after another of his field, he beat Collins
out a length handily in 3:22. The latter
horse cut out nil the running. Oakland,
very poorly handled by Jones, was third,
lapped on Collins.
w. B. cjink's sprinter, C?e?arian, took
the final five and a half furlong scramble,
starting equal choice in the betting with
California. Zamar II led into the stretch,
where Cfesarian headed him and won
cleverly 0y Â« length. Away from thn poÂ«t
poorly, California finished a close third.

1 Can Yon Tell a Person's Character by !
the Shape of the Lower Jaw?
I have just Dr. Lent's letter on ''Physi
| ognomy" in the Medical Council, and I '
I am prompted to say in reply to nis request I
j for contributions on the "chin": y.
Protruding chins characterize men and '
â¢ women of the get-there type. Succe>sfiil 'â 
I people usually carry their chins thrust
i forward, with compressed lips. This chin, '
I if heavy, with broad rami and swelling !
' masseters, indicates fighting blood.
A retreating chin shows lack of force,
mentally, morally and physically ; usually
of the vie ding soil: soon discouraged;
desires protection ; small executive force. ;
The development of other faculties often i
makes up for tins defect.
A small well-rounded chin, with mobile \
and red cushion of flesh unon. indicates a
pleasure-lovins own- r. If dimiil"d all
1 the more so, for dimpled chins belong to |
, coquette*. People with dimples love 10 be I
i petted and lovÂ«>d; like admiration and
! praise. Generally fickle. Usually ttiis i
chin is healtuy, recuperative and long- ;
', lived. -.;.?"
Broad clii'is signify nobleness and large j
dimity, unless vertically thin, when, if â¢
j with it there be thin lips ot bloodless
kind, you find cruelty.
Square cum* with little flesh denote
j firmness and executive cbllitr. ' Thes? '
! make good haters.
Drunkards usually have a circular line i
' about their chins.
Slovens have wiinkles about their chin*. '
Ling thin chins are poetical, unstable '
and delicate in constitution. Such people
j are subject te bowel derangements. It '
i thin through the angles of the moutn, {
j too, they are prone to tuberculosis. Gen- â¢
erally short-lived.
Medium chins with a suggestive bifurca- :
! tion in the center, with small mounds ot '
, flesh on either side, character z> geiu-r
--i OJity, impulsiveness, cheery natures. ,
; (The same sized chins with a dab of llesn ;
; just under the center of tlio lower ll|.. mi
i dicate meriineii, selfishness, brutality.)
N. B. â No one feature can be taken in j
: judging character. Often development of
! other faculties of mind or feature entirely '
governs. In each case take the "totality :
|of indications" before judging.â St. Louis

Prise Directors Investigate the
Story of the "Dead
March."
Five Convicts Gain Their Liberty en
Paroleâ Testing Coal for the
Ju'.emill.
The State Board of Priion Directors met
at San Quentin yesterday and labored
late into the afternoon to transact the
business of that penal institution. As a
result five convicts were made happy by
being liberated on parole. Others were
made unhappy by having their petitions
tor parole denied or tneir credits taken
from them. A considerable amount of
the business was routine.
Before closing the session the directors
summoned Theodore Durrant, the con
demned murderer of Blanche Lamont, be
fore them to investigate a published report
to the effect that the prison band had ma
liciously played the "Dead March" near
Durrani's cell for the purpose of offending
the condemned. The leader of the band
stated that the band did not discourse the
somLer musical production, but that it
was probably an overture that, was not
recognizud. Durrant was called before
the board. He stated that he loves music
and that be was never offended by any
music played by the convict band. That
settled it.
The Warden informed the directors that
Le is in receipt of scores of applications
for permission to witness the execution of
Durrant. If all should be granted thÂ«
prison buildings would not bold the crowd
that would be present. A limit to the in
vitations to be issued must be made, and
tie wanted the advice of the directors.
The directors were not lon-; In reaching a
decision, and that Whs instructions to the
Warden not to issue any invitations ex
cept to those permitted by law to witness
<he execution. The Warden will beau
vised, later on, by the directors as to who
the favored ones will be.
Wardeu Hale reported that the Tiburon
cross-country road between San Rafael
end Tiburon, being constructed by cor.
victs at the county's expense, is progress
ing fast and favorably, lie said that
President and General Manager Foster of
the Â£farÂ» Francisco and Norto Pacific Rail
load had offered to loan a lot of rails and
ties to be used for the construction of the
county road. By the use of a track tne
road material can be carried from place
to place rapidly, tcus facilitating the con
struction of tne road. Warden Hale

L. W. Wadham,
Expert for the Board.
R. D. Perry, secretary of the India
famine relief committee, appeared before
the board and a<=ked for a lot of jute
bags in whica to put the grain and corn
that is coming from the East in bulk. His
request was indorsed by Mayor Phelaa
and the Chamber of Commerce by letters.
Mr. Perry said that there is a lot of grain
now in the warehouse at Port Costa that
mast be bagged at once.
Chairman Fitzgerald stated that all of
the bags that can be made for this season
hare already been sold to the farmers at
low prices and that the board has no au
thority to dispose of the State's property
lor charity or other purposes. Mr. Fitz
gerald suggested that there are people of
this Nation, particularly in the Mississippi
Valley, who are Badly in need of all the
' assistance that can be afforded.

rior Court of Marin County was convicted
and sentenced to twenty year*' imprison
ment in Folsom. But for this Kelly would
have been out of prison by this time. The
claim was allowed, to be paid out of the
general appropriation, as the State Jaw
provides for the reimbursement of coun
ties for the trial of the State's convicts for
crimes committed within the prisons.
The matter of getting another large sup
ply of coal for the prison mills provoked
considerable discussion. Commissary
Tharp stated that there are several coal
dealers who would like to bid for the next
cont r act. However, the cheapest kinds
are not always the most economical for
steam-making purposes. The board de
cided that all the kinds of fuel offered
should be tested, and all bidders were
given the privilege of placing 100 tons in
ihe mill for a test, stipulating that the
bidders should be paid lor the same at the
price per ton offered by the successful
bidder.
Seven parole petitions were considered
by the board ana the following tive cases
were favorably reported, to be paroled in
July next:
George L. Walton, Tulnre County, robbery,
sentenced to sixteen years; term expires May,
1901.
David Johns, Butte County, frrund larceny,
five years 'erm expires April, 1898.
George Besette, Los Augeles County, rob
bery, ten years; term expires May, 1899.
Matthew Thompson, Butte County, robbery,
five yefirs; term expires Juiy, 1898.
Frank Gibson, Kings County, grand larceny,
ten years; term expires February, 1900.
The petition of Clinton R. H. Lee fora
restoration of his credits was taken under
advisement. In 1884 he was sentenced to
twenty years, from Fresno, for stage rob
bery, and seven years apo hÂ« was mixed
up prominently in an attempt at a fail de
livery. Pbil Betzler, also a stage robber,
sentenced to seven years, stabbed a cell
mate. He was punished by the forfeiture
of his credits, amounting to a year, and
by being sent to FolÂ«om.
The assault by convicts upon Warren E.
Price, the A. P. A. writer and editor of ]
The Steamer Wellington at Folsom Wharf No. 2 and the Dunsmuir
Bunkers. The Forehold Bucket Fell Eack Into the Hold
and Killed P. Ferguson, Besides Injuring Charles Hansen
and Another Stevedore.
the Light, who is serving out his sentence
for sending improper matter through the
United States mails, was investigated.
The account of 'be assault was piven
in 'J ii k Call yesterday and reiterated by
Price, who snia that in consequence of
anicles he had written concerning Cath
olicism and its believers he had exerted
the ill wiil of a large numb.-r of prisoners.
He said :
"They got after me a week ago Thurs
day in one of the snort passageways lead
ing to the jutemill. I was keeping tally
on the convicts as they went to dinner,
and Lambert was calling tbem oft to me.
I was not looking for them to begin the
trouule so Boon, although I bad been
warned that they would <to me up. Sud
denly two or three jumped out of the line
and ir:Â»- Ito get at me. 1 was sitting on a
chair. Lambert held one away, but the
other gave me a blacl: eye. Captains
Ja :iu'-iiii and Sullivan came to my rescue,
and I got off very luckily. Since then the
prison olliciais tiave treated me very nice
ly, and have placed me on the outside,
where there is no fear of my being mo
lested again."
Convict O'Brien was the one who hit
Price in the eye and Convict John Me-
Natty, the murderer, is said to be the per
son who engaged in a struggle with Lam
bert, but to what purpose is not clearly
understood. O'Brien told two stories to
the directors, the unbstance of which was
that he struck Price for having cast
slurring remark* upon the Catholic sis
ters and fathers. Captains Jameson and
Sullivan did not throw much light upon
the case except to tell of the trouble.
The directors punished O'Brien by the
forfeiture of all of his credits, amounting
to a year's time.
PROM GEN. SHERMAN'S LIBRARY.
Some Five Hundred Book* Sold to a
Second-Band Dealer for #:iO.
A collection of books of the lale General
W. T. Sherman was sold in St.
Louis recently for $30. It consisted of
about 500 volumes of army records, regi
mental histories, courts-martial records
and a general assor merit ol war litera
ture. The sale was made by Thomas
Dooley, a carpenter, who did work for
General Sherman while the latter had hit
headquarters in this city as the com
mander of the United States army.
According to Mr. Dooley, General
Sherman gave him the books just be
fore he left St. Louis. The carpenter kept
them until he moved irom 3928 Morgan
street, a short time aeo, whe:i be pneked
the library in four large boxes. He then
sold the outfit to a downtown book dealer
here for $30. Tne dealer was not aware at
the time that he was securing a bonanza,
as when he offered $30 for the outfit he did
it on a venture. On examination he
found a number of valuable pieces of lit
erature and a large proportion of the books
contained the autographs of men of re
nown.
There were testimonials from U S
Grant, Rutherford B. H nyea, Phil Sheri
dan and others, besides any number of
books presented to General Sherman by
the authors. Many books, otherwise
worthless, were made valuable by the
autograph of the general himself. Among
the books were several copies presented by
Mrs. Sherman to her son Tom. He is now
a Jesuit missionary, and the buok-dealer,
who knows him, intends sending him tue
volumes.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 18, 1897.
CRUSHED UNDER
A COAL BUCKET
One Stevedore Killed and
Two Others Seriously
Wounded.
Tragedy on the Wellington
While Hoisting the Fue.
From the Hold.
The Gar Was Out of Order and It
G^vj Way During the Rush
'. of Unloading;.
The Dunsmuirs* coal bunkers at Folsom
No. 2 were the scene of a terrible tragedy
yes erdsy morning. One of the buckets
-lipped when it leached the chute and
tumbled back into the bold. It crushed
the life out of one man who was working
in the hold, dangerously, wounded another
and slightly injured a third.
Poter Ferguson was handling the buck
ets in the forehold and Charles Hansen
was assisting him. The work was being
done at express speed and the Dunsmuirs
thought the men were earning more than
they should. In the old days it usually
took four days to discharge the Welling
ton, but the millionaire mine-owners came
to the conclusion that the work could be
done in half the time and the attempt
was made. The result is that one man is
on a slab in the Morgue crushed out of all
semblance of humanity and anotber had
to be takeu to the Receiving Hospital,
while a third had to quit work for the day
and go home. Hansen heard the rattle
of the broken gear and ran toward the
starboard siile of the ship. He was not
quick enough, however, as the edge of the
descending bucket struck him and broke
his shoulder blade.
The machinery of the bunkers is oper
ated by electricity and is supposed to be
the most perfect of its kind on the coast
By a mechanical contrivance the buckets
that are lifted from the ship to the
bunkers are caught by a hoox on reach
ing the top of tiie derrick and are swung
over into the bunkers. The bucketful of
coal that caused the trouble yesterday was
h> asted to the top of the derrick, but in
stead of b^inij caught by the hook the
chain slipped and the bucket fell back
into i iie hold.
James E. Maridey, the man who was
handling the winches, was arrested on a
charge of mansiaugnter. He was advised
to skip, but he decided to remain and
face the music. An inquiry will be held
to- morrow.
Hansen was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, were it was found that he had sus
tained a fracture of the left shoulder
blade and an abrasion of the left arm.
Dr. Rinne attended to his injuries and he
wns able to go to his home in Boulton
court.
Mr?. Ferguson called at the Receiving
Hospital about 2 o'clock. She had learned
of the accident frcm a friend and hurried
to the hospital, thinking her husband bad
been taken there. The friend had not the
courage to tell her that her husband's
body was in the Morgue.
Sne wns in a hysterical condition, and
Matron Keane, comprehending the situa
tion, got her to remain in her ward till she
communicated with her father, Charles F.
Jacobus, who is employed in the Union
Iron Work--.
Her father called with a hack and took
her home, where the news was gently
broken to her. She was married to Fer
guson seventeen months ago. and is ex
pecting ti.e birth of a child. She told the
matron that her husband had arranged
to take her to the theater last night.
A Good Whaling Story.
"When a whaler is fitted out from home
she lakes her officers, boatswains and a
few foremast hands and steers for the
Western Islands (Azores). Arrived there,
a boat is lowered, and a box of new boots
put in it. The crew pull ashore, into some
convenient little bay surrounded by
woods, and landing they open ; the box of
boots and stand them all 'along in a row.
Then one man begins at one end of the
row and pulls all the boots on and off
again, one alter the other. They then
board their boats and pull off around the
point out of sight, and the natives, who
have been watching them from t:ie woods,
come down and try the boots on. WhÂ«n
the officer in charge of the boat thinks
they have had time enough to be fitted be
comes back, and the poor 'Gees, being un
able to run with the boots on, are easily
captured and carried off whaling.' I know
this to be a fact, for the whalers told me
ot it, themselves."â "On Many Seas."

CHILD PATIENTS
HAVE DIPHTHERIA
The Scourge Is Epidemic
in the Children's
Hospital.
Nine Virulent Cases Authenti
cated and Six More Un
der Suspicion.
Ten Cases Reported From Various
Parts of the City Within
Forty-Eight Hours.
Diphtheria, the dreaded scourge of the
little ones, has inraded the Children's
Hospital, and nine of the inmates are al
ready down with it. Six more children
showed ajgna of the disease yesterday, and
the wildest alarm prevails in the institu
tion.
The first signs of an epidemic in the
hospital made their appearance on Thurs
day, when several children developed
symptoms that led Dr. Lewitt, the physi
cian of the institntion, to believe that
they might be suffering with diphtheria-
He immediately made use of the throat
swabs provided by the Board of Heaith to
detect sued cases, and sent them to Dr.
Spencer, the bacteriologist of the Doard.
On Frfday Dr. gpencer reported that the
children were suffering from diphtheria
of a virulent type, and the hospital was al
once quarantined and orders given that
no more visitors be admitted until the
scourge has been stamped out.
Yesterday six more childron ; bowed
symptoms of the disease, and swaba liiat
had been used on their throats were sent
to the bacteriologist.
Tiie names of those known to have the
disease are: Arthur Hank, Isabel Arm
strong, Charles Harper, Etta Salzman,
Edwin McKnigbt, Hesley 'Williams,
Amelia Mogel, Frank Harper and Frank
Knorr.
How the disease obtained a foothold in
the hospital is a mystery, for, as lar as
known, the sanitary arrangements are as
good as money could produce, and the
greatest efforts are made to preserve the
physical welfare of the inmates. It is
suspected, however, that some one of the
children recently admitted had the germs
of the disea-e in his or her system and
that it developed after being received and
that the weather being favorable the
scourge spread rapidly among the poor
little patients whose poorly nurtured
frames were not calculated to withstand
its march.
The theory is given color from the fact
that a majority of the inmates come from
the poorer districts of the City where im
perfect sanitation and crowded tenements
are favorable to the development of diph
theria and other contagious diseases.
It is feared that with the progress the
disease has made many others will be
tauen down before it is stamped out. The
most strenuous efforts are beinL' made to
confine it to those already stricken, but
Dr. Lewitt and his assistants led that
they are in lor a siege.
Nor is the spread of disease confined to
the Children's Hospital, for within the
forty-eight hours ending at 6 o'clock yes
terday ten cases outside of the institution
were reported. They were as follows: 677
Clementina, City and County Hospital.
3330 Washington. 20 Derby place, 6L9
Bryant street, 1023 Buchanan street, 728
Fulton street, 718 Fulton street, rear 321
Â£ighth street and 1435b Mission at.
The Demand for Ivory Billiard Balls.
The total yearly demand for ivory*bU
liard balls, whon trade in general is eood,
is estimated 10 be about 110,000 to 115,000
balls, of which America and France ab
sorb half, the remainder being used by
England, Germany and other countries.
Bad times reduce the number of balls re
quired lo about 80,000 to 85,000 per year.
As those elephants' teeth whicn are most
adapted for billiard bails are getting
scarcer and scarcer great difficulty is ex
penenctd in meeting the present demand
and prices accordingly rapidly advance,
beinÂ£ at present mora than 16s per
pound. â Tid-Bits.

Dear Doctor: For years 1 have been troubled with
. nervous debility, suffering terribly mentally as
well as physically. 1 could not sleep nights, but j
would lay awake b oo line over my trouble, al- j
ways feeling that something terrible was going to
happen to me. It is Impossible for me to describe
the miserable feeling I bad. After treating a I
- number of years with various physicians. I had j
nearly given up all hope of being a well man :
again when 1 accidentally read one of your adver- I
tisements. After a very few treatments at the Insti- j
tute I realized I was being greatly benefited and |
to-day there is no:, a healthier or happier man j
anywhere than myself.

you ask me for some biographical data
Jet me say that as a boy I worked for my
father as a lopemaker. I went to tbe
Norwich schools and made that town my
home until 1 came here in ISSO.
"I went to Cape Town and various
points along the W est Coast of Africa in
iB3l, and remained there about two years.
Before I came West I followed the sea for
about seventeen years, being with the
London and Liverpool Packet Company.
I was for a long time mate of the packet
ship Henry Clay.
"I came here as an attache of the Cus
toms service, having received my appoint
ment from Thomas Corwin.
"I was married in 1844 and had three
sons and three daughter, of whom all but
two are still living. I have nineteen lineal
descendants in and about San Francisco.
I have been a widower for nine years."
Mr. Bromley is a past commander of the
California Commandery, Knights Tem
piar, and has been an Odd Fellow since
i 1544.
"I have been a member of the Bohemian
Club for twenty-four years," he said, "and
I call it my home. I enjoy being there,
and feel happy among the members."
Mr. Bromley speaks modestly of him
self, and he neglected to say that be was
United States Consul to Tien Tsin, China,
under Gartield. He was regarded as a
charming diplomat, and those who had
business with him found him uniformly
courteous and painstaking in his work.
Speeches were made until a late hour at
the club, and all present wished the octo
â  genarian high priest of the club the re-
I turn of many birthdays.
THE INAUGURATION BALL.
Who It la Thnt Pays the Fiddlers and
All the Best.
An inquiring correspondent has asked
bow Washingtion pays the inauguration
bill, says a Washington correspondent to
the Boston Transcript. There is a tempta
tion to answer this question waggishly by
saying that such a query betrays an igno
rance of Washington's nart in the per
formance. This city talies in the money
instead of paying it out The people who
come here, individually or in military or
civic organizations, pay for whatever they
get and at handsome rates. They more
tnan pay for those general undertakings
which the local public carries out. The
inaugural ball ia a device for levying a
direct tribute of $5 per head upon all the
visitors. It is not a ball strictly. There
is practically no dancing, and people go
to it simply to see one another.
Mrs. StÂ»nator-elect Icetiurg coes that she
may suitably maintain the dignity of her
husband's office, and the constituents of
the new Senator go that they may see the
Senator and his wile and all the other
notables on dress parade. Mr. and Mrs.
McKinley will attend the ball because the
former will have just become President of
the United States, and in his honor the
ball is given. Mr. Jones of Podunk will
go to the ball tnat he may grasp the hand
of tne new President, and others will go
because they don't want to miss anything
that is taking place. The Waahiuglon
public steers clear of the inaugural bail
ee old re-idenl has long since regarded
$5 as a figure too high for the privilege of
looking at those whom the whirl of
fortune has suddenly brought to tke top.
The ball. then, which yields from $5U.000
up in revenue, costs practically nothing,
and is paid for almost wholly by visitors
from the outside, and excspt by people of
comfortable means, by those who are at
tending their first inauguration. The ball
has no deadhead list. Another source oi
income to the local committee is derived
I from the outside public in the form of an
| indirect tax. It comes through the con-
I cessions which the committee sells, like
j permits for the erections of reviewing
stands and permits for the sale of various
articles at prominent points. Then the
privilege of selling a supper at $1 a ht aa"
lat the ball is regarded by caterers as
worth many thousand dollars. In all
I the*e ways it happens that the inaugura
tion committee raises more money than it
needs, and I think it was ei^ht years ago
that the sum of $2fi,000 was turned over
from this source to charities in the district.
Vainly Spent $1000.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 18, 1897.
MARCEAU UNDER
AN ATTACHMENT
His Former Wife Charges
Him With Misappro
priation.
Part of the Fortune Left Her
Son Involved in the
Case.
He Is Alleged to Have Secured Three
Thousand Dollars to Take
Up a Note.
Theodore C. Marceau's photograph ea-
Icry and Bis cash at Wells, Fargo & Co.'s
Bank were attached yesterday to secure
the payment of about $3200, alleged to
have been misappropriated from the trust
fund of J. Allen Fiske, the Bon of Mrs.
Gerald Martin Fennell, the former wife of
Marceau, and from whom he was recently
divorced.
Some time in 1894 Marceau was in sore
need of about $3000, as the story is told by
the attorneys for young Fiske, and sought
on the strength of his note to borrow that
sum from Wells, Fargc& Co.'s Bank, but
they refused to advance such a large sum
of money without security. Marceau, the
story continued, approached his wife,
who was the guardian of Master Fiske, a
son by her first husband, and induced her
to give him an order for $3000 on the $10,
--000 deposited to the credit of the lad in
the German Savings and Loan Society,
and also the two bankbooks of the cash
portion of the boy's $60,000 fortune left
him by his father.
Using these documents as security Mar
ceau succeeded in negotiating the loan of
$3000 on his note. Eventually the note
fell Uue, but Marceau, it is stated, was in
the same financial condition as at the time
be obtained the loan. In this predica
ment he made arrangements with the
bank by which the latter was enabled to
ca-Â»i the order on the German Bank for
$3000.
In the action instituted yesterday by
Dunne ft McPike in the name of Mrs. Fen
nell, as the guardian of her son, it is %L
lezed that Marceau has unlawfully appro
priated this sum to his own use, and has
never repaid any poriion of it or paid any
interest on the amount.
It was in connection with this suit that
the attachments were levied by the Sheriff
yesterday.
VICTORY FOR BERKELEY.
California Collegians Defeat the
Palo Alto Men at
Baseball.
After a Hotly Contested Gams the
Blue and Gold Players Win Out
by a Seers of 15â 11.
Victory perched on the banner of the
blue and gold yesterday afternoon at Cen
tral Park, the University of California '
baseball nine baring defeated the Stan
ford team in the second of tne series of
three games this season by a score of 15 to
11. Of the fourteen games that have been j
played between the two universities in
the last live years, or since the inter-
collegiate agreement went into effect, this
is the second which Berkeley has to her
credit.
Never did a Roman warrior leave tbe
held of Mars with a lighter heart than
did the Berkeley ball-players leave the
diamond yesterday afternoon. It was a
hard, fast game from start to finish, and
at no time was tba interest at an ebb.
The grand stand and the bleachers were
well filled with lusty, leather-lunged col
legians and their maidens fair. it was
evident from the outset that the game
was to be a close one, with odds in favor
of the U. C. men. Berkeley's fortune and
Stanford's success were about even up
until the seventh inning:. Then it was
that Berkeley's fatal number became
known. It was none other than a sim
ple "7."
In the corner of the grounds the scorer !
hung upon great white placards the fol- â 
lowinc: Inning 7â Stanford 7. Berkeley !
7. At tbe end of the inning he brought ;
out a fourth "7" ana added it to Berke- 'â 
ley's tally. It is a peculiar coincidence !
that in the seventh inning, with the score
7 to 7 Berkeley made seven runs, which i
won the day for the blue and gold. The
narn"3 of Hoag, Wheeler, SyKes, Henae
sey, Elston, McLaren and Kaarsburg -will
go down in the history of U. C. baseball
as the men who formed the procession oi ]
seven base runners in the memorable
seventh inning.
The batting was heavy on both sides. ;
Two home runs were made, one by
Uennesey and the other by|Loughead. Not
a single error was recorded for the Cali- i
fornia team, while nine were charged up !
against Stanford. Kaarsburc; pitched
throughout the game for the U. C, while
Captain Thompson of Stan'ord relieved
Beckett in the eighth. McLaren of the
Berkeley team, who went to pieces in last
Saturday's game at short, completely re- '
trieved himself to-day by putting up a !
star game at left field.
The Stanford team was tbe same as last i
week, with the exception of Klauber, who '
was put in at center field when Thompson !
relieved Beckett in the box.
Following is the detailed account of the I
game, with the work done by each player: i

true to you and who are false, what hopes you
may have winning your desires and what obsta-
cles are in your way and how to remove them.
How to make the best of your talents and pros-
per. How to get money. I find lost articles and

habits, and overcome all evil works, rivals and
enemies. I never fall. I have brought about
more happiness than nil other mediums, others
are be helped; why not you? If you are going to
see a medium) why no; see the very best? It costs

NO COLLEGEJIELQ DAY
Berkeley and Stanford Unable
to Agree Upon the Distri-
bution of Points.
The Stanforl Ath.et. s Wanted Two
Points for S;cond PI .ce, While the
U. C Men Wanted Three.
There will be no intercollegiate field day
this spring between the University of
California and Stanford. Such was the
decision reached yesterday by the repre-
sentatives of tbe two institutions in whose
bands the question had been put for set-
tlement. The bou.* of contention was the
distribution of points and the place of
holding the meet. The U. C. "committee
i f arbitration," headed by Colonel George
C. Edwards, wished that second place
men in the contest be given three points,
and that the bicycle race be held at the
Velodrome, while the Stanford commit-
tee, headed by Professor Angel, wished
second place man to receives, only two
points, and that the bicycle event be beld
at the Olympic grounds.
It was only after a lengthy, heated dis-
cussion over the case that the decision
was finally reached to call the contest
"off.
A very peculiar combination of circum-
stances prevails in relation to the trouble
between the athletes. The Stanford men
realized that if second-place men took
three points the dav would go to
Berkeley, while the U. C. men were ap-
prised of the possibility that if two points
were given to second -place men the con-
test would be won by Stanford.
And so it was over this point that the
two committees wrangled, neither seem-
ins; willing to give the other an inch.
There is no law in th" rules of amateur
athletics which governs the distribution
o; points, and the only case that could be.
brought up in support of the three-point
question was the previous games between
the two institutions. Last year second-
place men rot three points, as also did
they the year before. But in some of the
Eastern league meets only two points
have been given for second. It was upon
this fact that the Stanfords based much of
their claim.
Berkeley has no very great athletes this
year, but is possessed of a hot of medi-
ocre men in the different events, and with
what few firsts would co to the blue and
gold enough seconds could be easily taken
to turn the balance. At Stanford the pre-
vailing situation seems to be directly op-
posite.
The decision of the committee will prob-
ably be final, as it was only after Man-
agers Barnes of the University of Califor-
nia and Brown of Stanford were unable to
agree that they put the matter in charge
of the intercollegiate committee of pro-
fessors, whom they called the athletic
board of arbitration.
The failure to bring off the contests will
mean a considerable financial hardship
for both teams, as they bad made expend-
itures which they believed would be cov-
ered by the gate receipts on the day of
the contest.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 17. \
The aclion of the Alameda County
Medical Society in requiring that its mem
bers shall not practice any longer at
Fabiola Hospital because homeopaths â
or, aa the society terms them, "irregu
iars" â practiced there has not gained for
them the goodwill of the Fabiola Ho<
pitai Association.
In discussing the matter this afternoon
Mrs. John Yule, president of the associa
tion, said:
We have given the three schools ot medi
cine as (air an opportunity as we could.
Every patient who tzoea there is given a
choice, and I believe the hospital is run on .-is
broad a plan as any ever conducted. PiiTieiits
are left entirely uninfluenced when they go
there as to a chpice of physicians, anu the one
they want is summoned without delay. No
charge of I'avoritism chu be proved again*; tbe
nurses or riouse pbyiician. The allopath
ph-Meians of me st. ff, when they examined
the hospital, comp.imented us on the manner
ill wMctt it was conducted and on the work of
the nurses, but 6aid the medical society was
&et on their members not coining in contact
with homeopaths.
Out ladies repliedthat the physicians would
then have to forego the theaters and street
cars, as the homeopaths were always to be
â  found in such piaces, and they would neces
sarily come in contact with them if they at
tended.
The charge that nearly all the cases are at
tended by homeopath physicians is easily ex
plained, if it is true. There are a number of
niiopath hospitals and daces where that
f-chool treats patients, ana Fabiola is the only
place in our city that is open to them, as well
as to every physician in the city in good
standing, wherethey can bring their patients
and have absolute control Fdbiola
is a big hotel for invalid"? where
a physician comes and goes at his will and has
trained nurses to carry cut his orders. The
allopaths may as well say they will debar any
ot their number who goes to the Metropole
Hotel to attend a pati nt because a homeopath
nÂ«.i several glitien'.s th- re.
7 b:- acnon-"oi the allopaths is not at all in
â  accord with the broad-m nded views of the
twentieth century and will oniy reflect to
their discredit. It is not much like the big
hearted spirit shown by Thomas Williams,
president of the Pacific Jockey < luo, who has
agreed to make all tne neces-ary arrange
ments for a Derby day on Saturday, May '2'J..
at the Oakland racetrack, and turn the entire
receipts over to the hospital.
President F. H. Bateau of the Alameda
County Medical Society made the foilow
.. ing statement to-day :
\fre have no contest with tne lady managers
oi the Fabiola Association and we in no way
intend injury to the Hospital. We believe all
y.ersons have a right to say what physician
i shall attend them and carry that right to
I mean that any physician has the right ;d say
\ whom lie shal: associate with in The profession.
| While to the pubtie onr school is advertised ac
ha>lnar *n e<juÂ»l fooiinir with others fit this
hospital, we have not. We attend less
than 10 per cent of the cases that go into thjat
hospital, while in Oakland our .school has
BO i>er cent of the general practice. The resi
dent physician has until recently been a
homeopath, the nurses are trained in homeo
pathic ways, and the hospital is realiy a
homeopathic hospital, though attempting to
i onciliate the regular school. We have aDun
riant evidei.ee that patients desiring a regular
physician have been persuaJed to take the
services of one of the other school because of
the solicitations of the house physicians and
nurses.

CANNOT COME TO TERMS
Little Hope of the County and
the Railroad Buildiug a
Joint Bridge.
The Couuly Cannot Pay More Than
Half the Expense Unier tha Pro
visions of tbe New Law.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, )
908 Broadway, Aj.ri; 17. \'
The Supervisors held a conference tliis
morning, and it was practically decided
that a joint bridge will not be built by the
county of Alameda and the Southern Pa
cine Company.
District Attorney Snook rendered an
omnion concerning the law passed by the
last Legislature. It is short and is as fol
lows:
Referring to the proposition of the Southern
Pacific Company in the matter of a joint
bridge across the esiuary of San Antonio, a*
contained ia their letter of December 19,
1896, and which, as I understand, is their ul
timatum as to the relative expense which
they are willing to contribute lor any buch
structure, I desire to cai; your attention to the
fact that, in accordance with the act passed by
the last Legislature, approved February 25,
1897, section 2 provides: "That in no event
ghull the county pay more than one-half she
cost of construction, repair or reconstruction
of any such joint bridge."
Tn'ier this provision of the law the ap
proaches to any doub.e-deck bridge outside
of. the bulkhead lines would undoubt
ed.y be a portion of the bridge structure, and
under said provision of the law above-named
county could not pay more than half the ex
pense of saiii bridge, including the cost of
such approaches.
I also understand from your board that the
only ieaaib.e structure lor both pÂ«r lea to con
struct woud be such a double-deck bridge,
as is provided for in exhibit "A' 1 of tne
communication from the Southern Pacific
Compmy, filed with your board December 19,
1896. li such be the case, and the Southern
Pacific Company will not agree :o tav i,a f
the cost of the entire structure, including
approaches outsde tbe bulkhead line, which
I understand they will not ugTee to, a would
be useless for tbe board to consider entering
into any other kind of an agreement, as it
cannot leg -ily be done unier said statute
above menu ned, as the county can only pay
fur half of the cost of construction of any such
joint bridge.
From the final communication of tbe
railroad company it is seen that tbe ex
penses to the county for tbe proposed
bridge would be $55,391, and the railroad
share $30,994. Ti.us it will be seen tha'
the county is expected to pay tbe larger
half, and this it cannot do under the new
law. Consequently it is practically as
sured that there will be two bridges unle-Â»
the county should decide upon tne tun
nel plan, and leave the railroad to buiid a
bridge lor its own accommodation.
At the regular meeting ot the Super
yiso s next Monday it is expected that
definite and conclusive action will be
t&Ken.
MORE SCHOOLS NEEDED.
Hayvrardg May Vote Bonds at the
Coming Election.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 17.â Haywards
is in need of more school facilities and all
her ' classrooms Â«re at present great
overcrowded, More particularly is this
the case in the primary grades. In the
receiving class there are eighty-six
pupils, and in the next two higher
classes there are sevcniy-six and sev
enty-one. . These numbers are about
twice as large as the limit allowed in Saw
Francisco and it is stated that with such
big classes it is impossible for ttie pupils
to receive necessary attention.
An election for School Trustees will be
held in June and it is prooable that the

The annual meeting of the Board of
Trade will be held next Tuesday night and
a new directorate will be elected. Since
the last annual meeting tbe organization
has made rapid strides, and it is now in a
position practically to accomplish any
thing that it undertakes.
It is the opinion of many of the mem
bers that something definite should be

Bright Future at Hand.
taken in hand and pushed forward with :
the united efforts of 500 members that !
will be of lasting benefit to the city.
During the past three months many
prosressive movements have taken place
in Oakland, and there is a feeling that the !
city is on the verge of good times. Tiacts
of land that have been held for a genera
tion have been forced into the market,
and there is a general desire on the part j
of realty dealers to do some buying and j
selling anJ iju lding.
Director John T. Bell of the Board of
Trade has a novel idea which he thinks i
would produce some practical results. He
has expressed the opinion that the entire I
membership of the organization should ',
assemble at an early date with a view of j
having a general expression of opinion j
upon what should be done this year io j
benefit Oakland. "The expense should '
be kept wituin a moderate figure at the I
proposed banquet." said Director Beil, ;
"and there shoul he no forma! adiresaes, i
but a large number of uuki or two or
three minutes or less so as to call out tne '
widest possible expression of opinion, j
Five hundred men, representinc all the |
industries and avocations ol Oikland, as- :
sembled together and animated by the !
one purpose of doing would be a ;
cheering spectacle and excellent results
would certainly follow.
"We have had enough of croaking, and '
perhaps there has been some justification !
for ii, but now it is very plain that a
ohange has commenced. The pros
pect of the Valiey road coming to thit
city and the activity shown by larjie
realty dealers is sufficient proof that there
is something ahead. Instead ot waiting
for it we should meet it and pjepare the
way. There has always been sufficient
talk In this city; what we now warn is |
some action, and I think that the Board I
of Trade, after its annual election in a
couple of days, should start out in an ag- j
gressive manner and do something."
A NIGHT ON TAMALPAIS.
Berkeley Ladies Miss the Last
Train From the Maria
County Peak.
Four Facuty M n Who Spent an
Anxi us Night Awaiting Their
Wives' Return
BERKELEY, Cal., April 17.â Four of
Berkeley's most prominent ladies had an
adventure on Thursday night that is a gen
eral topic of discussion and amusement
among their numerous friends, though :t
the time much alarm was felt for their
sa ety. They are Mrs. Joseph Le Conte,
Mrs. <i. H. Howison, Mrs. Frederick Slate
and Mrs. E. W. Hilgard, the wives of four
of the leading heads of 'departments at
the State University.
On Thursday the ladies went up Mount
Tamalpais 10 enjjv the scenery on a beau
tiful spring day. Evening came and they
were on the lofty summit, viewing the
splendid panorama for which the peaK is
famed. They wandered from the railway
station and trom the hotel at the top and
experienced .a delightful evening of gen
uine mountain outdoor recreation.
80 en joy a Die aid the trip prove that the |
ladies did not watch th** hours co by.
When ti.ey finally decidea to return home
ward they found it was too late to catch a
train.
T c last evening train from the sum
mit had cone, leaving the four hill-climb*
ers far up on the lonely hill and their
husbands awaiting tiieir return in the col
lege town. It would Lava been impossi
ble for the ladies to make their way down
and caicfi a tain to San Francisco on the
regular ferry line below them, so they
made the best of the t-ituation and took
up quarters in the Summit Hotel.
In Berkeley Profe-^ors Howison, Le
Conic, Sate and Hilgard were all much
disturbed over uieir wives' failure to re
turn, and it was feared some mishap must
have occurred to the party. No commu
nication or attempt to follow the travelers
that nignt was jossible, howeve-, and the
only course open was to patiently wait
until Friday morning.
On Friday the ladies caught the first
train down from the lofty eminence on
wh'ch they bad passed the night, arriving
in Berkeley i.one the worse lor their sleep
on tho highest bit of ground near the
Golden Gate.
Win* Destroyed.
BERKELEY. Cal., April 17.â Much talk
has beau occasioned by tne pouring into
Strawberry Creek of the viticaltural de
partment's wine during yesterday's fire.
The liquor was so disposed oi by order of
Professor Hilnard, the packages having
been opened and many of those on the
scene having begun to drink. There is
great imiisnation at the imputation cast
uuon the student body that it was unsafe
to leave the wine be ore them. It is said
that the drinkers w.re most of them not
collegians, but spectators attracted from
the town.
Another Fire.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 17. _ The
grocery-siore of Ed Brennan, at ban Pablo
and University avenueÂ«, was burned to
the ground early this mornine, while the
owner slept in his residence close by, and
was not noUhed. An alarm was sounded
and the Beacon Fire Coraiany responded,
but Mr. Brennan did not wake. No one
thought to tell him of the blaze, and he
was t:iiÂ« morning expecting to do a day's
business at the old stand, only to find a
! heap of ashes where he had loosed up his
j store the night before. Tbe loss was about
| $1400, with $000 insurance.
Work Nt-Uv.'.l.
BERKELEY, Cal.. April 17.â The new
annual report ot the agricultural depart-
I mÂ«m was to have been completed next
month. The destruction of records at the
tire yesterday will cause a considerable
delay in sending the manuscript to the
primer r.nd may result in no report being
issued until next year. Professors Hil
fard and Wickson spent the day in en
deavoring so disentangle the confusion of
rescued property, but it is impossible As
yet to ascertain bow complete the losses
are.

CLARK EXPLAINS
HIS ROAD LAW
Interior Counties All Take
a Diff3rent View of
Its Workings.
The Author Makes Puttie His
Ideas and Says It Is Clear
as Day.
It Will Force Every Citiz n to Take
a Personal Interest in tne Condi*
tion of the Roads.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 17. f
Since the passage of the Clark road law
by (he Legislature all kinds of criticisms
have been made and complications an
ticipated by Supervisors in nearly every
county of the State. Tae interior press
has published hundreds of columns upon
the new law snJ in no case have the
opinions of two editors been the same.
in Alnmeda County the /natter has been
very generally discussed â in many in
stances condemned, in a few commended,
but by most people interested in it it has
been regarded as inoperative.
Assemblyman Clark of Niles has
watched the progress ot public opinion re
garding his bill and to-day he made a
statement in which he tries to make plain
a great deal that is at present ambicuous.
"There may* bo some crudities in the
act," he said, "which we will discover
when it is in operation. Its provisions
on the whole are very simple. On the
last Saturday in Way three Trustees are
elected to hold office for one, two and
three years respectively. Thereafter one
Trustee will De elected each year to hoi i
orficÂ§ for three years, as .our present
school Trustees are elected.
"Tuere will be no expense attend
ing the election, which will be as
simple as the present School Trustee
election. The Trustees shall have charge
of all road work, construction, sprinkling,
etc. As nearly as possible ail work will
be done by contract, by open bids, to the
lowest bidder. This will insure better and
cheaper roads for the money, as it is a
well-known fact thai Town Trustees who
contract for their street work can do the
same amount of work for one-half to one
third of the price wo pay for our road
work. The taxpayers demand that sip
shod methods snould give place* to busi
ness me i nods in roadw^rk. The compen
sation for ttie T. u>tees is $25 per year for
each Trustee; one of the three acts as
clerk, and for nis services be receives $25
additional per annum. The compensation
is intentionally email. We wish to take
the roads out of politics. There are in
every community men of standing and of
worth who take enough interest in the
communiiy and its roads to serve on these
boards without wishing to become rich.
â¢'The Trustees are responsible for all ex
penditures on the road and must rerort
annually to the Supervisors their receipts
and expenditures. The Trustees provide
for the collection of road poll taxes, which
hereafter shall be u-ed for the benefit of
the roads. Tlu-> tax may be worked out
on the work or paid. The people may on
election raiee or lower their road tax, thus
al owine eacn distrci to decide whe.her it
shall have an expensive or econom.cal ad
ministration. I have heard it said that a
district would be taxed lor the entire cost
of any county bridge erected within its
limits. This is absurd, as the bridges arc
county nropÂ«rty. built from county funds
I by the Board oi Supervisors, and will no;
I in the least affect this new Jaw.
"There can be no election held until
| May, 1888, as the Governor neglected to
I sign the bill until it was too late for an
election to be held in May of this year.
The fundamental idea ol the entire law is
to bring the control of the roads bacK to
the j>eople. I believe the law will recom
mend itself to all our cit.'zens and tux
payerswho will give the law a lair ttial.
I will add in conclusion that the Com
mittee ot Roads and Highways of the
last Assembly also succeeded m having
passed a wide-lire w*g >v bill, which does
no. go into effect till 1800."

' 808 Broadway, ADril 17. )
Miss Sadie Dolan, the yonng lady who
horsewhipped William Mahoney last
Thursday night, appeared in the Police
Court to-day. Mahoney was not present.
and when the young lady, who has a very
modest appearance, quietly took the stand,
she surprised the court ' and lobby by
firmly pleading guilty to the charge.
Deputy D strict Attorney Moore,' who is
usually a very zealous prosecutor, had a
little consultation with the defendant to
try to induce her to withdraw her plea and
to plead not guilty. -The. young lady re
plied that she v.-a- quite free to admit that
i -he had horsewhipped Mahoney and re
quested her plea to staid.
Judge Allen suggested that it might be
as well to bear the evilence in the case,
but Attorney Garrity for Mahoney, said
I he could not to on at present unless the
court desired to pass on tie case without
j hearing me evidence.
The Judge m the politest of tones, asked
the young lady why she had whipped
| Mahoney.
"Because be scandalized my name, air,
without any reason whatever," was. Mi-s
Dolan's answer. * The court 'was silent
for a few moments, . afer which it - sail :

*T*HE NERVES ENTER INTO AND CONTROL THE ACTION AND VITALITY OF EVERY
* muscle and organ of the system. The nervous system is the lite of the body, and what-
ever deranges it deranges every natural function. Excesses and abuses of the body and brain
produce a debilitated condition of the nervous system wi'h its train of attending evils, and
this condition is commonly known as Nervous debility. >
Manv strong-appearing men fret and become alarmeif. because they don't feel as well as
formerly; and yet their physicians tell them they have no 1 organic disease. They are weak,
listless, sleepUss. These conditions become more pronounced from day to day while many,
new symptoms develop. The memory becomes defective, there Is a feeling of self-aistrust, an
aversion to society and a loss of ambition. Attacks of the '-blues" are of frequent occurrence.'
Ou first rising there is a feeling of extieme weariness. There are pains in the back and head
and aches in different parts of the body; a dimness of vision, irregular heart action, a stunted
growth and loss of powor. '
The story of the physical suffering and mental anguis.i of victims of Nervous Debility is.
alas, a too common one. Wnen weighted down with the sorrows of this dread disease it is
then that they come to realize that "nature is a frugal mother and never v.'ithout measure. "
Her laws have been violated, and the victim who, either throueh errors and indiscretions of
youth, excesses of mature years or dissipation, has been brought to this 6 ad state, is paying
the penalty of his vices and fo.lies. If you are a sufferer fron? Nervous Debility

Frank P. Slavin Telegraphs His Will

of the Match.
Charles Rocbette was given the decision
over Fred Muller on a so-called foul at
last night's boxing carnival of the Man- :
hattan Club, held in Woodward's Pa- j
vilion. The decision was made by Referee ',
Gus Herget in the ninth round of tb,e
fight.
The first three preliminary bouts wore
amateur, and of four rounds duration
each. John Lahey and J. Kane, both of 1
the Manhattan Club, led off in the even- j
ing's sport. They gave a very tame ex
hibition, which was decided a draw by
Referee "Bogy" O'Donnell.
The next was between J. Reilly and
Joe Sullivan, both presumably weighing
130 pounds, though Sullivan was much
the heavier. It was a gamely contested
battle, and Referee O'Donnell'js decision
of a draw failed to find favor, with the .
audience, which thought Reilly thÂ« clever .
man. j
1 Ben Lewis (colored) and Patsy Daly,
128 pounds, made a battle that {'afforded
much amusement. The first round was
fast righting, and the colored lad simply .
chopped his opponent to piece;", tout Daly, !
though adjudged the loser, stayed with it j
till the finish. ) - :
Jack King and Yank Savage,' the Utter i
of Australia, gave a very clever Exhibition.
Both men were quiet, lively boxers, but :
Savage was the harder hitter and did the I
most execution. Referee O'Domnell gave '
him the decision, and the house was
about evenly decided on the question.
Fred Vaughan of the Manhattan Club
was unable to appear in the ring owine to \
illness, and t'-ncK Everson refused to take ,
on any other man in his stead. To fill â 
the gap Robert McCrossen and Fred Law
lor tapped each other iovinely lor four
rounds.
Preliminary to the event of the evening
"Professor" Billy Jordan climbed into
the ring and announced that the Califor

middle of June. Frank Raphael and
sammy Maxwell are matched to fight ten i
rounds at the sam^^Tme.
Then cametbxT "event of the evening." !
Muller ano>stochette were both the recip- j
ients ofJ6nd cheering as they stepped j
intO^liie ring. The former was seconded
.â fey Charles Turner, James McDevitt and
Charlie Wiggins; the latter by Sam Bar
bour. Martin Murphy and Frank Raphael.
At the outset Mulier took the offensive,
and kept it all during the tight. In in
fighting he managed to land heavily on
' the head with bis right several times, but
at long range Rochette had it all his own
way.
Muller frequently rushed Rocbette to
the ropes and fouled him repeatedly, being
cautioned against this practice by Referee
Uergot several time*. Once he bit
Kocnette while the referee was trying to
separate them, and brought him to his
knees groggy.
Kochette delivered after the first round
a series of left hooks on Muller's face and
stomach, that would have made a less
game man cautious, but Muller was a
glutton for punishment and frequently
managed to retaliate heavily.
In the ninth round he struck Rochette
in a breakaway, and the referee stopped
tike fight and awarded it to Rochette.
Pandemonium instantly reigned, and
Captain Grillen and his men had to clear
the . ring of seconds and backers, who
threatened to engage in a free fight.

"HOME, SWtEi HUME '
: A. Tribute to th* Song and the Author by
thÂ» I. at- Senator TonrhÂ»rM.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ
Sir: I venture to sand you the tribute of
tbe late Senator Vo*orbees to John How
ard Payne, author of "Home, Sweet
! Home." It is a piece of oratory as beautiful
1 ana touching, perhaps, as the English
1 language contains. I was formerly a citi
( zen of Indiana and intimately acquainted
I with the "Tall Sycamore of the abash."
I I am an ardent admirer of hit, and have
in my possession copies of ail his great
speeches. The speech referred to was de
livered by the famous Indiana orator on
June 23, 1885, at Greenville, Term., in the
| course af his address to the jury in de
fense of Captain Edward T. Johnson, who
was on trial for the murder of Major
â¢ Henry, tne destroyer of his wife and
I home. Speaking of John Howard Payne
I ana bis immortal song, Mr. Voorhees
I aaid:
He wrote one Boiif in which he embodied
j and unbosomed the most precious desire and
â¢ the most undying emotion of the univerral
heart of man, woman and child. He wrote
"Home, Sweet Home." There are but four
teen lines in this blessed song;, including the
chorus, but it will lire as long as these blue
mountains bttnd. "Home, Home! Sweet,
Sweet Home I" Its strains have visited all
lands and encircled the globe; they have
ravished the listening ear in lhe palaces of
royalty and wealth and in ihe peasant's
lonely hue. John Howard Payne sung the
song of home; he interpreted the human
Heart. "There is no place like home!" the
poet cries; and the whole world cries in
unison. "Be it ever so- humble, there is no
place like home!" Can this be true, can this
song live, if the denle.r's step may cross the
threshold of home with impunity? The
habitation may be built ol boards, or
its walls may be constructed of unhewn
logs; It may be a snieiding on the
mountain side or a hovel in the valley
below; the bleak winds of autumn and winter
may blow throueh it; the rains may descend
through its frail roof, and a leather string
may be its latch-fcey b> day and by night; but
it is home, the home where tlie wife and
mother loves and nurses, where children are
born ad bloom in strenjrth and beauty, where
joy and smiles greet their coming, and groans
and tears their departure. * â¢ â¢ I appeal
to you to permit my client to maice one honest
tight for the purity of home. In his early
youth he fougnt under the beautiful, the
btarry flag, emblem of united power and glory,
and wiili eager enthusiasm oitered nis young
life la the cause <>t his country as he saw the
right. On the 23d day of S2ptember. 1884,
ihis sad and lonely man, bereaved ana
strickeu beyond cure in this world,
made one battle, down in yonder mountain
gorge, twelve miles nway, nol merely to pua
l>h the destroyer of his own dear home hut in
vind cuion of* the principle which, makes all
home.-, secure Iroru intrusion. He fought for
"Home, Home, Sweet, Sweet Home"; and
when the report of his double-barreled gun
echoed on that autumn morning throughout
these mountainsoi (irt-en County and through
out tlie State ol Tennessee and all over the
Union it was welcomed as a tit accompani
ment to the spirit, letter and melody of the
immortal soug. â¢ * * Had the vil.ain cut
his victim's tnroat, had In? poisoned her to
death, she wouid still nave been v precious
memory, mourned by husbin<:, con and lov
ing friends â¢â¢till pity's self be dead." while tne
sweet June roses would have bloomed over
her honored grave with no taint of impurity
in their perfume. Had he burned the defend
ant's borne it could have been built again;
had he robbed him aid taken all
his worldly possessions be would siill
hitve had honoi loft. Human history
inak'.-s but one an<wer. The darkest crime,
the one without ) ttrdon or mercy from God or
man, is the invasion of the home and its de-
siruction and pollution. With the downfall
of the wife and mother the home crumbles to
ashes. The divinity which presided and filled
it with light and joy i* no more. This de
fendant is homeirs*. "The walls n re standing-,
but they are barren of rest or peace to him.
He could not dwell m such a nun, nor survive
where his pnst Joys and hope all now lie with
ered aud dead. The altar of home has been
desecrated, the hearthstone has been defiled,
and the name of him who did it is here in
voked to sanctiou this prosecution. Edwin
Henry died as be ought to have died. He who
ommil! the worst and most pervading, far
reaching and destructive crime ought to die,
and 1 have the highest authority for my
w ords.
Of course the printed words themselves
give but a faint idea of the impression
made upon the audience when the speaker
uttered thÂ»m. But those who have lis
tened to Voornees in one of hiÂ« impas
sioned addresses to a jury will never for
gtt it. Portland 0. Hunt.

COUGHED UP AN
OPEN SAFETY-PIN
Little Elmer Pare's Case
Shows Nature's Sur
gical Power.
The Object Swallcwed Six
Months Previously Ea fled
the Physicians.
No Incoavenieac-* Suffered by the
Child Either Bsfore or After the
Wonderful Operati n.
Elmer Par*, the infant son ol Attorney
A. S. Pare, living at 1112 Campbell street,
West Oakland, is a mystery to his parents
as weil as to the family physician, Dr.
A. E. Scott of this City.
Aoout a year ago when he was but
three months old he swallowed an open
brass *afety-piu whicn he had taken from
lis clothing. Tlie doctor was called in,
but as the child did not show any signs of
pain or inconvenience in swallowing, i:e
came to the conclusion that there must be
a mistake. The fniher was of the ?ame
opinion, but Mrs. Pare was so certain that
the child had swallowed the pin that a
thorough examination was made of the
babe's throat, out of no avail.
Mrs. Pare was still of the same mind,
however, and the child was carefutiy
watched, as it wa- then supposed that the
pin wo"id either be thrown up or death
come within a week, but nothing hap
pened. A month went by, ana the pin
bad been forgotten.
Aiteralapse of about six months the
child was taken wi:h a severe lit of cough
ing, and Mrs. Pare being seriously alarmed
and also unable to ptiTÃ auy relief, hume-i
next door ana called ier friend, Mrs.
Hassler. Almost as soon as she had
picked t' c child up he couched up con
siderable blood, and with it came the
long-looked-for pin. The pin was badly
corroded and blackened. Then the "l
told-you-sos" were m order. "I told my
husband," said Mr?. Pare, "that the baby
had swallowed the pin, but he seemed to
think it was impossible.
"The reason I was so certain was be
cause the nay before I had purchased a
dozen of those pins and the next night
one was gone from the baby's slocking.
As he wouid put everything in his mouib
I thought this missing pin was no execu
tion. Although I did not s-e him with
the pin I was almost certain where it had
gone. 1 searched all nis clothes and even
went so far as to remove all the bed
clothes, but could never find bnt eleven
pins. At one time I was almost persuaded
to resort to the X ray, but I am now glad
that 1 did not, for if the pin had been lo
cated an operation may have been per
formed, with possibly fatal results."
"The only conclusion I can come to,"
said Dr. Hcott last evening, "is that the
child swallowed the pin point downward,
which undoubtedly stuck in the larynx.
The point of the pin is more corroded
ihan any oth?r part, which goes to Drove
that it was stuck in the flesh or mucouo
membrane.
"The more the child swallowed the far
ther the pin would be inserted, until
nature assarted Itself an i suppuration set
in. TliiÂ» gave tne pin a chance to become
loosened and when the child coughed so
severely from the irritation the pin was
thrown out.
"I can only snrmise the reason for the
pin staying so long in the child's throat.
Although he may have loosened the pin
many time* by cougbinz as soon as be
would swallow the pin would be forced
back in place again. It is a most wonder
ful case and a miracle that the child suf
fered no evil consequences."

that have been written in the
perpetuation of a custom as old
as the iestival itself, rarely has
cne been ventured from a can
didly secular point of view.
From the original dissertation
on this page of The Call to-day
it may ht discovered that the
secular view is really not a terri
fying one after all has been said.
How many have viewed the
Savior's attitude toward man as
our Easter poet has viewed rt
tc-day? Without sentiment, but
with a practical demand accord
ing to justice, the Lord here
points out to man the chosen
path and says, ** Dii I not tread
that path before thee, with
bleeding feet? "Why shouldst
thou be excused from dcing so ? n
The human frailty, the de
pendence of mankind upon the
triiling turns of fate, which are
so simply depicted in the Easter
story on the next page cf this
supplement to The Call will
impress the reader as no sensa
tional cr exciting tale could do.
The Easter of Nature as por
trayed on the second page will
prove a fitting companion piece.
Easter from a secular point of
view bids fair to furnish a disserta
tion which he who runs may stop
running to read standing still. Not,
however, to discover why a secular
view of a church function should
interest any one. If he should go
to that unusual trouble sincerely of
course the view would speedily
cease to engage his thinker so un
profitably, for he would perceive
that it was only the promise of
some uncommon commotion that
had appealed to him from the men
tal spectacle of a worldling about to
poke a pen into a religious bee
hive.
The love for innovations and the
enjoyment of unconventionalities
exploited by some one else are or
dinary human prerogatives, which
no one has the right to call either
failings or virtues. Suffice it for
mere man to recognize that they
afford him and all of his kind a
large share of the pleasure which
this capricious life admits of.
As a matter of fact, though, the
secular mind is in no position to
discuss a divine festival of any de
scription in its strict religious sense.
The secular mind solemnly believes
that it is. .In truth, it assumes
quite a superior air, and intimates
that it has the whole affair com
prehended in the hollow of one
hand, and that the same is but a
mere incident to the many more ex
tensive things which the secular
intellect has gathered about it.
Secularism is not necessarily agnos
ticism, but it resembles it in so far
as agnosticism imagines that each
great doctrine which it opposes is
only a small detail among many
which comprise the whole scheme
of agnostic reasoning. Secularism
is prone to measure things with a
"yardstick" as wide as the uni
verse, and thinks it can mark
Christianity cff in inches. The
question of a God is to it as one
apple among a basketful equally
worthy of consideration. And fre
quently it judges the one apple
by comparing it with some other
one. The universal significance
of the immeasurable thing which
it contends against fails to impress
it. It is small wonder, therefore,
that mere theoretical arguments by
agnostic or secular dissenters
against religious doctrines are so
generally superficial and uncon
vincing.
It is odd, of course, that the secu
lar observer should presume that
he knows more about Easter than
do those whose teachers designed
the festival and who are them
selves perpetuating it. What he
really knows is indubitably not
about it, but against it and apart
from it. Hence the secular view of
Easter must be full of irrelevancies
and void of descriptions. The soul
of Easter is its religious signifi
cance, which is never repudiated
by those who feel it, and conse
quently can never be repudiated
authentically. What secular ob
servers may construe from it are
such irresponsible reflections as
these.
As a holiday, divested of its
prime significance and accepted as
the world of fashion is pleased to
welcome it, Easter day is as valu
able as any other holiday, and no
more so. All holidays are alike in
that respect. They may be or
dained at a week's notice by the
President of the United States or
be founded upon the doctrines of
Jesus Christ in the year I â it is
all the same from a fashionable
standpoint, for fashion, while it
may pose in church as a religious
detail, is not Christianity by sev
eral lengths. The serene harmony
with which religion and fashion
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 18, 1897.
dwell side by side in church and
ride in the same carriage in the
park on Easter or any other Sun
day furnishes a problem which no
one dares to understand, even if he
imagines that he could do so by
bold figuring. A flat charge of in
consistency would, if proven,
smash in a twinkling something
that centuries full of kings, sol
diers, scholars and prelates have
pinned their scepters, their swords,
their learning and their faith to.
We all feel that there is a discrep
ancy somewhere â that the church
harbors certain proceedings which
we do not care to explain in public.
When asked how we reconcile the
celebration of Christ's resurrection
with a display of finery worn upon
the heads of our women we prefer
to shrug our shoulders and waive
the query aside as something we
do not pretend to understand. Any
answer that we might make would
serve the questioner nobetter. The
whole thing is impregnable, forti
fied by custom and clinched by
practice. The world doesn't rec
ognize the incompatibility of the
twin church-goers, fashion and re
ligion, wherefore to all intents and
purposes they are not incompatible.
And inasmuch as we can assert
nothing absolutely definite as to the
virtue of religion or fashion, we can
assert nothing definite as to the re
lation of one to the other. What
we think concerns only ourselves
and makes no difference in the gen
eral result, nor would it do so if we
were to howl it from the housetops
until doom were split Uke a rock
by the blast of our voices. Since
whims and not judgment influence
man in his administrations, social
as well as political, what a person
thinks according to logic seldom
matters in the disposition of the
world's impassively revolving af
fairs.
Most of us know that the festiv
ities attendant upon Easter had re
markable origins, albeit none of us
are willing to assert positively
what they were. They have been
described by historians of so many

kinds of veracity that we are in
this late age at a loss to decide
upon which kind we prefer. True,
the inception and inspiration of
Easter itself are well known.
First of all, it was set apart as an
anniversary, as all regular holidays
must be, and the great event which
it has since immortalized by that
process of annual recurrence is
one of the vital punctuation marks
in Christian history.
But the ceremonies incidental to
it, mostly of subsequent concep
tion, have as many origins imputed
to them as there were chroniclers
in the early days to describe them.
Like the bones of Columbus, their
location is amiably Ã¼biquitous, as
pliable to the ingenious fancy of
each historian as Christopher's
relics are accommodating to the de
mands of each earthly spot which
claims the proud distinction of be
ing their grave.
The idea of the Easter egg is
particularly variable and owes its
origin to no less than a dozen
sources. In that, however, it
does not fail to afford a manifesta
tion of divine forethought, for it
furnishes a rich field for the writer
of the annual article on Faster,
who is as regular every Easter
morning with his grave narration
of the festival's history from first
to last as is the passing of the
earth around the sun. And the
versatility of the ancients in fur
nishing him "historical facts" to
base his yearly resumes upon gives
him a chance to vary his accounts
of the origin and subsequent de
velopments of the ceremonies, and
makes it not unlikely that he will
be continuously entertaining if his
memory be not long enough to
reach back to his articles of pre
ceding years.
The majority of us, whether
professedly secular or not, are con
tent to take Easter as we find it
to-day â according its anniversary
significance the fullest respect,
recognizing in it the spirit which
inspired it and which will live in
its heart no matter how many
fancy layers of bark are wrapped
around it, and caring seriously for
only that prime cause of its ex
istence â without regard for the
origin of the various manners of
celebrating it. And in taking the
day as it is we shall proceed to en
joy it to the utmost. As a day of
enjoyment it is of course better
than other days only in so far as it
is specially recognized as a par
ticular occasion for seeking enjoy
ment. It is our duty to enjoy our
selves every day, and as much
more on holidays as their radiant
particularity will permit.
Of course there is one phase
which we children of a new world
will not be likely to think of in our
own pursuit of Easter for the gay
ety which it affords us. That is
the circumstance that in the Old
World, on or near the spot where
the inspiration of Easter took place,
the annual anniversary is not ob
served as a day of gayety at all.
In Jerusalem Easter is observed for
what it seriously, actually is, and
not according to the convenience
of any mortal plan for plea
sure or any temporal fashion.
The material reminders of the
crucifixion are right there before
those people. The reputed tomb
from which Christ rose on Easter
and the arches under' which
He walked on his way to the Cross
are still in evidence. To-day the
little children of Jerusalem will be
taken to these arches and led under
them and told what they signify.
The story of the wonderful
events which occurred there ages
ago will be illustrated by actual
relics, grimly and gauntly eloquent
with their dumb evidence pre
served upon them through all the
centuries. One writer has truly
said that these are "the only chil
dren in the world to whom the true
significance of Easter Sunday is
made apparent by an object lesson,
and such an. object lesson as no
Christian mind ever has the ad
vantage of realizing."
The same writer goes on to say
that "although nearly nineteen
centuries have elapsed since Christ
passed from among men the city of
Jerusalem does not exhibit notable
changes from its appearance, as
judged from history, at the begin
ning of the Christian era. It is
still the terminus of pilgrimages.
The same queerly gowned and
strangely hooded figures are seen
upon its streets now that were
familiar to those who lived when
Pontius Pilate was a disciple of
justice, so called. The famous
localities which the world has
learned to know are absolutely as
they were then. All about,
through and through, it is a place
of memories, and one which stirs
the emotions of even the most
flinty hearted." Perhaps it is as
well since we desire to make
Easter a holiday for gay rejoicing
that we do not live in Jerusalem
to be "stirred" by its memories.
Probably we are better off and
more at peace where we are.
So let us all take Easter in what
ever light we may prefer. Most
of us really regard it more as a
holiday than as anything else.
How we do it or why doesn't mat
ter, and those who conscientiously
preserve for it the significance of
a day of resurrection above all else
are not disturbed by the lighter
and more elastic significance which
the butterflies add to it.
May all the readers of THE Call
enjoy the day and the season to
their fullest measure according to
their best lights, for in that lies
the nearest approach to happiness
that this world affords.

ON
EASTER
MORNING.
The young man sat in a dejected atti
tude at the window. He watched the
doctor as he wrote out a prescription on a
neat little pad and rang for & messenger
boy to take it to the nearest drugstore.
The doctor's cool white fingers fluttered
for a moment over his wrist. . .
"Nervous system shattered,'' he mur
mured to himself. Then perfunctorily to
his patient:. "Five grains of my prescrip
tion will, no doubt, alleviate your pain
and you will sleep. If not better in
twenty minutes take the balance of the
I powder. ' By to-morrow morning you will
j be able to leave your room .and take a
stroll in the Easter sunshine. Good-by." |
The doctor pulled on a pair of handsome
gloves, smiled benevolently at his patient
and was gone. ".' â  ./ 'â  : â 
â  Frederick Wynne sat quietly for awhile
with closed' eyes. Then he turned and
looked out of the window of his hand
some hotel . suite. He expected every
minute to seethe messenger-boy thread
ing his way through the line of vehicles J
and streetcars carrying the tiny parcel in
his hand. But his head was aching
frightfully and His vision was obscured.
The wind sifted in through an open win
dow, buffeted the lace curtains and sent a
newspaper flying from the table over the
soft, rich carpet.
Everything about this young man be
tokened wealth. His. wardrobe was fine
enough for the best. The. elderly father
in an Eastern city supplied him with
money lreeiy, and had sent him on a trip
around the world. Yet Frederick Wynne
believed himself to be the most wretched
creature in the world to-night. The doc
tor had skillfully evaded the fact that he
was suffering from a prolonged debauch.
But, physically weak and morally de
graded, he could not hide his own humili
ation. He pulled at his thin mustache
and the perspiration stood out on his
forehead. The pai:i in his head was mad
dening now. Where was the messenger
boy and tbe healing draught?
Under the influence of strong excite
ment he rushed into the street. He had
a dim idea that he should meet him and
wrest the soothing powder from him. It
was almost dark, and the City was fast
becoming enveloped in a fog. He was
conscious of tbe sudden flaming out of the
electric lights across the dark rath of
evening, of men and women who walked
in the streets, but who were as impal
pable as air to his unsteady hands and
deaf to his impotent cries. Then he knew
no more.
The first momentâ it was days after
wardâthat Frederick Wynne could con
sciously connect with his past life
came to him one evening as be was stand
ing on a street corn* r. He was listening,
with a group of men and boys, to the
showy oratory of a ward politician. The
intermittent glaro of light from an arc
lamp lit up the rugged features and lent
an unnatural pallor to the uplifted faces.
The husky voice that proceeded from the
man upon the temporary platform alter
nately wheedled â  and ridiculed. Every j
now and then there was a burst of ap- <
plause from the listeners, and bats were
thrown into the air. Wynne reached for
his own, with an enthusiasm borrowed
from the crowd. As he lilted it be was
conscious of a tender spot upon his head.
Just then the orator burst forth into his
peroration. He shouted : "From Occi
dent to Orient, from frigid north to sunny
j south" â Wynne waited to hear no more.
"Occident, Occident," he murmured
J vaguely in the ears of the jostling crowd.
Curious eyes were turned for a moment
I on the shrinking figure, and a good- !
| natured laugh issued from the men.
Wynne heeded it not. â  He* was grasping
at some elusive fact, as he stumbled on.
! Tne speaker's words ad called to mind
i the name of his hotel, from which he
i must have lost his way while out walking.
' By dint of much inquiring he found his
! way to tbe hostelry, which was brilliantly
i alight. Ha walked directly to the office.
â¢'The key to my room, pleaie.'' The
J voice was quiet and gentlemanly, but the
clerk eyÂ«d him with suspicion.
"What is your name and the number of
your room
Wynne's attitude was one of extreme
dejection. He stood leaning weakly
against the desk. He put his hand to his
head.
"I don't seem to remember," he said
slowly, as if trying to grasp at half-for
! gotten things. "Perhaps it will come to
me."
"Oh, probably," said the clerk, with a
cynical smile. "Meanwhile you had bet
ter go outside and walk up and down a
bit. It will refresh your memory."
Much disturbed Wynne turned to obey.
! On his way to the door he passed a large
â  plate-glass mirror, one of the showy em
bellishments to tbe office. He gazed in
mute astonishment at the figure reflected
| therein. There was an old hat on his head
that might have been picked from the
refuse of an ash barrel. He was without
a coat, and ' his shirt sleeves were ragged
and his trousers frayed at the bottom. A
heavy growth of beard adorned his face.
He raised one dirty hand after another,
he clutched at the air with bit fingers,
I that be might be sure that the reflection
I was his own. Tbe man in the mirror
made similar movements and Wynne
turned away with a feeling of revulsion.
He was too weak to understand it. Per
j haps it had been only a beautiful dream
that tie had once belonged to a rich and
: influential family. He felt faint; he
| would buy food and when stronger be
| could solve the mystery. He felt for bis
I purse. It was not there.. -
He stole out into the night again. The
I air was chill and penetrating, but he
| hardly thought of physical discomfort as
;h" wandered slowly down the street. Ha !
| crept into the shadow cast by the naphtha \
j torch of an Italian fruit-vender. The
j odor of roasting nuts and popping corn
j came gratefully to his nostrils. The
i streets had grown quieter, but lights
glowed defiantly from gilded palaces, and
gay music floated out from dancehalls.
j Just then a blue-coated individual with a
j star on his breast came down the street
j with measured strides. Wynne with un
! erring instinct moved on. Moved on and
j on, ever pursued and ever flesing, with
â¢ mechanical step and drooping head, until
; the gray morning dawned.
He was standing with two ragged boys
j and ai. untidy woman before the window
Jo! an uptown restaurant. The man with
l in, wearing the cook's ccp and white
i apron, deftly turned the toothsome flap-
I j ticks. The smoke of the frying batter
| floated out on the crisp morning air, and
j the hungry man nearly, fainted- for the
food he craved. ;
A stoatly built young man left the mid
dle of the street, where he was superin
tending the construction of a sewer, He

hastily brnshed by Wynne, then turned
back and tapped him on the shoulder.
"Do you want a job?" he said.
Wynne made eager response. Noting
hii> pinched face and woe-begone appear
ance, the stranger held out a small piece
of silver.
"Go lv and get your breakfast. Then
come to the corner and ask for Mulligan
Mister Mulligan, mind you."
Wynne found his friend half an hour
later sealed on a pile of sewer-pipe serenely
emoking a cigar.
"There's a pick and shovel," he said
curtly. "We've cot to finish this job by
to-morrow night and the men are on a
strike."
Wynne toiled steadily all that day with
unaccustomed hands. His energy was
born of his extremity ana his strength
was that of two. Mulligan, walking up
and down along the brms of the excava
tion, eyed him with an approval that be
could not d s^uise. At night when Wynne
was scraping his tools he approached him.
"If there's no wife or kids you'd better
come home with me to-night," he said,
smiling reassuringly.
Wynne mutely assented. They rode en
the street car to an unpretentious cottage
in the outskirts. Within it was untidy
and uninviting, but it was a haven to the
man who had been so rudely tossed about.
Mulligan motioned him to a chair.
"I'll go and cook the dinner." he said.
"It's bachelor's hall with me."
Wynne begged that he might assist, and
together they boiled the coffee and broiled
the steak over the coal-oil stove. After
dinner they sought the garden in the rear i
ot the house. It was beautifully kept,
in striking contrast to the houÂ«e. Mulli
gan seated himself upon a bench and
pulled at his corncob pipe. It was a late
spring evening, rarely warm for the sea
son. The air was -fresh from a recent
shower and carried warmth and fragrance
on its gent le wings. The white blossoms
in the tall lily hedge glimmered in the
twilight like white faces in hoods of green.
Mulligan watched the rings of smoke
from his pipe as they dispersed in the soft
air. Gradually his tongue loosened under
the influence of the soothing tobacco. .â¢
. "You think," .he said, "that I asked
you. here to-night so them fellows
wouldn't influence you to leave the job.
Well, maybe i did; but there's another
reason," and he lowered his voice and
turned his face away from the fleeting
light.
. "Every night when I come home from
work I hope to see Nell coming round
the house to meet me, as she used â
tall and lovely as them flowers. We
planted them together, and the sight of
her walking amon? them made me think
of poetry and heaven. When I smoked !
she would lay her sunny head down on
my knee and whisper, 'I love you, Jim.'
Fool! Fool! Somehow I'd forget that I
was poor, plain Jim Mulligan. The [
majesty of love raised me. .Sometimes j
I'd Bay: -It's bard to be poor, Neil; you
were meant for riches.' The only answer
she would make would be, 'It's you that
I love, Jim.' ; â¢. ;. . .
"One day there came a letter to this
house. It was from the woman' that had
been my wife before I knew. Nell. Bhe i
was unworthy any good man's lave, and I j
had been separated from her legally for
five years: She signed herself 'Your lov
ing wife.' I found it. afterward crumpled
under the table, as if Nell in an agony or
mind had crushed it in her soft palms.
That night when I came home Nell was
krone. Not a word to tell me where or
whyâ only that little crumpled sheet
under the table from a wretched, lying !
j woman not worthy to unlace my. Nellie's
j boots. That : was six' months ago. I'm
! afraid to come home nights alone, for I
don't know what I may do to my ? elf.
There's' nothing : to live ' for v now but \
money, and I'm going to get rich, mind
you. Watch out for Mulliganâ Mr. Mul

Mulligan finished bis story was broken by
a hard, dry sob. As if regretting his con
fidence be relapsed into silence. The stars
shone steadily in the heavens, and the two
men rose up and went into the house.
But exposure and toil had done their
work. It was only after weeks of illness
that Wynne rose languidly from his bed.
Mulligan, who bad been unceasing in his
devotion as long as Wynne was helpless,
could no Jouger curb his restless energy.
He would leave early in the morning,
calling out to his friend before closing the
door, "Keep a stiff upper lip aud make
the house tidy, for Neli might corae
home." Wynne learned to dread the
darkening of his expectant face as he
greeted hinÂ» without a word from the
missing one at night.
The long, quiet hours of convalescence
were a revelation to Wynne. He was now
keenly alive to his position. He held in
his weak bands a few stout strands of his
frayed past. There was the journey taken
from his Eastern home, his suffering at
his hotel and bis subsequent awakening
in the streets of a strange city at night.
Where he had passed the intervening
time he could only uuess. He believed he
had been sandbagged nnd robbed. It j
seemed strange that so influential a per
son as he had been could have dropped
out of sifbt without causing a ripple on |
tbe social surface. He crept weakly to
(he newspaper offices and scanned the
bulletin-boards with eager eyes. He ex
pected to see written thereon:

: man. His friends, crazed wlui auxlety, Bcour- â¢

There was nothing of the sort there,
and his vanity was wounded. He thought
of writing home for funds, but the Wynne
grit was slowly asserting itself. His slug
gish life became aroused. He taw his
wasted opportunities stretch behind him
like an expanse of urid plain. He recog
nized the sterling qualities of men of
Mulligan's type. He believed if he could
redeem his wasted life and build anew the
tissues of character anywhere he could do
"PERHAPS IT WILL COME TO ME."
it among these people who did not know
his past. Under the whip of necessity
that zoaded them on he, too, might grow
strong and energetic- He resolved to drop
his identity, now and here, and be known
to the world by another name.
It was not strange that these two men,
driven like cheff before the strong wind
of fate, should continue as partners. Mul
ligan's keen business eye, always open to
the main chance, saw in bis friend latent
gifts that needed developing. Wynne was
piateful to the good-hearted Mulligan.
The firm of Mulligan <fe Brown, contrac
tors, took all sorts of jobs at low rates. It
swept tbe streets, removed garbage, built
sewers and prospered.
When spring cam* again, a fitful feeling
of restlessness took possession of Wynne.
It had been Mx months sinoe the firm was
established, and money bad accumulated
to his account. He began to have home
sick days. He remembered tbe services
at tne little church of St. Paul's in Bed
ford; t1.3 lilies in the chancel and the
surpliced choir. They clung to him as
dreams of childhood do to well-grown
men. With his memories came a strong,
desire to see his home again. Many a
night when his partner was peacefully
sleeping in the next room, he was plan
ning for his future. He could take hold
of his father's business with a strong
band and a resourceful brain. Money
meant humanity to him now.
One Sunday morning as they lingered
over the eggs Â»nd bacon he told MaliijcM
tbat be must go away. His friend was
aghast.
"Why, old fellow, you can't go in this
busy season. We're sure to get the con
tract for sprinkling the streets."
But Wynne stoutly persisted and Mul
ligan finally gave in. H- bad to be con
tent with a promise that Wynne wou'd
return by the Ist of June if he should find
nothing better to keep him away.
"What can be better." grumbled Mulli
gan, "than Eyetalian labor at $1 a day?"
A week later Easier morning dawned
again with its glorious promise of immor
tality. Frederick Wynne slept late. He
bad Deen busy tbe day before settling his
affairs and packing bis trunk, for ho was
1 to take the overland train for his home in
tbe East that evening. His partner, after
his custom, had risen early and gone ont
on tbe porch to smoke and read the paper.

yet wet, and before the town below has
begun to rub its eyes and turn over in bed.
It is, in fact, the month when tbe fully
awakened year rises, clothed on in loveli

went into the living-room. There was
Mulligan, hid face beaming with happy
smiles.
His arm was about the waist of a tall,
fair, young woman. Wynne knew in an
instaut that it was Mulligan's Easter and
that this wbb something of what Easter
meant.
Mulligan proudly presented her to his
friend, and told with infinite pathos the
story of her loss and reappearance. The
woman's eyes, ablaz3 with love, rested
proudly on her husband.
It was only a brief tale. Nell had been
engaged as nurse in a hospital sines that
cruel day when she had found an erring
woman's letter to her husband. A woman
had died in her arms last night, but not
nntil she had told her nurse of her scarred
life and exonerated Mulligan from blame.
Nell laid the tired hands at rest and kissed
the siu-worn face. Then she prepared
herself to return to her home and hus
band.
A handsome, sun-burned young man
walked into the nearest church that
Easter morning. He followed the respon
sive readings, And the choir sans heavenly
strains. The little rector told in sym
pathetic English the story of the risen
Lord. Frederick Wynne thought of Mul
ligan's great good fortune, and there was
a thankful spirit in bis heart as be pon
dered over his own ill-desert and the new
I life that was born into him. He placed
his hat soberly on bis head, as he walked
out of the church door into the balmy
sweetness of the sprinz dnv.

When is a candle properly vexed?
When it is put out.
forag* plants are in bloom, and It is deli
cious to lie down amid the niled-up clover
and alfileria and note the myriad minute
blossoms that make the earth more bril
liant than an Oriental rug.
There are manners and manners of
lying in the grass, but there is only one
way, and that is to forget all about one's
self and one's surroundings and lie flat
upon one's back. Only then is it possible
to see yhe wondrous beauty of tall tree
tops against the sit, ; to note the shadowy
j outlines of the distant hills. Colors come
j out with peculiar vividness seen from
j among the grasses, combinations un
dreamt of before are revealed by looking
athwart the slopes. We catch the blue of
the aky reflected in the eras* and the flow
ers, as well as in the pools. We see the
! preen of i rass and the yellow of poppies,
i the white of the wind-tossed orchards
shining back against the heavens and re
alize how absolutely the world is a whole,
j no least wayside weed living or dying to
itself.
. Nature, out here, has arrayed herself in
Easter garments. An Eastern paper of
the date of April 4 reached me this week,
and in it was exultantly noted tbe "first
crocuses" were peeping out and other
blossoms might soon be expected. It
were worth a trip across the continent to
greet the first crocuses, but, lacking that,
we have had a wealth of blossoms this
ftprihs and the hills are alive with color.
Old Californians tell me that we '"have ne
wild flowers compared to what bloomed in
the early days." Yet on the hills beyond
me I may wade through seas of cream
cups Â»nd baby-blue-ey s growing so
thickly that neither sod nor crass can be
seen. A glance through the open door at
my hand shows great purple patches of
brodeaia, and poppies and bnttercups
mate the slopes a mass of color.
Down in the meadow below me a child
is gatheiing her apron full of the
treasures, ana her little bobbing white
bonnet seems just on a level with the tall
Dinji m&llows through which she wanders.
Within a stone's throw the yeilow iris
blooms royally, and its cousin, the biue
eyed grass, has literally carpeted the
slope. Some love the wild violets, others
the lilies of the field, and for all the glori
ous poppies are full of delight, but to me
the blue-eyed grass is the most beautiful
thing thai grows. It has a more delicate,
wavering crace of form than the true iris,
a tenderer color than the violet, and the
very democracy of its growth out here is
but an additional charm. It is a chil
dren's flower, like the jolly buttercup,
and, compared to the Eastern variety, our
blue-eyed grass is a fairly rugged blossom.
The first trees to come into leafage here
abouts are tbe osier willows. The swamp
willows follow quickly, and later, asdepre
eating the cod clime, so different from
that of its native land, tha Oriental wil

parlance. One should see these trees
wheu the leafbuds have just unfolded to
understand the full beauty of the phrase
in which the Arabian Nights' chronicler
describes all fair youtb, "graceful as a
sprig of Oriental willow"â albeit, there
seems a certain lack of fitness in speaking
of one of those long, down-drooping
sprays of feathery ereen as a "sprig." Tbe
liveoaks come out about ihe middle oi
March in a glory of golden foliage thut

old trees make their annual change of rai

foldÂ«, dropping the old one leaf by leaf
softly to the ground.
A little lizard who invaded my house
the other day was less particular. It was
a hot daj% and it may be he was too warm ;
or perhaps his new suit was just com
pleted, and he was anxious to note the
tit. At all events he seemed oblivious
of my presence, but fussed about for
awhile, running back and forth along the
table's edge, and finally went through a
series of gyrations that at Hrst led me to
fear he was about to emulate "the
squeechycumsquees that swoilers their
selvea." He stretched and twisted and
presently began to rub his head vigorously
with bis tiny front claws. Then, sudden
ly, and with the greatest apparent ease,
he turned his skin backward, from the
jaws, and slipped out of it as easily as a
lady might draw her hand from a glove.
He was a little breathless after the per
formance, and for a long time lay quite
still. At last he seemÂ«d to take notice ol
me. He lifted his head, as though listen
ing intently, bis throat began to throb,
and ha finally turned and scuttled away,
leaving his old clothes on my writing
table. Tbe little cast-off garment is a

Bin,THE PRESERVATION OF MONTEZUMA CASTLE IN ARIZONA.
A strong effort was made to get the last Arizona Legislature to pass a bill appro
priating a modest sum o' money to be expended in the preservation, at least, 01 Mon
tezuma Castle, which is the largest pud most pretentious of the prehistoric ruins
exiant in ihe Territory. The sum of $JjO3 was asked for, and hud the amount been
allowed it would have been sufficient to have provided for the partial restoration of
the noble rnin upon the original lines, which are yet clearly discernible. But the
Legislature had an economical streaK, and its few members who took any interest in
arebsological matter* wtre unable to offer any trades or other inducements to secure
the passage of the bill.
Now. however, several private individuals who realize the importance of preserv
ing these ruins, have taken the matter in hand and are attempting to raise a sufficient
fund by subscription. A few hundred dollars will be enough to preserve the ruin in
ts present condition for many years to come, while a couple of thousand wiil be
enough to restore exterior walls to their original condition.
The appellation "Montczuma Casile" is certainly a misnomer, for none of Monte
zTima's people ever reached Ar.zona. The castle is far older than any of those built
by the same race that welcomed Cortez an i his band of pillaging treasure-seekers to
their shores. It was the opinion of Lieutenant Gushing, who had charge of the fa
mous Hemingway archaeological expedition, that the ruins in Verde Valley, where
Montezuma's cas;le is located, were those of the Toltec, a race that was the forerunne l "
of the Aztecs, and in many respects their superior. His opinion also was that what
is now known as Moricopa County at one time contained a population many times
greater than the present population of the entire Territory.
And the center of this population was the Verde Valley, which lies to the north of
and appears to be a tributary or branch of the greater Salt River Valley. Beaver
Crrek courses through Verde and the banks of this stream are lined with ruins of the
cliff-dwellers, as well with the crumbling walls of other peoples who lived in great
stone and cement houses. What is Knowr. as Montezuma Castle is the largest and
most pretentious of these latter ruins, but it ta surroun.ied on all sides by numbers of
cliff dwellings dug into or carved out of the solid rock.
Montezuma's castle probably takes its name from a huge hole intheground that
has been given the fanciful appellation of Montezuma's well. There are cliff dwell
ings carved into ttie walls of thii huge well, which is now partly filled with good
spring water that courses down from a lakelet some distance above.
The old cas-tle stands well inside a huge cave formed by the erosions of time in a
limestone formation. There is an outer battlement wall at the mouth of the cave, but
this is in a far worse state of preservation than is the castle within. The castle is a
huge building constructed of a lime concrete. Jtisperhapa a hundred feet long and
fifty feet in width. There are several stories to the building and the floorings are la a

TO LIBERATE THE TENDER FEET OF CELESTIAL DAMSELS.
Within the next ten weeks there will be triad In San Fran
cisco an experiment which is without parallel in a period of
1000 year-". This is nothing less than lecal interference with
the practice of making small feet artificially for the maidens of
Chinese parentage who reside on the sandy peninsula of San
Francisco. Imagine the effect of an attempt to regulate by law
the corsets which are worn by the blue-eyrd maidens of Ger
many, the yellow-haired girls of Scandinavia, th* chic girls of
pay Paris, the red-cheeked girls of England and the brilliant,
high-spirited maids of the broad dominion of Uncle Sam!
Imagine what a taÂ«k it would ba to commingle the castes of
India, to transform the ladies of Borneo, to cure the
Hawaiian maid of her fondness for swimming in the breakers
which impearl her beloved island of Oahn! That would ail
be easy in comparison with the execution of a foot reform
among Chinese girls.
Nevertheless a gentleman of prominence in this City has
Towed that lie will take steps to.prevent hereafter the maiming
of any Chinese girl in the proud City or San Francisco. He
wishes to remain unknown tor <he prevent, but he is the presi
dent of probably the most popular public institution in San
Francisco â one which is daily visited by crowds of our most
intelligent people. Pie realizes the difficulty, but is firmly in
earnest. Befpre the week is out ho will address letters to both
of the Societies for the Frevention of Cruelty to Children, ask
ing them to interfere to prevent the torture upon little Chinese
giris.
When Chinese womon began to curb the natural growth of
their feet is not absolutely known. But the most credible
legend says ttia t one thousand years aco there was a veritable
Chinese Cinderella, worthy to wear gla<s ilippers and to ride in
the smallest carriage that mice ever drew! Paung-hi was a
favor.'te of Ting-hain-chio, in the time of the Tang dynasty.
Her feet were so small and dainty that they alone won her
fame. Golden lilies were embroidered by royal mandate upon
the silken fabrics upon which she proudiy trod. But even
pretty little Paung-hi was not satisfied. Spots there are oa the
sun, and ambition ever fails to realize its ideal.
Pretty as her feet were, she still thought that she could im
prove upon them by lacing them. Straightway the facile minda
of the children of the Orient '"caught on," as might bs >-aid in
Occidental vernacular. "By degrees," says a hoary and vera
cious Mongol chronicler, "the people (women) imitated her
example until the custom prevailed in all the provinces of tne
empire. 1 '
In San Francisco, one thousand years later, native daugh
ters of the Golden West, almond-eyed, olive-skinned, b!oom
ingly appareled in as many vivid colors as a Duich tu!ip-bed in
humid bpringtime, are weeping, croaninz, day alter <tftjr, under
going torture?, that they may assume the badpe of gentility.
In hovels reeking with filth and redolent of the nauseating
lumes of opium, in underground, clmrnel-likeaoodes. where the
poorer coolies nest like burrowing ratÂ», in the stores and marts
where chairs of ebony are considered evÂ»ry-day accompani
ments of ordinary barter and dicker, from Kearny street to the
crest ol Powell street, and from California street to Jackson
street â there are childish groans, streaming tears, hobbling and
crippled children, losing all the joys which arise from activity
to be genteel!
Every daughter of every Chinese merchant in San Fran
cisco is perforce a small-footed cirl. When the children are
about 5 or (j years old the compression by bandaging begins, to
prevent their further growth and to give
them the form and appearance so much
admired by the literary people of China,
For this purpose the foot is practically
extended to the ankle. The fleshy portion
of the heel is pressed downward and for
ward and the entire foot is carefully wound
with a long bandage from the ankle to the
extremity of the toes and back again.
TÂ»e smaller toes are crowded together
unnaturally an<i bent under the foot and
the foot is prevented from spreading out,
as when the weight of the body is thrown
upon it in a state of freedom. It tapers
to a point at the end of the great toe. The
instep is made unnaturally prominent
and the os calcis, or bone which forma the
bottom and posterior part of the heel, is
turned downward. The foot, so com
pressed, is placed in a short, narrow shoe,
tap?ring to a point, and sometimes a block
of wood is used, so supporting the heel
that the body seems to stand on tiDtoe,
the hÂ»el being from one to two inches
higher than the toes.
It usually requires two years or longer
for the feet, if properly treated, to become
cramped into the genteel shape. The
foot gradually shrinks and shrivels up.
Vhen after months of compression the

THE PROCESS OF BANDAGING THE FEET.

Partial Restoration of Which Is Now Being Raised.
sm all toes are xinbandagod for the purpose of being washed or
repressed, they are unable to assume their original position, and
appearance, but remain curled up and almost devoid of sensa
tion or feeling.
When the proem is begun at the raon favorable age of the
victim i he heel can sometimes be brought clown even with the
tips of the toes. But if the girl reaches above 12 years before
the torture is inflicted it is very dificult to make ncr feet a-
sume the "proper" shape. The bones by thistime have become
hardened and almost full size Generally in such caÂ«e^ merely
the toes ore bent under, leaving the rest of the foot in its nor
mal condition. Larger shoes may be worn and easier wnlking
done by thi* class, and it is not uncommon for a girl so fixod to
eventually discard her foot bandages Mid leave her feet at liberty
to go back to their original lorm. Tuis is esi>eciallr true of
girls who go out to work for wages and are required to walu
abont a good deal.
0' course a large proportion of the women of China have
what are called "large feet" from the cradle to the vrave.
That is to say their feet are never hamp<-red by bandages.
Small feet are not so much a national custom as an individually
elective fashion, denoting a particular profession of gentility
rather than a confeired or purchased distinction. The words
"good looking" are very frequently heard as indicative of the
estimation in which they are held. It is but just to some
Chinese to say that they denounce the custom an I view it as
nothing mott than a crippling of the energies of the female >ex,
and as productive of a great deal of needless suffering. Yet
those -*ho admit that ibis is the case cfier all feel obliged to
conform io the custom in regard to their own daughters if they
reside in the cities or are associated with the literary classes.
There la no torture that a woman will not undergo for the pur
pose of being in the fashion or beinsr thought distinguished.
So it was that the new Chinese Minister's wife, whose fame
as an uncommonly small-footed woman has spread throughout
the United States from San Francisco during the past week,
acquired the shape of foot which the Chinese poetically call
"golden lilies." So it is that tiie daughters of shrimp-catchers
and merchants, of house-servant 3 and cigar-rollers, of high
binders and keepers of gambling dens, have become small
footed. Walking through the alleys of Chinatown the contem
plative observer may be surprised any day to see a gorgeous
and stiange apparition. Pattering over sidewalks of plank,
climbing laboriously and with shortened breath, are large
footed women, erect, robust, toiling as beasts of burden. Upon
their backs are their patrician sisters, raised from the plebeian
to the patrician state through enforced and unnatural
deformity. Masses of shimmering silks and glancing
jadeMone rings, and waxen coiffures made gay with
artificial flowers, are these women of fashion, who taper steadily
downward to an animated exclamation point. They could not
walk around a block in halt a day. They are as helpless as the
extinct dodo. Yet in their eyes is pride, and the onlooking
hoi polloi. the flotsam and jetsam of the Chinese human stream,
feed pride with their undisguised admiration.
It is said that about nine-tenths of the females who are
brought up In the cities have bandaeed feet, thus indicating
more clearly than anything else that it is a mark 01 aristocracy
and fashion. And, of course, the poor people desire to emu
late the fashion and hope to become higher in caste oy a method
whic i involves no outlay of money, for no one is too poor to
ob-.aic bandages. But poverty, nevertheless, gets in its work
rood state of preservation. Nearly all the dividing walls, which separate the interior
into many chambers of various sizes, are also well preserved. The roof of the cavern
was the roof of the top story, and above the parapet are galleries on three sides.
The front of the building rises into a very symmetrically .-haped dome, and this is
tlie only part of the structure that boasts a rcof. The floors are maJe of red cypress
roles, that appear to have been hewn with rough stone hammers. ThiÂ« cypress is
said to grow only in the Verde Valley and in certain parts of the Holy Land. The
wood is finely pieserved. It looks much like the red cedar of which lead pencils
are made. Over the cypress poles are placed sacruara (giant cactus) ribs, and over
these ribs is packed closely a coating of white clay mixed with straw and leaves,
all of which makes an excellent flooring. Tut cypress poles have been barked, but
lack all other finishing.
A wealth of ancient pottery and stone implements, obsidian, turquoise and other
precious substances has tKen taken away from the miscalled Montesama Castle, but
much still remains, and the castle itself is well worthy the sincere efforts of thought
iul men and women to restore and preserve.
Dr. Miller of Prescott, a confirmed and very learnei and enthusiastic antiquarian
and archaeologist, together with Frank C. Reed of Flagstaff, who is also deeply
skilled and interested In these wonderful relics of a past and almost unknown civili
zation, is chiefly responsible for the efforts now bÂ»ing made to preserve and restore
this splendid monument ot a time-dim civilization, and tho<e who desire to con
tribute to such a worthy cause should address their subscriptions to Mr. Reed.
Charles F. Lummij, one of the best authorities on tne anrient ruins in the South
west, and one of the very lew writers who have ever described the Rto Verde ruins,
Las written the following on this notable prehistoric monument:
Four or five miles up leaver Creek from Camp Verde, anciently hewn by the patient stream
from a lime-stone hill, is a strnnge, white cliff, '200 feet high, a scmi-,u:ie in shape, sheer as a
wall. * â¢ â¢ Far up Its f*ce is v great cavity, like a basin set on edge; an.l therein the human
martens of long ngo stuck their prodigious nest. The gray ruin, half in the white sunlight,
half high in ihe eternal shadow of the cliff's brow, looks as If carved from the rock behind it.
Ttiis prehistoric American castle is five stories highâ about lifty feet. The upper tier, far
back in the shadow ot the rock, is hardly visible la the photographs. The crescent-shaped
front is over sixty feet in length. The rooms number twenty-five; while below the castle, mid
at its sides, are many osher tiny chambersâ natural crottoes in the cliff, walled in front with
rubble masonry. The foundation of the casile is about eighty feet atove the loot of the clifl't

of restriction in another way. Neces-itv lays its interdict on
many families, compelling them to rear their daughters with
feet upon which they may work in the fields and bear heavy
burdens. The girls of China contribute largely toward tha
maintenance of their parents' households. Many poor families,
however, prefer to struggle along fora precarious living, doing
all the work themselves, in order to brine up their daughters
with small feet. As has been said, small feet are not an index
of wealth but of gentility, and families whose daughters have
the proper feet are enabled to marry them into more respect
able and more literary families than if their feet were of the
naturul order.
Br.t if the movement, now in its incipiency. can make suffi
cient headway, all this ridiculous vain show must go. While
the Chiuese cynic, porine over the problems of life through h:s
slant eyelids, may wonder gravely how it would bo in Canton
or Pekiiu* if ;he Knaperor of the'Fiowery Kinedom should issue
an edict that ladies ot European or American ancestry residing
in his dominions should thereafter relrain from torturing them
selves and their children fey lacing, compressing their ribs, dis
placing their vital organs and causing deformation, under
penalty of the cangue, or the bastinado, or some o;hfr deter
rent, his thought may ba considered irrelevant and immaterial.
The deformation by the compression of feet must stop.
Information derived from reliable sources leads to tl c con
clusion that not le-s than 1000 Chinese girls of very tender age
are now undergoing that form of torture in San Francisco alone.
Here the bandaging of the feet is performed by nurse-.
The feet are first immersed in hot water, hotter and hotter,
until it reaches nearly the scalding point. This helps to relax
the muscles. At ence the bandages are applied, and made as
tight as practiced skill and strength can effect. Thereafter they
are never removed or relaxed except to apply new ones. One
thousand children in torture to bo relieved necessarily implies
a great task for the ollicers of the humane societies if they shall
be induced to seriously undertake to perform it fully. Children
with bandaged feet, being able to wa'k very little, must be
sought in the fastnesses and secret nooks of Chinatown. The
entire fashionable sense of the daughters of the Flowery King
dom must be assailed. Really nothing surpassing the proposi
tion in odd and unique human interest has amen in modern
times.
A fact little known to men and women of Caucasian blood
is that the Chinese regard a pair of little Chinese feet, made
small by compression, an unmistaKable mark of chastity.
Never in all the history of the Chinese in San Francisco has
this been disproved, skilled interpreters of the Chinese lan
guage recard this statement as axiomatic. Mysterious as the
Chinese are in most things there is no greater mystery to care
ful students than this nndeviatine feminine rule. The girls
have undergone so much physical pain and prolonged agony
lor the sake of gentility that what they have acquired they
hold dear. To destroy this distinction will be to Chinese
equivalent to abrogating the significance of the decoration of
the Order of the Garter.
Contrary to common supposition Chinese women's shoes
are three inches long on the sole, and even shorter are not un
common in San Francisco. What that implies let the average
American lady ask herself.
The laws of theempire are silent en the subject of bandaging
the feet of female children. Bandaginc the feet is simply a
custom; but it is a custom of prodigious
power and popularity, as may be easily
inferred from what has been said above a
custom as imperious as was the custom of
tight laciDg by ladies in some countries at
the West, ani perhaps not more ridicu
lous or unnatural, and much less destruc
tive ol health and lire. While foreign
ladies wonder why Chinese ladies should
compress the feet ol their female children
so unnaturally, and perhaps pity them for
being the devotees of such a cruel and
useless iashion. the latter wonder why the
former should wear their dresses in the
present expanded style, and are able to
solve the proDlem of the means used to
attain such a result only by suggesting
that they wear chicken-coops beneath
their dresses, from the fancied reeem
blance of crinoline skirts, of which they
sometimes get a glimpse, to a common
instrument for imprisoning fowls.

E. A. Phelps reached the city on Thurs

Colonel William R. Shatter of San

probably remain in New York until some
time afier the Grant celebration.
Mr. and Mrs. S. W. Ehrman of San

San Jose some time during the first part of

Mr. Bowman is the sort of gentleman
we Eastern Californians delight in wel
coming. Coming a$ he does from the very
heart of California's broad fruit orchards,
he is naturally equipped with strong and
convincing arguments regarding Califor

as he is now.
Tbe only reason for it is, so rumor whis
pers, that the beautiful bride-to-be is also
an enthusiast in all graceful sports. Trus
to her Western parents and her golden
native State, she nas placed her heart in
tbe keeping of a native Caiifornian. The
lovely bride-to-be is the much nought

"Bob" Davis, he of the fighting State,

its outcome. When asked concerning the
matter, they smile in a wan sickly way
and say dreamily, '"Well, if Fitz hadn't
won Corbett would have bad a better
chance." And yet we wonder at the in
consistencies of mankind.

things are still gloomy. Indeed the gloom

C. F. Phillips, for two years con

him to make bis stories and squibs de

Mr. Phillips has full charge of the theatri

Dr. J. M. Fox of San Francisco is a re

The weather has been sublime during
the last few days. The weeping-wiilow
trees in the parks are already clothed in
long branches of yellow green. The birch

bursting into emerald splendor within a
lew more days, and the tulips and daffo

AND COOLGARDIE
The Finder of the Mine an
Old Prospector in This
State.
Arthur Bayley's Strange Life
in Many Camps and His
Recent Death.
â 
Lift a Great F r uae to His Widow,
Who Will Shortly ArriveâEx
ploits on a Far D.*sert
It bÂ»s developed during the Jast day or
two that Artnur Bayley, the now famous
discoverer of Bayley's Reward, which
caused the building of the great mining
city of Coolgardie, and the immense gold
output of WeÂ«t Australia, was a Califor
tn and lived for a long time in San Fran
c story of Bayley's success, after
rtc Celebrated Eayley Reward Mine, Discovered by Arthur Bayley
of San Francisco.
[From a photograplt.]
years of the up 3 and downs characteristic i
oi the prospector, is stranger than liciion. I
It is singular, but it seems to have
been known that the man who wan
dered over the fearful desert at the
Antipodes, at last finding riches
that has astonished the world, for a long j
time lived at the New Wisconsin Hotel, (
Montgomery and Pacific streets, this City.
Like the average prospec;or he went forth i
in the summer to see wliat he could find, |
and in Hie winter, for a part of the time j
at least, rested himself in the City.
G. P. Hurst, a mineralogist of Cool
gardie, himself a millionaire mine-owner,
and bis brother, C. F. Hurst, who is inter- ;
ested in a number of gold properties, have I
arnveddere, and report that Bay ley has!
just died in the metropolis of the An- j
tipodes. which his luck or skill in mining
caused to rise.
So great was bayley's popularity in i
CoolgarJie, by reason of the wealth wnich |
he was tiie cause of uncovering, tuat J
within ten minute< after it was known j
that he was dea i $20,000 was subscribed to |
bui:d a muQiimem 10 him. The great es- j
tate is now beinj; settled up, and Mrs.
Bayley will arrive here by steamer
in a few week? and will again take up her j
home here. The Bayleys had no children, j
Bayley, according to the story that is |
now given here, was a '49ir. He came
from one of the Eastern States, and soon '
after his arrival went to the gold fields of
Sawyers Bar and Columbia. He took his
chances there witn tne pan and rocker for
some years, an>i then went to Shasta and ;
Siskiyou counties.
Though he sometimes worked by the
day in the mines 'or others, lie oftener
worked for himself. He was a typical
prospector and miner, and was never so ;
well pleased as when away among the j
mountains, perhaps scores of miles from
any town.
When the rush commenced to Virginia
City because of the phenomenal wealth of
the Comstock, Bayley joined it. How
long he remained "there is not yet defin- I
i'ely known. The next place he washeard !
of was on the desert in Southern Califor- |
ma, probably where Randsbure is now.
Tlit?re he was prosecuting a search for big
ledges.
About this time, however, the Cceur
d'Alene excitement bpgan and thÂ»Â» miner
sft off for that new district. He made
several locations and it is said had some j
pood property there. But there was a I
strike among the miners over tne question j
Bay ley Street, Coolgariie, Named in Honcr of the Man Who Unearthed the First Gold in the Great Camp
[From' a photograph.]
(f wages. The hunker Hill and Sullivan,
managed by John H;iys Hammond, was
one of the mines concerned. The Tiger
was another. Dut as a matter of lact all the
mines wvre involved.
None of them could work. The striking
miners were breathing forth threatenings
;.painst Hammond and other managers.
Mr. Hammond shortly afterward with
drew from the mine and went to South
Africa.
Bayiey with all the mines closed down
could do nothing, and ne packed up dis
gusted and came back 10 San Francisco.
"Then it was that it struck him," said
Mr. Hurst, "that he would co to Austra
lia. He knew of the vast expanse of desert
in the western part of that continent and
conceived that it carried gold. He and
his wife wailed on the Maripoaa and went
to Sydney. This appears to have been
about lb9L
"From Sydney he crossed to Melbourne
and took a little house, where be installed
his wife, and remained for a little while
till he could get ready to go out in the
gold district. He went to Ballarat and
thence to Clunes. Clunes is where tne
deep mines are and Bayley saw that tie
could do nothing without a treat deal of
money.
"He therefore went back to Melbourne.
There he got a map aud carefully looked
it over to find wnere the deserts w j re
marked on it. He had got the idea
stronger than ever, from his experience
on the Monave desert in Southern Cali
fornia, that mat was the place to find the
richest gold mines.
"He got a partner and set out. In a
few days be came upon the site of what is
now Coolgardie ami located a mine which
he called Bayley' o Reward. And it was a
reward indeed for the effort that had been
put forth, for in a month he and his part
ner bad dug out 13,500 ounces of gold.
'â¢Bayley then set out with an escort to
bank ihe money, and left hi* partner in
charge. By this time tbe news had got
! out and men began to nock to. They
came so thick that the partner hid to de
fend the gold by the use of a shoteun.
â 'How adjoining claims were located
and how the nroperty increased in wealth
is known. Thousands on thousands of
locations were made about them and
many other rich mines were opened.
Coolgardie and other towns sprang up.
"The output of the Bayley's Reward
continued to be enormous. Gradually
different interests were sold and the
money put with previous dividends.
When Bayley died he still had a sixth in
terest in thf mine, and this has since been
sold for ?1fi5,000."
It is said that Bayley and his wife,
when they left here on the Mariposa, went
in the steerage. The widow will come
Dack with millions. The Bayleys were
always unostentatious, however. Their
home at the Antipodes consisted of but a
little four-room cotiage.
This they occupied when not at
a hotel. At the New Wisconsin Hotel
Fred Bayley, the brother of Arthur
Bay ley. is remembTed well, but
the discoverer of Bayley's Reward
is not rememDered because the new land
lord, Thoma.-i B. Evans, has taken hold
since the miner and his wifesetout for the
Antipodes.
TO GUAED THE DEAD.
Veterans Receive a Historic Gift From
Uncle Sain.
Oakland Office Sax Fkancipco Call,) !
9CS Broadway, April 15. j j
The veterans have at last succeeded in j
obtaining some decorations from the â 
United States Government for tneir plat j
at Mountain View Cemetery. This after
noon a committee of Grand Army men
went out to the cemetery to arrange Jor
the location of the old and historical war
, material which arrived here yesterday.
For a long time the veterans have ci
; pressed a desire to have a few pieces of
oriinance with which to give character to
the final r6stine-place of their comrades.
! Many official obstacles were in the way,
and finally an act of Congress was neces
sary to enable the veterans to receive from
Mare Island the decoratons they wanted.
The nowitzers witu their shot and shell
were a part of the armament of the United
State? ship Independence that was brought
around the Horn in 1855, and has since
been on this coast, and for many years
past has been a landmark at Mare Island.
Three of the cannon were used by the
Independence when that vessel assisted in
quelling the riots in Panama. Another of
the old guns that will henceforth be as
silent as the grave near them is that
which for forty years has been tired at 9
o'clock aboard that old vessel.
These decorations ere almost the last of
their class that were ever used in the
United States navy. The Marion and
Alert are the only vessels now in com
mission that carry such weapons, and
there if little doubt put that they will be
speedily changed if it should ever be
necessary for these two peaceful war vessels
to use them.
For two years Superintendent A. P.
Smith of the cemetery has been trying to
obtain this material. He firÂ«t made ap
plication to General Rimer, then in com
mand of this military department, but as
that officer was ordered East ne turned
the matter over to his successor, General
ForsytiJ. With the assistance of Con
gressman Hilborn and Senator Perkins
the necessary bill passed both homes of
Consries*. through the courtesy of Ad
miral Kirkland, in charge of Mare Island,
the steamer Unadilla made a special trip
to this city with the armament.
Captain P. J. Montague, who piloted
the TJnadilia to the city wharf, is one of
the three survivors of the crew of the In
dependence wnen she rounded the Horn
in 1855 and brought these same shells
from New York 10 this State. While they
i were being unloaded yesterday he made
I the remark that they had been his com
panions when a young man anil he now
supposed they would keep watch over his
remains when be shall have joined his
i comrade.*.
At the Memorial day exercises at Moun
tain View th" old soldiers will place the
puns and shot in po ition. As there are
nearly a thousand cannon balls in addi
tion to the four brass-mounted howitzers
there is ample material to give a very
martial appearauce to the sol liers' plat.

DOG DAYS FAST
APPROACHING
Will Be Ushered in Next
Month hy the San Fran
cisco Kennel Club,
Not Climatically, but With a
Bench Show for Dogs
and Peop'e.
The Dog to Rale and Rule as Never
Before on the Pacific
Coist.
To the dogs! Why not? Everybody
is poing. And the San Francisco Kennel
Club avers that everybody should deem
themselves fortunate for being permitted.
For the members of the San Francisco
Kennel Club declare that the coming
bencli show at the Mechanics' Pavilion,
opening May 19, is to be a do;* show for
dogs, and a dos show to which the lovers of
the dog have on this coast heretofore been
strangers The doc, they further assert,
knows neither rank nor fortune, and truly
in this do they seem borne out. Society
has placed the seal of its august approva
on the coming show. The humbler arti
san, whose dog is his friena, and whose
entry fee therefor must be saved by the
piecemeal, is equally enthusiastic. In
fact, it is confidently asserted that society
is going to the dogs en masse, and society
is going to be followed to the dogs by
many others wi,<> are less favored socially,
but are none tiie leÂ«s sincere in their love
for that which is canine.
And from all indications there seems in
deed much to warrant. Money has at no
point been spared in the preliminary ar
rangements, nor is a lack of the same any
where shown in the premium list. Cash
prizes to the amount of $1250 have been
offered. Silver caps have been bung ud
to the total value of $750, and gold and
silver medals to the value of $560 more
will be distributed. And all wituout rah
That we already LEAD THE TRADE in

ing the price of entry as obtaining here
tofore.
In the matter of arrangement and man
agement, too, the change from the old to
tne new offers even more agreeable pros
pects. A patent-wire benching, never be
fore used on the coast, has been secured.
K. M. Oldham, who has superintended the
leading shows throughout tue Eist, will
assume a like authority here.
Major Taylor will assist Mr. Oldham in
judging the leading classes; Mr. Waring
will judge fox-terriers, and Mr. Fellows
the remaining classes.
From present indications about 600 dogs
will be exhibited, and among them many
never before shown here or elsewhere.
These figures, too, include only suca dogs
as are known to be at present in the State,
and the number may be augmented ap
preciably.
Among the particular features of the ex
hipition, as opposed to wuch in the past,
will doubtless be the quota of greyhounds
shown. Heretofore this class has been
poorly represented. At the same time it
has always been claimed, and by experi
enced judges from the East it has been
conceded, (.bat California has some cf the
finest greyhounds in America, if not the
world. Consequently special provision
will be made this year to secure their ex
hibition.
Another feature will be the method of
handling the dogs in the ring. All hand
lers of dogs when bringing such dogs into
the ring will wear the number thereof
conspicuously displayed on their sleeves.
This is the method heretofore pursued at
the Westminster Kennel Club at all its
shows, and by reference to the catalogue
enables ilie uninitiated to recognize any
dog at a glance.
In fact, no minor detail will be over
looked or slighted, and the San Francisco
Kennel Club, at its office, 224 Montgomery
street, confidently asserts that albeit
their inaugural, the coming show will oe
a dog show unprecedented this side of the
mountains.

the higher bodies of Masonry.
To-morrow the Grand Council of the
Royal and Select Masters of California,
which is the legislative body of all the
Royal and Select Masters of the State of

and installation of the officers of this
body will take place on the last day of the
session.
On Thursday the Grand Commandery

Frank Pierce, Sir Charles L. Fields, Sir
B. P. Flint, E.\ Sir William D. Knights,
and E.-. Sir George B. McKee.
A ieview of the year about closing

WHAT TSOUT tfILL EAT.
Sonic Observations by a Practiced and
Practical Fisherman.
The following is the first of a short
series of articles on trout fishing, written
by an expert angler, and doubtless there
are many fond lovers of the beautiful and
pleasant pastime who will appreciate the
writer's ideas piscatorially :
I presume that many anglers will feel indig
nant, and will censure me severely for pre
suming to admit that anything but an ex
tremely strained relationship can exist be
tween fly-fishing and bait-fishing; in fact, the
time has been when such an avowal from an
other would have called forth an indignant
protest from myself, but thirty years of en
thusiastic devoiion to the fly-rod in many
ciimes, and more opportunities ot closely
studying my favorite oport than falls to the
lot of most anglers, have long since convinced
me that before a man can become Â«v expert
angler with the artificial fly he must thor
oughly realize what flv-rishlnii; actually is.
Any small fleeting object apparently pos
sessing life suggests edibility to a feeding
trout. A trout when in feeding humor will
pursue and seize any movintf object which
from its form and sizs he supposes to be
edible.
A neatly tied artificial fly of the smaller
kind, carefully dressed to bear a general re
sembance to one or another of the many
smaller living beings with which the trout
are familiar, under me general hasty competi
tive political econoniv governing trout stream^,
will be received by the trout and mouthed
without discnminHiion. But a mass of satu
rated, bedraggled feathers and hackleâ such
as that which a large trout fly becomes after a
few castsâ cannot possibly suggest any fa
miliar prototype to a hungry fish; he cannot
regard it as one of me smaller submerged in
sects upon which he is accustomed tof-.-ed;
but the mass of feathers and hackle moves;
it is apparently endowed with life, and
the trout straightaway goes for it on the
general principle that something that moves
and attempts to elude him must be good to
eat.
It is to the above fact alone that the largo
troutflies owe their killing value. For, if trout
were soleiv insectivorous and fed only on
flies, large flies would have no place in the
angler's fiybook; but the fact of trout being
by turns both insectivorous and carnivorousâ
at times leeding on insects only, and again
at others ignoring insect diet and confining
themselves exclusively to small fry, and such
like foodâ is the reason large flies are as neces
sary to the >iir.;ler as the small ones.
The great secret of successful fly-fishing,
apart from expert casting, lies in knowing the
feeding humor of the fish. If a trout is feed
ing upon insects it is useless to offer him a
large iroutfly; if, on the other hand, a trout
is scouring the shallows pursuing the smaller
fishes iv his vicinity in quest of something
meaty and tilling, it is a waste of time to tempt
him with a small fly.
Recollect that both large and small trout
flies have their separate and individual mis
sions, and that one can be sent upon errands
upon which it would be useless to employ the
otner. The above observations are intended
to apply to large trout only, or, in unglers'
parlance, "sizable fish." Any bungler can
catch small trout, hence 1 consider them uu
worthy a good angler's notice, and, as such, I
do not include them in my comments beyond
stating that I have always found small trout
extremely erratic In disposition, often seizing
anything edible without regard to time or
place â in fact, being like tne younger mem
bers of any family, fishy or otherwiseâun
formed in character, consequently irregular in
behavior and possessing no settled habits
from which to deduce any data of value.
It U a common thing to hear the trout
spoken of ns a surface feoier or fly-ieeding
fish. This statement, being made in an un
qualified sense ol the term, invariably conveys
to; the angling novice the erroneous impres
sion that trout feed principally, if not wholly,
upon insect life. Such a statement puts the
would-be fly-fisherman upon the wrong track
from the s art, leading him to consider the
hundred and one feathered combinations
which decorate his flvhooks as being artificial
substitutes and imitations of the various in
sects upon which the trout feed ; whereas fully
three-fourths of them bear no relation what
ever to the insectivorous portion of a trout's
diet, they beine merely a lighter form of arti
ficial baitâ * substitute of feathers aud tinsel
for the trolling spoon, articial minnow, and
such like lures.
As 1 before stated, a hungry trout will
pursue and seize a small moving object of
almost any description that comes within its
reach; and, in illustration of the above asser
tion, 1 will menUoa a few of the many ex
perimental devices with which I have caught
trout.
In the Peshtigo River, W'ausaukeo River
and the north branch of th<^ Pike River, ;n
Wisconsin, I have tried the following make
shift devices, in many instances with as much
success as though 1 had the natural minncw
or most artistic spoon at command: Apiece
of Dork rind, about three inches long,
stretched on an ordinary triple-hock gans, a
strip of tin sardine can cut rouahiy to re
semble a small fish, with its two cuds twisted
to make it spin, nnd rigged by means of a
keyring at each end (holes being punched for
their reception) with triple hooks; two inches
of a red penholder, one end secured to a casting
line, the other end bearing a triangular hook,
and weighted with sufficient split shot to keep
benenth the surface: a piece of small glass
tubing, about two and a half inches long,
threaded upon the gimp shell of a triangular
hook to the shank and there fastened to allow
casting; a piece of chamois leather, rolled
tightly into a small coil about four inches
long, with hooks in one end, tied to a casttng
gans with enough shot to sink it; a small
eteel key with a triple hook attached; a strip
oi thick sole leather, about three inches long,
mounted with triangular hooks; and, also,
many other devices of a similar nature, that
could be cast and retrieved through the water
and carry tne hooks wherewith to catch the
trout when seizing them.
Of course the above were used for experi
mental purposes only, and to convince my
self of the correctness of my theory, that "a
predator? fish does not discriminate to any
appreciable extent when hunting for food, al
most any animate object being seized, even if,
as in the case of something not edible, it is
immediately rejected.
I do not wish you to think I am advocating
the use of such makeshifts when fishing for
trout. 1 merely instance theni to give a
clearer conception oi the feeding habits of the
trout and open your eyes to the fact that suc
cessful fly-fishing is not necessnrily a pursuit
which calls for shopmade lures of certain
sizes, fixed form and standard color. But,
should the fly-fisherman find himself within
easy access of a good fishing-ground, and,
through an accident or otherwise, be minus
his tackle-book, I think the makeshift lures I
hsve mentioned will enable him to imp ovise
a bait of some kind or other for the occasion-

THE METHOD OF A GREAT TREATMENT

Painful diseases are bad enough,' but when a
man is slowly wasting â  away with ' nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the ino-t severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and under
Buch a strain men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer roiled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had no:
better take a dose of poison and tbus.end all
his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of* a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
| emaciated parts to natural size nnd vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his name and addreks may
have the method of this â  wonderful treatment
i free. Now, when I say free 1 mean absolutely
without cost, because I "want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience. â¢
lam not a philanthropist, i nor do 1 pose as
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
Buffering the mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at once could
they but get such a remedy., as i the one that
I â¢ cured me. Do not try to study out how I can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary

The recurrence of a regular annual holiday always reminds us that the various
j events which have seemed to rise so importantly around us tiuring the intervening
I year have not been very important after all, for none of them have in the least decree
j affected the even tenor of that respective holiday as it has revolved slowly in its orbit
around a twelvemonth of worldly vicissitudes. No matter what may have happened
to certain individual mortals or to certain individual nations, when any one of the
reeular yearly festivals occurs the people in general are just as ready to observe it as
though nothing had intervened to divert them from the happy mood In which the
preceding occurrence of it had left them.

governor on an engineâ it holds the world level. What mortai or multitude or nation
ever ventures to ignore it?
Mankind, however, is glad of a holiday, All men may not pause to realize the deep
influence which we have ascribed to the holiday system, but all are conscious of some
kind of advantage being derived from it. This is mostly of a transiently pleasurable
nature, of course. Men, women and children in all the Christian countries are
cheered by the festivities "f such a holiday as Easter, even if they fail to realize any
other signiticance in the occasion. They are less conscious of being influencedâ that
is all. They are, in point of fact, influenced quite as iirmly as any one else.

THE UNIVEKSITY FIBE.
The very serious loss of the agricultural
building by fire at the State University
Friday last is a matter for much regret,
but the time spent in sorrow for the loss
should be brief compared to that which is
eiven to the study of plans to make nearly
impossible the recurrence of such a disas
ter. Perhaps if but a mere fraction ot the
clear, arduous and scientific thinking
which has been used in the accumulation
of the treasures of knowledge destroyed so
swiftly in Friday's lire had been devoted
to the devising of ways and means of
making those researches safe for luiute
reference a very great economy of mental
industry would have thereby been
achieved.
The damage is estimated at $20,000. but
this is merely what can be calculated as
purely commercial loss, and the value of
the burned scientific records, whicb can
not be replaced, it is impossible to approxi
mate, but it is not an unreasonable specu
lation to suppose they would reach to ten
fold the value of the building. A large
part of the results of the ten years' labor
of a number or highly trained minds was
swept away in an hour, and it is far from
incredible that in those records may have
been the possible foundations for further
knowiedee which by aiding agricultural
achievements would have benefited the
State far into the hundred thousands.
One remedy for future dangers of this
Kind is undoubtedly within reach by the
provision of fire extinguishing mechanisms
and arrangements and the persistent
training of the students for swift and
etlicient work in fire fighting the instant
the alarm is given. Such a long and labo
riously accumulated treasure is surely
worth a watchman, and if the alarm was
prompt and the student fire brigade both
brave and instructed by repeated practice
in the art of concerted action such victory
of the flames as has just occurred would
be well nigh impossible.
THE CZAR AND THE KAISER.
If Mr. Gladstone's knowledge of Euro
pean affairs is as comprehensive as he
evidently thinks it, then Europe at the
present lime is dominated by Germany
and Russia, and all other nations are sub
ordinate to the diplomacy of these pow
ers. Mr. Gladstone, indeed, states the
case more strongly. He charges that
Germany and Russia tietnselve* aro com
pletely under the control of their rulers,
and charges that' the Czar and the Kaiser
are the arbiters of the nations and directly
responsible for maintaining the Turkish
empire, and, therefore, indirectly answer
able lor the Armenian atrocities and the
present complications in Crete and Greece.
In a letter recently addressed to Damp-
EM, the Macedonian leader, Mr. Gladstone
says:
You might, and all Hellenci micht, count
upon the sympathies of the people o{
this country, and inmost matters when you
have the sympathies ot this people you can
count upon the action of our Government; but
it is not the people or tbe Government of
(treat Britain who are directing the course ol
Cretan and Greek questions.
Tnder the present deplorable scheme all our
Government has to do is to plead for its
opinions as If it were before a tribunal of
those youthful despots, the Emperors of Ger
many and Russia, and to abide by and help
execute their final determinations.
The language of this letter is not that of
a diplomatist, hardly even that of a states
man, charged with the responsibilities of
National affairs. It is rather that of an
agitator preaching a new crusade. None
the leas will the letter have its weight and
influence, lor it emanates from no ordi
nary man. Mr. Gladstone is still a great
leader, and his leadership was never more
apparent than at this time, because he is
tbe only man in Europe holding a front
rank in statesmanship who sneaks with
a clear, resolute and decided voice on the
issues that confront tbe nations.
When men are undecided, doubtful and
hesitating, almost any man whose mind
is fully made up, who has convictions and
not merely opinions, and who, further
more, has the courage to assert them and
the ahiiitv to maintain them with force
and effect, is certain sooner or later to
dominate the wavering and irresolute
multitude and shape their energies to the
accomplishment of his will. It is this fact
which gives importance to Mr. Gladstone's
attitude at the present time. While
others are hesitating he goes forward, and
it is only a question of time when the
waverers will follow his leadership and
join in his cru-ude.
The "youthful despots," as Mr. Glad
stone calls them, have in this old but still
eloquent and lorceful orator an antagon
ist in no way unworthy of their power.
Tbe throne is no longer superior to the
forum, and the man who can speak to the
whole civilized world is not unequally
matched against men whose words com
mand armies. The Czar and the Kaisnr may
plot and plan in secret as they will, but
so long as tbe people of Europe have a
leader of the courage and eminence of
Mr. Gladstone, the cause which they sup
port will probably prove tbe successful
one when the iinal arbitrament is made
whether tlie issue be determined by dip
lomacy or by the sword.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 13, 1897.
EASTER.
BEARING THE END.
According to all reports, whether they
! come from Madrid, Havana or the camp
I of the insurgents, the Cuban war is draw
; ing to a close. The rainy season, which
i will begin in a few day?, will pat an end
I to active campaigning in tbe island, and
; the Spaniards will then have some months
I in which to reflect upon the situation end
; consider well whether it be worth while to
! continue a war in which they have gained
j no successes in the past and which threat
[ ens to be even more disastrous in the
. future.
Put-lie sentiment in Madrid seem* to be
i wholly opposed to a renewal of the war
after the rainy season. News from that
city is to the effect that the Spanish Gov
ernment not daring to make an open ap
peal for additional troops to conduct the
war has attempted to raise private com
! panics, and has failed even in that. A
: call for tiOOO volunteers has been followed
, by an enlistment of only 200. The oppo
! sition newspapers of Spain have been en
couraged to make open attacks upon the
Government and to denounce the war as
! costly, cruel and wasteful. This in itself
| is an evidence that the Spanish people are
weary of the strife and will no longer sup
', port the Government in an effort to re-
I new it.
In addition to this demonstration of
public sentiment against the war there
are reports that the Government itself is
inclined toward bringing it to an end. It
is asserted that as soon as the rainy sea
son sets in, a large number of Spanish
troops in the island will be recalled to
Spain. This can hardly mean anything
else than an abandonment of the contest,
for it is hardly likely that in the present
impoverished condition of the treasury
â  the Hpnnibh Government would under
take the cost of removing large bodies of
troops from Cuba to Spain simply for the
purpose of protecting their health during
the summer season with the intention of
returning them to the island when the
weather becomes iavorable to new opera
tions in the field.
Even if we make a large allowance for
errors in these reports there will be enough
left to afford reason for believing that the
war is virtually at an end, and while Spain
may continue for some time longer to hold
her fortified posts in the island, the occu
pation will be hardly mor*Â» than that
which England continued fora time in
tbe American colonies after the surrender
of Cornwallis. The struggle is over. The
Cuban* have won. Whether the time be
long or short before independence is recog
nized, there can be little doubt but what it
frill be established in the end.
THÂ£ ANTARCTIC REGIONS-
The wide interest which has been re
vived all the world over in the Arctic re
gions by the recently published record of
the exploits of the explorer, Kansen, sug
gests speculations both as to the future of
the north and south polar regions. Al
though trips to the neighborhood of the
north Dole have been quite frequent in
recent years the Antarctic country has
been neglected for fifty years, and the un
explored and unknown area there is
sevenfold as great as that of the land still
wrapped in mystery to the north of us.
. Nansen's wonderful success in the north
will doubtless be a forerunner of similarly
skilled and daring penetrations into the
region round the southern polo. Indeed,
one of the admirals of the British navy is
now advocating such an expedition. He
gives three reasons why this arduous and
dangerous voyage should be undertaken.
The definite determination of the declina
tion of the magnetic pull would be an im
mense advantage to navigation, both on
account of safety and time saved in voy
ages, and this can be done only by fixing
the position of the magnetic south pole
by explorations far within the Antarctic
circle. The science of meteorology will
always be very largely . imperfect until
many observations have been taken in the
Antarctic world. His third reason is that
in times ot peace it is well to keep sailors
trained in efforts involving high courage
and endurance in order that heroism may
not deteriorate for lack of exercise.
But there are other thoughts suggested
by reading Nansen's wonderfully interest
ing book. He so thoroughly proved his
two theories of Arctic navigationâ that a
great current flows regularly across the
region bearing the whole' expanse of ice
floes with it and that a ship can be so
strongly constructed as to . resist the
crushing force of the floating ice massesâ
that as a consequence of these positively
calculable facts we may expect more and
more frequent ips across that new world
until familiarity and knowledge gained
thereby takes away both the danger and
tbe dread of travel there.
Nunsen found that the comforts and
pleasures of life could be attained in the
Arctic to so great a degree that it sur
prised even himself, who was so well ac
quainted with, frigid, realm?. .With the
weather so far below zero that it was ter
rifying to; look at a thermometer his men
found they could enjoy lone walks across
the Ice just for recreation, and that they
had to throw aside their furs as too warm
and go clad in woolen garments. .
The terrors of the north polar region
being thus to a large extent dispelled, we
can with more confidence and courage
undertake the greater work of exploration
toward the south. In that vast and un
known portion of the globe adventure may
, look for its ' "greatest ' glories in the immc j
diate future and expect its roost wonder
ful results. Science and mechanism will
enable man to conquer ice and snow and
overcome every obstacle in his way. Tne
north pole has not been reached, but its
secrets have been revealed. Most that
geography holds of mystery is now to the
south, and iv that direction, therefore, are
the eyes of the bold ' and Â»drenturous
directed.
A COAST ARTILLERY RESERVE.
As work progresses on our comprehensive
system of coast defenses the question of a
force to man them is becoming more and more
j pressing, and at as early a day as posnible pro
. vision should be made for a coast artillery re
! serve. Oi what use are all our costly guns
aud forts without an adequate and at least
partially trained force to man them in case of
war? The regular army men. if the civalry
and infantry are set to serve the guns, will
never suffice to man the fourth part of our
heavy guns and their auxiliaries, and yet no
steps have been takon to form a reserve force.
A reserve it an obvious expedient which
nearly every nation has adopted in one form
or another. By its means the change from a
peace to a war footing is made in the least
time, with the leait friction and with a corre
sponding gain in efficiency.
No nation has a simpler military problem to
solve than we. Coast defense evidently forms
its principal element. Without waiting for
the completion of our defenses, which will be
a matter of years at best, some definite organ
ization should be decided upon at once and a
start made toward providing an efficient coast
artillery reserve. Without this our defensive
preparations will remain incomplete even
after every gun is mounted.
Whether this force should be a State or a
National one is an open question. There are
ineny objections to putting these new duties
on the National Guard, which already has its
full share of work laid down. To do co would
be to sacrifice to a large extent th<>ir efficiency
as infantry or else put on the State the addcil
burden of new organizations. The expence of
keeping up the National Guard is already felt
as a heavy drain on many of the States, and
doubtless some of them, in the South espe
cially, wocld be only too glad to shift the bur
den on tbÂ« National Government if the way
were made clear. However, the National de
fense must not be jeopardized by the failure
or inability of any State to keep the requisite
body of men in training.
Although we on the seaboard have more at
Make in case of a navai attack, still the ques
tion o: seacoast defense is essentially ana
truly a National one. The attendant enormous
expense and the intricacies of The subject are
such that it can De dealt with satisfactorily
only by the General Government and by offi
cers who devote their entire time to it. Under
the State system a difference of methods and
! organization would be certain and mfght re
sult seriously in cases where troops of two or
more States unite in the defense 01 a harbor, j
as would be the case at several points on our
coasts. In place of that unity of command, of
training aud organization so essential to suc
cess we would find differences and bickerings
which might eusily jeopardize our cause.
A complete 'harbor defense requires the
hearty and active co-operation of both ports
and ships. Neither can act alone to the best
a.ivantage. The navy will always constitute a j
National force, and unity of action, if no other
reason, requires all the elements ot harbor
defense, both personal and materlrJ, to be
under one direction and this can only be the
| General Government.
It will always be an easy matter to get a
suffioient number of men 10 perform the
manual labor connected with harbor defense.
The really essential matter is the providing
and training in advance of a sufficient body of
officers and gunners and also of men for the
special services such as raiige-Quding and
torpedo-work.
A practical and satisfactory solution seems
to He in the formation of localized reserves for
each harbor to be defended. This reserve
would be composed of men specially enlisted
and also of men of sufficient werit, who have
served a term in the regular artillery, and are
then transferred to the reserve for a term of
years, with the privilege of re-enlistment
therein. Reserve n;en would be required to
live in the artillery district to which they be
lonÂ« and to report at certain times each year
to their proper organization for a short tour of
duty. This would naturally be at tnc regular
target practice season when the maximum of
instruction could be given.
For this they would receive a small monthly
stipand and regular pay during the period
called out. Besides giving an opportunity of
securing the force of engineers, electricians,
etc., which will be essential, it provides a way
of securing the services of men who have had
the training of regular service. With the
short three years' period of enlistment, no
sooner has a man become a good artilleryman
than he takes his discharge, and the Govern
ment not only loses his services but must
train another in his place. Training in artil
lery matters thus goes on continuously, but
there is still no increase In >ize of the trained
force. The men on the reserve would be borne
on the army rolls and in the course ot a few
years we would have an adequate body of
trained men read? to gcrve the guns at a mo
ment's notice. This body would be homo
geneous, reliable and effective.
This plan places the coast-defense organiza
tion where it belongs, with the National Gov
ernment. It would in effect double or treble
the regular forces at a nominal cost and in war
the organization stands ready and can ba re
cruited up to any limit desired. This general
plan has the indorsement of so distinguished
a National Guardsman as General Wingate.
Any other organization than a National one
will be unsatisfactory, not in accord with the
military necessities of the case, and will give
poor returns for the time and money expended.
With the correct organization as the founda
tion the rest will follow easily and naturally.

THE CONSULAR CORPS.
. Although many years have dapped since
th* la<e Lord Palmerston, speaking in
his capacity as Secretary of State for For
eign Affairs, informed the British â¢ House
of Commons that Consuls were "not gen
tlemen," yet it may be questioned whether
either the official or social status of "those
most estimable and most useful function
aries has been improved to any extent
since that date. They are still treated as
the sort of illegitimate brethren of the
members of the regular diplomatic service,
are despised as such by the very youngest
of attaches, and are usually referred to as
"those â d Consuls." In some mon
archical countries their very office is suffi
cient to debar them from presentation at |
court, it being held that the acceptance of
a consulship is equivalent to a confession
by a man that he is.not hoffaebig (that is
to say, not sufficient of a gentleman to
consort with princes and nobles), while it
is rare to find a Consul dining at the table
even of his own Embassador or Envoy,
save on state occasions and as an act of
particular condescension.
It is not the consular service of any par
ticular country that I have in mind in
writing thus, but the consular corps as a
whole. It is a profession which during
the last fifty years or so has grown to such
a degree of importance to the welfare and
prosperity of the nations to which it owes
obedience that it has frequently been
argued of late that it might be of political
as well as economic advantage to abolish
the diplomatic missions and to devote the j
money thus saved to the development and
extension of the consular service. The
usefulness of Embassadors, of their secre-
I taries and of their attaches, except for
ornamental purposes, is open to discus
sion, whereas there can be none as to the
value of the Consuls, providing of course
they do their duty. 1 For Consuls are in
dispensable factors in the intercourse be
tween all countries that are in commercial
relations with one another. The great
ness, the prosperity, the power and the
welfare of nations depend not so much
upon the area of .their territory or on the
number of cruisers and soldiers as upon
the extent of their trade and industry.
By none can these be more developed
ana fosteied than by their Consuls, and it
may be pointed' out that precisely those
Embassadors have been regarded as the
most capable auu successful who, tres
passing, so to speak, upon the consular
sphere, have endeavored' to secure facili
ties and advantages for the commerce of
their native land. Thus' an Envoy who in
duces the Government to which he is ac
credited to abolish restrictions imposed
upon" the importation of the produce
of his country unquestionably render*
a more Valuable service to the latter than the
Km bass ad or who, for instance, presents elo
quently worded notes to the Sultan urging the
introduction of reforms in the internal ad
ministration of Turkeyâ notes which are never
acted upon and which are merely filed away
among the archives of the Sublime Porte.
When Lord Palmerston made his sweeping
assertion to the effect that Consuls were "not
gentlemen." he did not, of course, mean to im
ply that there were no gentlemen among Con
suls, for there are many men of birth and
breeding among them. But what he evidently
did mean to say was that it was not indispen
sable that a Consul should be a gentleman, as
is the case with an officer of the army and
the navy, with a member of the bar or of the
diplomatic service. Moreover, it cannot be
denied that so little care is taken in making
the appointments to the consular service that
it has become endowed, so tar as social status
is concerned, with an exceedingly bad name.
Probably the best organized and most efficient
consular service in the world at the present
moment is that of Germany. Yet even there
the nobiliary and "gentilhomme" is conspic
uous by the paucity of its numbers, the vast
majority of the members of the corps being,
unlike the diplomatic profession, of bourgeois
birth and recruited from the middle classes.
Certain of the fattest of the offices of Consul
General are held by important functionaries
and titled dignitaries of the Foreign Office at
Berlin, whom it is desired to give a spell of
service abroad for the sake of broadening their
mind 8. '.'â¢â  i:
But the ordinary consulships are filled by
men who bear names that are plebeian and
unknown, save in commercial circles, the few
aristocrats among the number' being ex-offi
cers of the army, who, having run through
their money to such an extent as to render
the retention of their commission impossible,
have made use of what influence they pos
sessed to secure Government employment,
and above all a livelihood abroad. Vet, no
matter how the German consular service is
composed, it Is singularly efficient, and is kept
with Its nose to the grindstone by the constant
demands that are being made upon it from
Berlin. Its officials are expected to have
their eyes open and to be on the watch for
every now opportunity of pushing German
trade. They are required to keep the mer
chants and \, manufacturers at hone fully
posted as to the changes in the economic con
dition of the country and districts in which
they are stationed, and wherever practicable
to induce local traders aud manufacturers to
open up communications with the German
markets. They advise their countrymen as to
the best way of presenting their wares, they
secure contracts for them whenever possible
and furnish them with all the points that they
can need.
In one word, they constitute themselves the
mentors, the guides and the friends of the Ger
man, trader and of the German producer
that, too, in a thoroughly disinterested man
ner, without looking for any other reward
than either promotion or. perhaps, a decora
tion from the Emperor. It is thanks to them
that German trade has developed to such an
extent that it has now become the principal
competitor of that of Great Britain all the
world over, ousting the English from many of
their best . markets. Indeed, German trade
would probably be victorious all along the
line were the quality of the produce and man
ufacture offered equal to that of the British
article or more worthy, of the exertion made
in its behalf by the hard-working, energetic
Teuton Consuls.
The English consular service presents a good
deal of analogy to that of the United States,
with this difference: that, whereas American
Consuls hold their office merely for a term of
four years and are then sent about their busi
ness just when they have had time to get ac
quainted with their duties, their English col
league retains his position until' he is retired
on a pension on the ground of â  old age or in
firmity. â¢: But the method of -selection is much
the same in both instances.'- Men are pitch
forked into the service without any regard to
their fitness. â¢ â¢â â  \ ?T v.
Here consulships are regarded by the Gov
ernment as a meam for the payment of petty
liabilities contracted during the course of a
Presidential campaign, whereas on yonder
side of the Atlantic ; consulship! are distrib
uted in a still more haphazard fashion. In
many instances they are conferred upon men
whose absence from home is preferred to
their presence. In former timesâ that is to
say, in tho days when Thackeray wrote so
cleverly of Becky Sharp and of the manner
In which she induced Lord Stoyne to get an
Australian governorship for her husband.
Colonel Rawdon Craw ley, colonial offices were
available . for this .- purpose. Bui Great
Britain's dependencies beyond the sea nave
long since tut a stop to transactions of this
kind, declining to be saddled with people who
for one reason or another .were not wanted at
home, and the consequence is that the consu.
lar service is now the, only means left of pen
sioning off claimants and dependents of both
sexes, of providing , means of ; livelihood for
stewards and often upper servants, as well as
the song of these worthies, for getting rid of
convenient messes in . perplexing . lawsuits,
and for keeping - away from home poor or
ruined relations. ; V â¢ ' â â â¢â¢.â .
â¢< This does not mean that all of â¢ her Majesty'!
Consuls are of the class indicated. There have
.been some illustrious names among them, such,
as, for. instance, those of Hay, of Richard
Burton, of Rawhnson. of Lever, of Sandwich,
etc. But what I aesire to convey is that the
appointment to consulships is conducted by
Great Britain in identically tne same happy
go-lucky way a3 in this country, without the
slightest regard to their fitness for the im
portant duties which they ought to fulfill.
Indeed, one would almost be tempted to im
agine that neither the English nor the United
States Government cared anything for the
trade and industry of their respective coun
tries. Thus, the British Foreign Office, in
stead of selecting men who have some mer
cantile knowledge for the consulships in Rus
sia, invariably selects military officers, whose
duty, in the eyes of their Government, con
sists not in promoting trade or in opening up
new markets to British manufactures bnt in
securing military information regarding the
armaments and defenses of the Muscovite
empire, and which are destined to supplement
the data supplied to the War Department in
London by the military attache of the em
bassy at St. Petersburg. Yet Russia, especially
since the commencement of the present reign,
has become a magnificent and as yet relatively
undeveloped field for foreign manufactures
and industrial enterprises of every kind.
Useles* as are Consuls of this species to the
mercantile interests of Great Britain, they
are in every respect superior 10 the class of
men that England employs for her consular
service of ihe Levant These are not even
native-born Englishmen ; and, for instance,
Alfred Blliotti, the Consul in Crete to whom
no small blame for the present condition of
affairs in the island may be ascribed, is of
Oriental parentage, was born at Makri, in
Asia Minor, and has spent his entire existence
in the East, seldom coming to England, save
on a short visit. Biliotti is in every senÂ«e of
the word a Levantine, and possessed of all
the detects and shortcomings of that nonde
script race. At one time every consular posi
on the line of communication between Malta
and Trebizond, extending therefrom again
through Erzeroom to Tabreez and Teheran,
was held by Levantines, most of them re
lated to one another, and who had com
menced their career as upper servants, in
terpreters and consular clerks. Thus, not
withstanding the present crisis in Crete, the
English consulate on the island does not com
prise a single native-born Englishman in the
whole personnel. As stated above, the Consul
himself is a Levantine, the'vlce-Consul is a
Spanish Jew and the remainder of the staff is
composed of a perfec mosaic of nationalities.
People such as these have neither the notions
nor the principles of an English citizen.
They look upon affairs in an ajtogether differ
ent light, and, having hosts of relatives who
owe allegiance to other Governments than
that of England, they are naturally often
influenced by personal considerations to pur
sue a line of conduct that is distinctly disad
vantageous to the political and commercial
interests of Great Britain.
Columns of the most extraordinary stories
could be written about these Levantine Consuls
of England and oi other Christian powers, the
Consul-General at Alexandria of one of the
South European Governments, for instance,
being a Syrian Hebrew usurer, who having
realized an immense fortune by loaning mom-N
--at large interest to the unfortunate Egyptian
peasantry, has now purchased a title of count
for himself at Rome. They do not even come
from the better class of merchants of the
Levant, but are recruited chietly from those ill
defined individuals, half menial, half interpre
ter, who go by the name ot dragomans. Every
European in the Orient ha-; his dragoman,
who acts as a sort of general factotum, carries
messages, manages the servants, makes the
purchases, and in fact takes all the trouble off
one's hands. Yet, of course, no one would evcÂ»
dream of having one of these dragomans sit
down to the table with him. English diplomats
and native born Britisn Consuls have their
drngomans like the rest, and generally very
clever ones. Indeed, the dragomans reader
themselves so indispensable that their em
ployers generally end by rewarding them with
a clerkship in the consulate. In course of time
this clerkship develops into an acting vice
consulship, then into a permanent one, ami
finally it culminates in a full consulship. That
has been the career of Raphael BoTg, the Brit
ish Consul at Cairo; of Biliotti, the British
Consul in Crete, and of dozens of others of the
same stripe.
Here in the United Stales England is for the
nonce, if not efficiently, always respectably
represented as far as her consular officers are
concerned, although some of them are shaky
about tbeir aspirates, while a few years ago a
man was appoin ted to look after the commercial
interests ol Great Britain in a Southern State
mainly because, having failed in business at
home and having been refused a discharge by
the bankruptcy court, it was considered advis
able to get him out of the country. Another
consulate is held to the present day by a gallant
gentleman whose fortunes in England previous
to his appointment had lallen to so low an ebb
that he had been compelled to accept the hum
ble position of warder in a penitentiary to keep
himself and nis wife from starving. Tnat, how
ever, the English Consuls in America fulfill
their duties better than the majority of their
colleagues elsewhere is shown to a certain ex
tent by the fact that although most of the Brit
ish missions of the Old World arc now being
furnished with commercial attaches 'for the
purpose of making reports of some practical
use concerning the industry ana commerce of
the country in which they are stationed,
nothing has yet been heard about endowing
Sir Julian Pauncefote's embassy ut Washing
ton with any such official.
It has frequently been urgea in England that
the various Cnambers of Commerce should
be consulted by the Government in the selec
tion of its consular representatives, and the
same recommendation might be suggested in
the case of the United States. For it is the
manufacturers and merchants who are more
particularly interested than any others in the
choice of a capable and efficient man. By so
doing the President would place the mercan
tile community under obligations to his ad
ministration. And when such a man has been
found and appointed he ought to be permitted
to hold his office as long as he fulfills his
duties in a satisfactory manner, and be made
to feel that his removal will only come to him
in the event of neglect of duty or misconduct.
It takes some little time to learn the mere
routine of a Consul's office, and still longer to
become acquainted with the economic pecu
liarities and the industrial as well as commer
cial problems of the districts in which he is
stationed.
Some conscientious United States Consuls go
to the trouble of endeavoring to acquire this
knowledge, and have then to make way for
their successors just at the very moment
when they have at last succeeded in mastering
the details, and when they were beginning
to be really useful to the country. Others do
not think it worth while to put themselves to
so much trouble, knowing full well that as
soon as the administration to which they owe
their appointment goes out of office they will
have to vacate tneir consulship The result is
that there is no inducement and no encour
agement to do anything else but one's bare
duty in the most perfunctory mannerâ iv fact,
as little as one possibly can. American con
sulships indeed are looked upon by their
holders to a great extent as a mere means of
passing a few years abroad at the expense of
the Government, and in the enjoyment of
what they believe to be an official position
with social opportunities. It is only when
they reach the other side that they find
out to their dismay and disgust that the status
of a Consul is not that of an Embassador, of a
secretary of legation, or even an attache, and
that most people in the Old World are dis
posed to view a Consul much in the same
manner as Lord Palmerston, that is, ss "no
gentleman." Ex-atiache.
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS AND HIS
CLO HBS.
Washington Post.
. Mr. James Hamilton Lewis, the new member
from Washington, was out in a new spring
suit yesterdayâ a creation of lovely brown,
with a Prince Albert coat that reached to his
heels, with , trousers that had thb latast bell
bottoms, and with spats and other accessories
to match. Shiny, beaver and , yellow gloves
and a nobby cane completed the new mem
ber's costume. .; "
But there is to be no mistake made about
Unas Hamilton Uwia, la (be language. o(
a Western man, he would assay 95 per cent
fine. Thatmpans that Mr. Lewis is pretty near
the pure stuff. He wont out to the State of
Washington irom Georels, and began work as
a. stevedore for 75 cents a day. He studied
law at night, and within two years after he
had graduated he came to the tailed States
Supreme Court and pocketed a $10,000 fee.
He was elected to Congress hands -down, for
there is no one more popular in hi- State, and
if he dresses very much like a fashion plate,
it is because, as he himself says, he has the
right to wear the very best clothes that he
can buy. _______

."""â  If a text were required upon which to bare a
'â  review of Mr.'. Gertrude Atherton's latest work.
â¢â¢Patience tparbawk and Her Times," it might
be found in the opening chapter of the Second
' Book of Samuel: "How Â»re the mighty fallen."
Three times is this sentence repeated in the
Scriptures in as many verses, as if to give
- emphasis to the sentiment, and in like manner
'â¢ might it here be thrice repeated as a Califor
â¢ nian expression of disapproval at the turn
which its native' daughter's genius has most
unexpectedly taken.
Lei it be said, in beginning, that all resi
\ dents of this State possess the highest sense
of admiration for the work done by Mrs. Ath
erton in her earlier efforts. A bit of fiction to
equal "The l'earls ol Loreto" has never been
written. It was an ideal of what a short
story should be. Its dramatic quality made
manifest in every line, its brilliant and accu
rate local coloring, its admirably sustained in
terest from the first page to tne last, its well
circumstanced situations, all combined to ex
cite the enthusiasm of lovers of good litera
ture. Can a more thrilling situation be
conceived than that described in "The Pearls
of Loreto" where De la Vega, for love of a
pretty face, enters the sanctuary to rob its
shrine of a priceless string of pearls and is
discovered in the act by its priestly guardian?
We can almost hear the hoarse cry as uttered
by the violator of his faith, can see the
con-lei head, with thin lips drawn over yellow
teetb, furious eye* burning deep in withered sock
et*, projected on its long neck from the Virgin's ,
right, and confronted him.
â¢'Thief !" hissed the priest. "Dog! Thou would st
rob the church? Accursed '. accursed '."
There was cot one moment, for hesitation, one
nliernatlve. Before the priest could complete
bis maledictions De la Vega's k' He had flashed
through the lire of the cross. The priest leaped
from his feet, then rolled over and down, and re
bounded from the railing of the sanctuary.
And immediately following there is the
scene where Yeabel, the star of Monterey,
having been informed of her lover's sacrifice
of Ms soul to gratify her whim, re
nounces her faith in like manner. That
night she entrances the Monterenos by her
dancing of El Son, appareled gorgeously
and displaying her ill-gotten jewels. In the
whirl of the feast enters a friar, who announces
the assassination of his superior. De la Vega
and Y.-abÂ»l stand accused. The assembled
: caballeros have their hands upon their swords,
but are restrained by General Castro, who
urges the laws of hospitality.
â¢â¢Never mind:" cried the friar, "l'ou cannot
protect him from that. Listen!"
' (' Had the bay risen about the custom-home?
I "What is that?" demanded Castro tharply.
"The poor of Monterey, /"hose, who love their
c-rtus better than ih) aristocrats love their caste.
: .They know"' *" rr -'-' â¢â¢ â -r\--y, â 
./.be la Veca caught Tsabel In his arm* and
dashed across the room and corrld or. His knife
cut a long rift in the canvas, and in a moment
â they stood upon the rocks. The shrieking crowd
Wore on the other side of the custom-house.
â¢' "'-Marcos 1 " h â  called to his boatman.
!'"'.. No. answer came but the waves tugging at the
. rock's not two feet below them, lie could Bee
â nothing. The fag was thick as night.
â  -..â¢"He Is not here, Ysabel. We must swim. Any
â " thing but to be torn to pieces by these wildcats.
Art thou afraid?"
"No" she said.
'-'-. He folded her closely with one arm and felt with
â his foot for the edge of th* rocks. A wild roar
came from behind. A Cozen pistol shots were
tired Into the air. De la Vesa reeled suddenly.
'â¢I am shot. Ysabel," be said, h s Knees bending.
"Not in this world, my love!"
. She wound her arms about him, and dragging
him to the brow of the rocks hurled herself out
ward, carrying him with her. The waves toised
them on high, flung them against the roc<s and
ground them there, playin? with them like a lion I
With' its victim, then burled them.
Then in the Dooms woman we recognized a
master-hand in the art of descriptive writing,
good specimens of which are to be found in
many of Its chapters. Oh, the pity of it that
so talented and versatile a writer should Lave
fallen victim to the prevailing cry for sensa
tionalismâa cry emanating from the gutter
and fostered in newspapers of the new-jour
nalistic kind. To appreciate the depth of the
fall it is necessary to consider Mrs. Atherton's
talent as manifested in her first books in Us
relation to American literature.
"In her short stories she has shown that she is
thoroughly posted regarding early Calilornian
traditions, legends and superstitions. She has
written of these in a manner most attractive.
â¢ She has described to us old Monterey, with its
missions, its wonderful cypresses, its bay and
its adobe houses. Around these and up->n this
stage she has assembled figures, puppets in her
hands, yet full of that breath of Hie so essen
tial to a well-written narrative. She has had
/at her beck all the elements which go to make
i. California absolutely the most fertile field for
\ novelist: Till she broke the ground, and I
even till to-day, there has no novelist arisen
capable of properly treating so vast a subject.
Many of the initiated even promised that it
â¢would be Gertrude Atherton who would write
the Great American Novel which has not yet
(ten the light of day.
And in reference to this last proposition,
viewing tho ground upon which she had
to work and her adaptability for its culti
vation, Californiaus might think so, too.
The land of the Doha and the Caballero,
of the Vallejos, the Castros, the Alvarados
and the Arguellos would surely appear to
possess as many possibilities as Kufus
Choate's New England to produce the Great
American Novel or series of novels. In
view of these facts, undoubted and undis
puted, what has Mrs. Atherton done of a re
markable character since tho publication of
her 6hort stories? Nothing, except &ell her
birthrightâ the 'field of California romantic
fictionâ for the mess of pottage offered Iby the
devotee of the erotic novel and of sensational
journalism. As a result, we are given "Pc
tience Sparhawk and Her Times," clever in
its way, caustic, epigrammatic, superficially
attractive, and treating of that type of New
York woman described as "a marble statue
with a snub nosj," who is "frisky" and
"larky," and who. in default of a more sub
stantial wager, "bets her hopes of a tiara."
How are the mighty fallen!
Mrs. Atherton dedicates her book to Paul
BourEPt, "who alone of all foreigners has de
tected in its full significance that the motive
power, the cohering force, the ultimate reli
gion of that strange composite known as 'The
American,' is Individual Will." If, however,
Mrs. Atherton. intends to translate '.'lndivid
ual Will" Into "intense self-reliance", she fs
Vuost emphatically wrong in thus singling
out Sourget as the ; only : man who has
iÂ»oted this characteristic of the people of
these United Stales. Hence why should poor
*'Â»oureet be thus distinguished? Nevertheless,
â¢Vatience Sparhawk" - begins well. Once
agsalnwe are transported to the cypress groves
ol Monterey. We ore made to inhale the odor !
of the pines, to hear the roar of the surf. : But
there the resemblance to Gertrude Atherton's
earlier stories stops. ..;.'.
No more do gayly,' attired caballeros wait
upon handsome women in lace mantillas,
Â£o more are pictured the gorgeously attired
and suave-mannered vnqnero, the prosperous
ranchero, the hospitable donaud his wife. Ger
trude Atherton has abandoned the time when
"the golden skeleton within the sleeping body
of California had not been laid bare," and in
lieu thereof has taken up the life of a curious
j anomaly in the shape of a 15-year-old girl.
' who reads Gibbon, Macaulay. Boccaccio and
Byron and spenks like a diminutive edition of
a Missouri backwoodsman.
As a specimen of character portrayal Pa
tience Sparhawk is n failure because of her in
stability and unreality. We cannot imagine
this child of nature reared by a drunken
mother amid the pastoral surroundings of
modern Monterey, associating daily with
girls of her own age in the local high school,
seeing nothing of the life in a great city, be
traying knowledge of good and evil whtch
could be expected only in an ancient dow
ager. Patience, as exhibited to us by her
chronicler, is a young lady of few likes and
most pronounced antipathies. Thus, when
she is informed by her schoolmates that her
mother has been seen under the influence of
liquor and that "she regularly turned the
town upside down," th!s affectionate young
Californlan, with a spirit possibly incarnated
by the Castros and Alvarados of a former gen
eration, goes home to her parent and thus
gives her views:
"I hate you! I hate youl It doesn't do any
good to tell you so, but it does me good to say
it."
Verily, a case of Elemental Hate, a young
Cain!
A Mr. Foord, who has taken much interest
in Patience, is desirous of sending her to a
sister of his, resident near New York. The
mother, however, raises the objection tnatshe
is under age. The objection is overruled by a
Drovidential fire, which consumes the lady
while she is in v state of inebriation, and Pa
tience goes Enst. This incident ends Book
I of "Patience Sparhawk and Her Times," and
with it all that portion of the story relating
to California.
The nove 1 under review is a long oneâ by far
the longest ever written by Mrs. Atherton. In
| so far as it relates to California, its scenery, its
women ana its characters, the work cannot be
called a success. All who know and love Mon
i terey, that most picturesque portion of our
i State, will note the anachronisms in the
book, the inaccuracies of her description
of Carmel Valley and Bay. Far better
would it have been for Mrs. Atherton's repu
tation as a writer had she amplified one of her
shorter tales into a goodly sized novel, bring
ing to bear upon it all the wealth of her re
search, her power of description and her
knowledge of the early history of California.
But she has neglected the opportunity. In ihe
latter chapters of "Patience Sparhawk and
Her Times" we are introduced to the mysteries
of the boudoir of the New York society woman.
Her most Intimate thoughts and lingerie are ',
shown to the light of day in a manner crude
and unrefined. Her intrigues and scandals,
her vanities and her vices are held up to re
proach in a way suggestive of nothing higher
than 20 cents per inch in newspapers of the
N. J. So has California lost her first novelist
and most promising romantic historian, and in
this wise have her romance and her history
been forsaken for the base and the erotic.
How are the mighty fallen !
Emanvel Elzas.
BRET HARTE.
No one who knows Mr. Harte, and knew the
California of his day, wonders that he left it
as he did, says Charles Warren Stoddard in a
recent issue of the Atlantic Monthly. Eastern
editors were crying for his work. Cities vied
with one another in the offer of tempting bait.
When he turned his back on San Francisco
ar.d started for Boston, he began c. tour that
the greatest author of any age might
have been proud of. It was a veritable ova
tion that swelled from sea to sea ; the classic
sheep was sacrificed all along the route. I
have often thought that if Bret Hartc had met
with a latal accident during that transconti
nental Journey the world would have declared
with one voice that the greatest genius of his
time was lost to it. His experience In New
England weighs little in the balance
with his experience in California; bis
experience abroad even less. It was
California, and early California â let
me say picturesque California â that first
appealed to him, and through him to all the
civilized nations in their several tongues. Ol
American authors Brot Harte and Mark Twain
have traveled farthest and are likely to tarry
longest. Whom would you substitute for
these? Whom could you? In print each is as
American as America, though the former has
not been with us for a score of years and msy
never a_-Â» in revisit his native land. When he
left California in 1871 he left it betimes; he took
with him about all that was worth taking,
and the California he once knew, and surely
must have loved, lives forever in his pages.
It no longer exists in fact; but for him, in an
other generation it wouid nave been for?ot
ten. Because he has penetration such as few
possess, and exceptional fancy, imagination
i and literary art, he has been thought untrue
! to nature; those wnom he has pictured would
have no difficulty in recogni^ng themselves
could they but see the types he has made his
own. It has been said, too, that he repeats
himself. He does; so does spring and so does
summer â each is but another spring, an
other bummer; but they are never twice
alike, nor would we have them other
than they ere. Any one can vouch
for Bret Harte's truth to nature
who knew San Francisco in the fifties, and is
familiar with his civic and character sketches ;
what is true of one page is true of all. It is
the point of view in every ca^e ttUU deter
j mines to whom the page or tie picture shall
I appeal, and whether farorably or unfavorably.
The comprehensive edition of his works, pre
i pared while he is yet alive and active, attests
the worid-wlde interest in his work and fore
shadows its permanence. â From Current

A PRIZE STORY.
â¢THE INCENDIARY." By W. F. i,eahy. Chi
cago and Mew York : Rand, McNally & Co.
Out o! 81G competitors this story was
awarded the fourth prize in the Chicago
Record's "$30,000 to authors' competition."
The reader is given ample opportuuity to find
out if he has any latent powers about him that
might by exercise develop him into a de
tective. There are mnny clews suggested as
to the orlpin of a mysteriously started fire
which resulted In great loss of property and
of life, which the reader can try to unravel,
weighing all the evidence pro and con, till he
forms a theory of who the incendiary was. its
merit as a story of mystery has been certified
by competent literary judgment in the receipt
of the price over the efforts of many other
authors. Aside from the interest in the
mystery there is an attractive character in
the person of McCausland, the detective, who
hail nothing in nil exterior that suggested the
sleuthâ he was a rollicking comjmnlon, suave
of voice and genial of manner; but "in the
pursuit of crime he was a believer in total ae
pravity, or rather, to Lc just, he knew the po
tential evil which is harbored in every human
heart."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 18, 1897.
Gertrude Franklin Atherton, whose latest work is noticed on this page, was born in San Francisco. She attended
Clark's Institute, and, after graduation, a school in Lexington, Ky. Her first story, "Randolph of the Redwoods," was
published anonymously in the Argonaut, and its satire caused much stir among members of the local "400.'' Mrs. Ather
ton's first novel caught the public eye, and sharpened the axes of the critics. â From a photograph by Thors.
SEEKING AN IDEAL.
'THE WELL-BELOVKD"â Ry Tbornan Hardy.
New York: Harper <fc Brothers. For sale by A.
M-, Robertson, Post streel. City. Price $1 W.
This sketch oi a temperament is cleverly
done, and throws a poetic glamour over a char
acter frequently met in a more or less devel
oped form. Such a one seems merely fickle to
the ordinary observer, and too trifling to be
worthy of much thought. Tne genius of
Thomas Hardy has, however, placed the
character mentioned in quite a new and more
favorable light. He makes us sec in the man
whose love wanders with such wonderful fa
cility from woman to woman an artistic soul,
simply obeying the imperative behest of his
peculiar organization to engage in pursuit of
an impossible ideal. His futile seccing is a
strange mixture of pleasure and pain to this
lover, and he is no more to be blamed for his
obedience to the subtle suggestions given to
him from the spiritual laws of his being than
would a man for possessing brown eyes or
blue, and his seeming inconstancy is shown to
be in such a nature the most consistent con
stancy.
It is a puzzle to guess how far the author of
"Life's Little Ironies" meant to be ironic in
tbis narrative of a fculptor who pursued with
such eager desire the intangible spirit of his
weli-be loved as it mysteriously flitted from
the person of one fair woman to another. It
seems to be a subject to which he devoted his
talents half in suppressed laughter and half in
a mood of the most serious and subtle analysis
of character.
The artistic Inconstant herein portrayed,
who seems in some ways entirely too day
dresmy for tha uses of this world, would be
called a fantast by some, says Thomas Hardy.
Others will see him oalv as one who gave ob
jective continuity and a name to a delicate
dream which in a vaguer form is more or less
common to all men, and is by no means new to
the Platonic philosophers.
The sculptor escaped a good deal of self
reproach by making it clear to his mind that
he faithfully loved the "masquerading crea
ture wherever he found her, whether with
blue eyes, black eyes or brown. Il was simply
that she who always attracted him and lead
him whither she would as by a silken thread
had not remained the occupant of the tame
fleshly tabernacle in her career."

A REINCARNATION ROMANCE.
ZISKA â By Marie CorÂ»lll. New York; Stone *
Kimball. For sale In liin City by A. M. Robert
son, t'os: street. I'r.i â¢â¢ f 1 50.
The "Problem of a Wicked Soul" is the sub
title of tbis book, in which the author of "The
| Sorrows of Satan" and "The Romance of Two
j Worlds" follows her bent for writing some
what flightily of the mysterious. This might
have been expected from previous experience
of her productions. The story is based on the
theory held by theosophists and Buddhists
that the soul is successively recloihed in the
flesh of many different bodies in the long
course of its development Most westerns can
not think thus, but it cannot tÂ»- stid that such
a theory of retribution and spiritual training
is unacceptable to Aryan minds, for we have
many thought'ul and studious people among
us to whom Karma and rein -arnniion is a
creed as firmly held as by the great scholars oi
the East.
Most people would rather read a story more
concrete and credible than this wild flight of
CorMli's imagination, but tastes differ, and
this writerof mysteries has already abundant y
proved that her style is popular, and she is
making no reckless experiment in a commer
cial sense, no matter how much she may ot
fend the canons of sober literary taste. Some
of her flights of attempted eloquence are as
giddily heady as if a feverish brain were the
motor of the pen.
Ziska Is a Russian princess of such over
whelmingly magnetic beauty that even a
Corelli requires ample space to picture her.
She is a reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian
and is met in Cairo by Gervase, a famous
French artist and an atheist, who is a reincar
nation of an ancient Egyptian warrior and
conqueror, Araxes. His desire for possession
of Ziski, passionate and unholy, and its fear
ful spiritual punishment is the motif of the
story, and the reasouing by which we are ex
pected to accept its extravagant improbabil
ity can be summed up most tersely in that
often quoted sentence of Hamlet's, "There are
more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
than ure dreamt of in your philosophy."
Inasmuch as reincarnation is an interesting
subject of speculation as to the past and future
of our souls, the general design of the story
may be said to be good, but the overwrought
eloquence of its execution culls for same con
demnatory criticism. More sobriety of ex
pression would have given more beauty, and
the bathing of the talented author's temples
in cold water would have made her spirit
calmer to interpret suggestions from Pallas.
Very many sentences in the book sound like
delirious ravings.
Marie Corelli has in "Ziska" invented a
phrase to define the persistent wickedness of
some humans, which deserves to be perpetu
ated. She puts it into the mouth of a very
righteous and very learned doctor of philoso
phy, and it possesses the ring of scientific ac
curacy. It chimes with the theory of endless
spiritual evolution through countless rein
carnations, and she calls it 'â Torpidity of the
psychic germ."

FROM THE FRENCH.
MME. CHRYSANTHKXtR-By Pierre Lot.
London and New York. George Rout etU'e &
Sons. For sale in this City by A. M. Robertson,
Pose street. Price 91 25. -
Artistic in a very quaint , and dainty way is
this reprint of a work by the popular French
author. The multitude of design* by Rossi
and Meyerbach are so exquisite as to make
the book worth having were there naught else
in it to add to its charm. An idea of the style
of the book can be quickly grasped from these
words in Loti's dedication of it to La Duchesse
de Richelieu: "Kindly welcome it in the
same spirit that yon would receive some quaint
bit of pottery, some grotesquely carved ivory
idol, or some preposterous trifle brought back
for you from this singular fatherland of all
preposterousness."
The dedication represents the author as
telling an incident out of . his own life. He
spent a summer in Japan, and for amusement
married a Japanese girl for the season only.
It was a legal . union in the Mikado's realm.
Here such an arrangement would ' be : consid
ered vile, for it could bi dissolved at pleasure,
and the girl was bought for $13 per month.
The tale is told with such an air of the affair
being a harmless holiday frolic as is almost too
French for our standards of the correct way to
narrate an immorality. But to French taste
it seems that to be artistic is sufficient to
silence puritanic criticism; and here our con
vention seems to allow a translation from the t
French a wider latitude (provided the author
has been duly crowned as one of the exception
ally clever) than is granted to our own writers.
All the facts of this playing at marriage with
tiny Mme. Chrysanthemum for the summer
could be told by an American , author, but
never with so assured an innocence of man
ner. But in keeping with most Japanese
things it is too quaintly absurd to be taken
seriously. ___â¢Â«

A simple story of a fine young Irish boy and
his struggle against the ills that resulted from
the bur sinister of his birth. He is in love
with an Irish girl named Dulcie, who is as
sweet as her name. His father was a patri
cian and his mother a peasant. The father
repented late of the wrong he had done to
Moywa, the mother, and wished to make
amends to the illegitimate son, but the law of
the land forbade the passing of the estates to
one born out of wedlock. The happy denoue
ment is the aiscovery of Moywa, who was sup
posed to be dead, and the old lord marries her
in order to legitimate his son. Then said this
Irish lover to his love: "Ye loved me, Dulcie,
when I was the poor squireen. Ye won't love
me the less now that I'm to be the Lord Kil
patrick?" "Not less," said Dulcie, "nor more.
Sure," she added, with the most musical of
brogues, " 'twould be impossible."

the author now puts forward a work which
will command universal attention. The new
book, which will be published in a few weeks
by D. Aopleton & Co., will be liirjer and more
comprehensive than "Looking Backward."
The scene is the sameâ that is to say, the world
of the twentieth centuryâ and the same char
acters reappear. But while tne new book tel'.s
no much that is fresh about the institution* of
the world of to-morrow, its especial purpose,
8 .-iÂ«;-- agt:i3ne<t from that of "Looking Buck
ward," is to account for those institutions by
explaining not only their righteousness and
reason, but likewise the course of historical
evolution by which they were born out of tha
very different order of things existing tc-aay.
In this part of his work the author has much
to sey 01 the meaning of the events of our own
times, which he links with the future by pre
dictions of changes now close upon us. The
title, "Equality," Is well chosen, in viÂ«w ot
the general theme.

as one of the brightest of the year.
Most of them were sure the little long
eared rabbits would come while they
slept and leave pretty briehi -colored eggs !
for them in a'l sorts of odd hiding places. I
But poor little Willie O'Brien didn't talk I
much about it. He was 5 years old, and
never had had an Ertster egg. lie could j
not understand at all whjr the bunnies!
slighted him. The boys said it was cau-e j
he was poor and wore such old clothes, j
"H'm, rabbits don't like poor folks," cried
one boy whose father Was rich.
Willies papa bad been dead for three
yeart, and his mother went out washing
for a living, so the poor little boy was left
alone a great deal.
One night when his mamma came home
very tried and hungry Willie asked Her
what she thought about it.
The poor woman was hurrying to got
their supper an 1 did not mean to be bar*h
when she said: "Oh, don't be botherin'
me now about yer Easter eg^s. They're
not for the likes of ye, I tell ye." A great i
lump gathered in the little fellow's throat
and his eyes filled with tears.
"Then it must be true." he said, "rab
bits don't like poor folks."
The child went to sle*p very sad, but he
dreamed a sweet, sweet dream about a nest
in the grass filled with red, b!uÂ«, yellow
and purple eggs. Beside the nest sat a
&ure white rabbit, and while he was
I watching it, strange to say, it opened its
mouth and in tones a* sweet an the music
of a little silver bell said, '"Willie, dear,
these ejrgs are all for you, for you !" Then
it disappeared.
i He felt like crying when, in the morn
ng , he found he ha I only bern dreaniinc,
but the memory of it gave htm sweet faith
t bat in spite of his mother's discouraging
words the rabbits would surely not forget
him this year.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 18, 1897.
So be told his little chum, Bobbie Gray
of bow ho had dreamed such a lovely
dream and how he felt sure that on Easter
morning it would come true.
When Bobbie went home he told his
sister Netue, who was older than he, how
he did hope that Willie nucht have some
oretty egjÂ»s. He also told her about the
little boy's dream and hi 3 belief that it
would come true.
His sister promised to try to think up
some plan whereby Willie might not be
disappointed.
At last she said, "Bobbie, are you will
in jr to give up eating your epg lor break
fast every morning until Easter? If you
do, I shall also. Let me see â four days
âthat would make eight eÂ«(?s. Tlien
we'll save our nickels, too, to buy four
more; so we'll have a whole dozen, and
you xnow we'll need to spend something
for dyes with which to color tiiera."
''Oh, you're a. brick, sister!" shouted
Bobbie, throwing his hat into the air,
"and we'll keep it a secret, and Wiilie 'ill
think the rabb.ts did it. after all.' 1
Time passed. The eg.'S were laid away
safely every day by the children with an
air of great mystery and importance, and
"no questions answered" was the way
they replied to all inquiries about their
sudden dislike to ezgs for breakfas:. The
little iron bank in Bobbie's room held zx
bright nickels when the day before Easter
arrived.
Bobbie and Nettie were very busy that
day, and In the evening a dozen beauti
fully colored eggs lay in a pretty little
basfcet ready to be carried over to Mrs.
O'Brien's the next morning. There was
something else in the basket, too. When
I Nettie and Bobbie were leaving the store
j after buyine the dyes Mr. Brown, the pro
prietor, had called Bobbie back to give
him a beautiful white sugar labbit, with
little pieces of pink sugar for eyes. Bob
bio was delighted, for he had never be/ore
owned one, but after much debating with
himself he had finally placed it in Wil
lies basket.
They had had great fun coloring the
eggs, and Bobbie's hands and face and
j Nettle's apron were very funny looking
i all daubed and streaked witn yellow and
blur.
Willie had spent a very lonely Satur
: day. All the other boys and girls were so
much occupied talking over the good
"to-morrow" coming and practicing for
their Sunday-school exercises, that they
had no time to think of him.
Poor little. fellow! He sat on the back
door step munching his dry bread and
looking up at the lovely blue sky, over
which -flocks of soft, woolly sheep were
rolling and tumbling along, his eyes as
blue as the skies, and his hair shining like
a mass of spun, gold in the bright sun
shine. ' - ". " â 
A'l at once he ran down into the yard
and busied, himself in 'making a great,
lovely nest of the long green grass which
covered the ground, talking to himself all
the while.
"I'll make it so pretty and so safe and
so com fie that they'll know how I do
love them, and they'll leave me some
red eggs and some blue ones and some
yellow ones." Then when all was finished
be dropped on his knees and lisped,
"Please, God, don't let the bunnies forget
Willie this time."
Early the next morning two little figures
slipped out from Mr. Nelson's frontdoor
before any one else was stirring. Between
them was the basket of eggs. Down the
lane and around the corner across to the
place where Willie lived they went.
There wai a hole in the fence through
which they crept. Then tney caught
sight of the nest.
"Just the thing," whispered Nettie.
"Willie made it on purpose, I'm sure."
The e_'gs were soon nicely fixed In the
nest and the children hurried away, so
! frightened that Willis might catch a
glimpse of them.
About an hour afterward, as they were
eating their breakfast, they heard Willies
voice outvie, calling:
"Oh, Robbie 1 come, see! They did!
They dial I knew they would! "
Bobbie and Nettie felt very glad when
they went out and saw the little fellow's
joy as he stood with his pretty eggs in his
apron, whilo the sugar rabbit vas held
lovingly up 10 one cheek.
Then out came their father and mother,
and when they uttered words of praise to
their children Bobbie. said it was the very
happiest Easter morning ho had ever
spent.

STAGE
It may be the big royalties, it may be a j
widespread desire for fame, or it may be
a spring epidemicâ the people who are
always lecturing about so:ioloey and fin
de-siecle tendencies ought to knowâ ali
that I am concerned in stating is that a
mania *eems lately to have possessed
young and old, nigh and law, rich and
poor, to write play?. The number of plays
produced in San Francisco alone would
Bupply the world with dramatic novelties,
and fre.-ti aspirants for playwright's laurels
ore always bobbing up serenely, generally
among people one would least suspect
of any desire to follow in William Shake
speare's footsteps.
No one in the dramatic profession is
cleverer or more observing than Miss
Georgia Cayvan, and to her I apply for
information on ihe play-writing epidemic.
Mi.-s Cayvan'i prompt reply is that she
divides the world inio two classes â people
wno write plays and peopie who do not,
and on the whole sue thinks the former
class predominates.
"If any one would dare to tell the truth
to dramatists it wo^ld do so much good,"
she says with a smile that would soften
the bitterest truth and nmke it seem al
most pleasant flattery. "The mass of
knowledge that is not possessed by j
dramatists is vast, very va;-t, but it would |
be no use to presume to point out the truth I
to playwrights; they would become in- j
dignant at once. 1 continually receive
plnys that bear all the earmarcs of having
been the round of many managers, and I
am told what flattering remarks each
has made, but evidently no one has
pointed out the faults. If this play has
escaped ali tbe Dig managers, can it be any
use to me? I wonder; but I read it, if it is
typewritten, for gooJ plays are very diffi
cult to procure, and one never dares to
turn anything away. 1 carry manuscript
about with me and glance at it in odd
moments, but I have never had anything
good from an unknown dramatist yet, or
I should certainly have produced it. I
mention as a curious fact, not as an in
stance oi my perspicuity, that none cf ihe
plays I have passed by have ever been
afterward produced with any success."
Miss Cayvan Ukes to read a play in cold
type, and has a horror of letting a dram
atist read his work to her. "Playwrights
continually expect approbation," she says.
"I once let Robert Buchanan read one of
his works to me, and he went through it
with an air of, 'If you don't admire this,
you must be a born idiot. 1 "
"Do you think the dramatist of the fu
ture is likely to begin life as an actor?"
I a*k. "The dramatist, ot the future is
more likely to De a woman than a man, 1 '
replies Miss Cayvan. "Piay- writing is
falling so rapidly into the hands of
women. Just at present the piofession is
in a state of transition. The strong popu
lar tendency toward the vaudeville siage
makes me think that perhaps the great
p. ay of the future will comoine the vaude
ville and the spectacular with tiie dra- i
matic; out there, again, you can never I
teH, fasiiion changes so rapidly. It is â¢
getting more and mora difficult to find
the universal drama â plays of the class of
'Caruille' and 'The Two Orphans' â that
appeal to people of all classes and nation
alities. The drama seems to be growing
more sectional, ana French plays are more
and more difficult to translate and adapt, so J
America must look to Americans for its
plays."
Q-iite recently Miss Cayvan was in
1-urope for ten months, and practically
saw all the new plays, but she did not
admire any of them enouga to want to
purchase. Her ambition is to get a good
American play. "There are wonderful
periods for costume drama in American
history," she says reflectively. "The
period antedating the Revolution, for in
stance, when Washington was looked on
as a disturber of the peace and when i
fathers were beginning to turn against
sons and sons against fathers. The old
Virginia life holds great dramatic possi
bilities, but it has been scarcely touched."
"And all your labors in reading voluntary
contributions have been hopeless? ' I ask.
"Quite hopeless," replies Mias Cayvan,
resignedly. "Someiimes there are grains
of merit in works submitted to me by un
known authors, and I think 'this can be
fixed,' but we soon find that an attempt to
revamp the thing produces a hopeless
muddle, and we have to give up in despair,
but I do not pass anything over, for who
knows when a pearl may be found
among the chaff? and good pla3 r s are
hard, very hard, to get."
It is not only stars like IC!si Cayvaa who
receive plays by the bushel. Local stock
companies and managers of theaters are
deluged with them, and their cry is tho
same as Miss Cayvan's, "Nothing worth
producing." "Plays!" says genial Ai
Morgenstern of the Baldwin. "If you
had been half an hour earlier I could have
shown you a man with a blood-anl-tbun
der drama â 'Orotanski, the Dynamiter.'
He obligingly said that we might have it
for 10 per cent royalty, and it would not
cost us more than $500 to paint the scen
ery. People come here all the time with
thefr plays, although we never i_roduce
anything, but they imagine we have a
pull with the traveling companies." And
then I am told a whimsical experience
that befell Otis Skinner the other day. He
received a play from 6an Diego with a
name known to fame on (he title-page.
"I am Colonel Robert Shakespeare." wrote
the San Diego playwricht, "a collateral
descendant of William Shakespeare, and
I Kball expect extra payment on account
of my name." From all accounts Robert
has not inherited the transcendent genius
of William for play- writing.
I find Manager .Be.'afco sitting in his
otlioe at tue Alcazar, which is too small to
swing a kitten in, much less the proverbial
cat. He makes his headquarters in the
smallest hole and corner available, witn j
the fell design of keeping out more than
one amateur dramatist at a time. "Do
you receive many manuscript play? ?" I ask
from the doorway, wondering whether
my crowding in the office will necessitate
Arthur Lotto, the businesÃ manager, hav
ing to wriggle out. Belasco starts so vio
lently that he would fall out of his revolv
ng chair if there were any other space to
receive him, but ne is between Scylia and
Charybdis, or between the desk and the
wall, which is the same thing, (or neither
affords any chance of escape. 'You have
broughtâ that is, you have written "
Belaeco murmurs, eying me very much
as a terrified mouse would eye a cat. I
assure him that I have neither brought
nor written; I am seeking information
about amateur playwrights. "You'll ex
cuÂ°o me," he replies, laughing, with an
air of immense relief, and mopping the
i beads of perspiration from his l>ro\v. "I
1 have not been weil for the last few days
and a sadden shock easily upsets my
nerves."
"Do playwrights corns in such great num
bers?" 1 ask. "Do they ?" echoes Arthur
Lotto, pulling down a pile of manuscripts
from the pigeonholes in the desk. "Do
they? Look here, and here, and here â
j and I have bushels more at home." He
spreads the papers out and makes hay
with them in a way that ?ays plainly:
"There are plenty more where these came
from." "ilr. Lotto interviews the play
wrights. lam always called away on press
ing business when a man or woman with
a roil of manuscript looms up and asks for
the manager," say* Belasco, wi h a
wicked twinkle in his eyes. "If the plays
are typewritten I read them all," remarks
Lotto. "It is the hardest thing in the
world to get a good play, and the man
ager who refuses to look at amateur work
never knows when ho is turning away
go:d among the dross. â¦ * * We have
not found any gold so far, but we may
strike it any day. You know the story of
the piay that lay in A. M. Palmer's ?afe
for two year*. One day, when an English
drama he had just prod ucea had proven
an utter failure, Palmer took the first
manuscript that came to his hand out of
bis safe. It was 'Alabama.' "
"What are the faulis of these?" I ask,
singling out a few of the MS. that strew
the desk. "The same old faults, I sup
pose," says Lotto, wearily. "Wildly im
probable scenes, impossible situations,
people making entrances and exits aim
lessly; then the amateur dramatist will
insist on changing from a wood to the ex
terior of an inn, then to an interior and
back to the wood, all in one act. It was
very well to jump about in that erratic
way in Shakepeare's time, when the only
scenery was a board with the inscription:
'This is a wood,' or 'This is an inn,' but
modern stage-setting will not stand it.
Now here's a piece," and he singles out a
bulky MS. "A young lady brought it
yesterday morning, and asked if shÂ« might
read her play â it would not take many
minutes. Tnere are seventy-four speak
ing characters in the first act, and after
she had read steadily for an hour and a
half, she grew quite confused and asked
for a class of water. We did not want a
fainting lady on our hands, so we prom
ised to read the play ourselves."
"This play must ba from a woman, 1
say," selecting a manuscript jauntily tied
with blue and yellow ribbon and trimmed
with little bows. "Not at a;J ; an cfficsr
at the Presidio sent it," says Mr. Lotto,
laughing. "That play is a war drama â a
cavalry war drama, and the officer (you
see his name on the title-page) orna
mented it with blue and yellow because
they are the cavalry colors." "Shal yoa
act the war drama?" I ask, wondering
why editors insist that only women tie up
their manuscript with ribbon. "It is
wildly, weirdly impossible." replies the
business mannger dec:dedly. "A glance
at the title-page shows how unskilled a
playwright the author must be. The
drama is in four acts, and there are three
characters. Three people could not pos
sibly sustain the interest through four
acts."
"And this?" I ask, selecting a neat-look
ing manuscript which somehow cives the
impression that ihe man who wrote it
is used to dabbling in literature. "It is
from a clergyman at San Jose," says
Lotto. A clergyman ! bless me! what a
hold the drama must have on the public
mind for a minister of the gospel to give
up his time to writing a play and sending
it in all seriousness to a theatrical mana
ger, la the hope that t will be produced.
I am asked not to divulge the clergy
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 18, 1897.
man's name, some of his flock may object j
to play-acting, but if it is sinful to write'
a good play the San Jose clergyman's
flock may tet thoir minds at rest. His
work is about as fitted for acting purposes
as the city directory. Probably ho has
never been Inside a theater and knows
even less about stagecraft than the young
lady who had seventy-four speaking char
acters in her first act. In one respect the
San Jo-e clergyman is like the cobbler
who sticks to bis last â his play is n bibli
cal drama. Good, unsophisticated soul!
bnncy sitting in his study, surrounded by
Baxter's "Saints' Rest," "BuMer's Anal
ogy" and other light and airy theological
worts and writing a biolical drama for
the use of a fin de siecle company. Ala?!
that we should have become so shallow
and flippant, and knowing that even
Sarah Bernhart makes a colossal failure
when she tries to act bibical drama. If |
we want the Bible acted with meet and
due reverenco we have to go to the sim
ple, unworldly peasants of Gberam
tnergau.
All the aspirants for dramatic honors
are not so honest as the girl with seronty
fonr characters and the clergyman who
dramatized a Bible story. "A great many
people bring us old plays with other
titles and the names of the characters
changed," says Belasco, "and we receive
numbers of p!ays which are little more
than typewritten transcriptions of fa
miliar dime novels. College students
seem to spend a great part of their time
in writing plays, to judge from the num
ber ol letters we receive from tho universi
ties, and fond parents are continually
bringing their children's work." "And
is everything utterly, hopelessly bad?" I
ask, thinking regretfully of the wasted
time aad energy. "Not at all," says
Lotto, cheerfully; "some of these people
show promise, but their work is crude and
displays no knowledge of stagecraft. To
make it lit for production it would have
to be entirely rewritten by a practical
playwright. If some of these people
could get an expert to collaborate with
them inoy might be really successful."
And then I go my way, wondering how
it is that no provision is made for guiding
the playwright into the straight and nar
row pat â  of experience that leads to suc
cess. This country is full of dramatic
schools that undertake at so much a head
to manufacture wild, untamed amateurs
into finished artists. There are so many
dramatic schools and voice-builders, and
stage-gesture professors and what not
that they positively elbow one another,
but the poor amateur playwrights are left
to err and stray alone like lost sheep. No
dramatic school open its portals to them,
no experienced playwright says: "Come
to me and I will teach you." In view of
the vast number of people who are writing
plays I wonder that no "professor of
stagecraft" has put out his shingle and
started a school for aspiring dramatists,
undertaking to convert raw material into
Khakespeares ana Juolleres "while you
wait." Just think of it â over 20,030 plays
are annually submitted to managers in
this country and not a dozen successful
piays are annually produced.

BaldWirv Jheater.
Primrose and West, who bring their
minstrel organization to the Baldwin
Theater to-night, have a company com
posed of a hundred members â in fact, a
double company. The novelty of this
consists in the way the "first part" 13 |
given. It is divided into two sections, or
"two editions," as they call it. The first
"edition" is meant to show the origin of
minstrelsy and is given by a company of
genuine colored minstrels, and consists of
original "buck" dancing, singing and ac
robatic worlt. The next "edition" is
Kiven by the white company of minstrels
and is an exposition of the modern idea of
minstrelsy.
The company this season includes
George H. Primrose, William H. West.
George Wilson, Jimmy Wali, Howe and
Walters; William H. Windom, the
phenomenal alto; Charles Kent, the bary
tone; Arthur Williams, the operatic
tenor; Frank Puzlcer, the barytone;
George Robinson, the lyric tenor; Ed
Dickens, the basso profundo; John H.
Davis, second tenor. Among the new
songs to be heard are: "There's a Bully
Gone to Rest," '"hot Time in Old To^n
To-night," '-Take Back Your Gold," and
"Dariing Mabel."
Columbia Jheater.
Miss Georgia Cayvan and her company
will to-morrow night present for the
first time in this City a new comedy by
W. R. Walkes, entitled "Mary Penning
ton, Spinster." This is said to be a dainty
comedy of the same category as the Rob
ertson comedies of a generation ago, or
the Carton plays of to-day. It was origin
ally pro tuced in London, and is to be
given here exactly as when first produced
in New York, as all the original scenery,
properties and appointments are carried
with Miss Cayvau'it company for all of the
plays in her repertoire.
Mr. Waikes has made the over-edncated
woman tne object of his satire. His hero
ine. Mary Pennington, has been educated
at Girtou, a hotbed of Euxlisd female in
dependence, and has there absorbed some
very radical ideas, among them a belief
that woman is absolutely the equal of man,
a theory which she puts into operation
when she assumes the management oi her
deceased father's business, a large milling
property. She substitutes women for her
male hands and vays them men's wages,
with the unhappy result of encouraging
idleness among the men, and eventually
precipitating a strike which works the
tinancial rum of the old and honored firm
of Pennington. Mary is also opposed to
matrimony, holding that it is unworthy of
i the consideration of any woman of strong
mentality. Fulling in love herself with
her- junior partner, this theory is rather
bard to uphold. . .....
The latter ' part of the week is reserved
for the presentation of a double bill con
sisting of a new comedy by Mrs. Elizabeth
Bisland, "Goblin Castle" and a one-act
comedietta. "The Little Individual," by
Thomas ilayiies Bayley. ;7-;; ; * â

A REVOLUTIONIZING INVENTION IN HEAVY ARMY ORDNANCE
Patent papers were issued a few days I
ago for what must be conceeded to be the
most important invention made in the
field of heavy ordnance during the pres
ent decade.
The invention was conceived and worked
out in San Francisco, and the first trials â
that demonstrated its effectivenessâ were
made at the Presidio, although at the
time not more than four people knew
what was #oing on. The Call gives the
first explicit disclosure of the wonderful
discovery to the world.
Briefly, the invention is a projectile that
can be fired from an old-fashioned smooth
bore cannon with all tne force and pre
cision of the most modern rifle. The
magnitude of such an invention may not
be apparent at first thought, but it will
dawn upon you. as you proceed.
The inventor of this projectile, which
may revolutionize modern gun-building,
is Colonel W. H. Bell, U. S. A., at present
assistant commissary-general at Wash
ington. Colonel Bell was chief commis
sary of the Department of California for
two years. He was stationed in San Fran
cisco, but left here several months ago
and was succeeded by Colonel Willard.
In order to make the principle of
Colonel Bell's invention comprehensible
to the Jay mind some explanation of the
forces governing the flight of a projectile
from a cannon's mouth will be necessary.
The earliest cannon made were smooth
bores firing a round shot. If such condi
tions as a perfectly calm atmosphere and
an absolutely tight fit of a projectile
made of lead existed the flight of the
projectile would be accurate and forcible.
But such conditions never exist, and con
sequently several phenomena take place
that inventors have for years been work
ing to overcome.
In the first place the atmosphere is al
ways in circulation, more or less. In the
next place shot cannot be made of lead,
as that metal is 100 expensive. Thirdly,
the shot cannot fit tightly in the cannon
because that would cause it to burst.
Isow, what are the consequences? A
smooth-bore cannon, greased and pol
ished, is charged with the requisite
amount of powder. In front of this is a
round, iron shot, and the weapon is ready
to fire.
When the gun is "touched off ; the first
thing that takes place is the expansion of
the burning powder. As the iron shot
does not fit tight and only touches the
sides of the bore at its circumference part
of the force generated by the burning pow
der blows past it and is wasted. The
round shot being of iron is consequently
not neavy enough to offer the proper re
sistance to the force of the powder and is
blown from the cannon before me burn
ing powder has developed its full power,
whiSh means another waste.
As the shot flies tnrough the air the
atmospheric pressure is bound to be the
greatest on the side from which the wind
comes. Consequently, there is a force
piled up on that side that causes the
shot to "roll," or to be rrore clear to re
volve on an axis at right angles to the
wind force. The result of this is that the
round shot describes a curve instead of
traveling in a straight line, and ia there-
âAS EFFECTIVE AS THIS GUN WITH THE RIFLED BARREL.
jKe French ir\ Tunisia.
When, on May 12, 1881, Tunisia was
placed by the Bardo convention under
French control, this old province of Africa,
formerly one of the granaries of impe
rial Rome, had fa;len through centuries of
misrule in a quasi state of barbarism.
Many portions of this territory, once so
fertile, became desertlike and covered with
unproductive brushes. 'When the French
entered Tunis there were but four kilo
meters of road, 22ft kilometers of railroads
near the coast, three lighthouses on the
northern shore. The ports were all
choked with sand, and hardly accessible.
The cisterns were often waterless,
and irrigation very badly carod for. There
â were but twelve postoffices, mo<t unre
liable, as a matter of fact; twenty-four
schools, of which twenty were kept by re
ligious congregations. An unpaid army
was the only protection granted to native*
and settlers. Such was the chaotic state
of affairs in the regency when the protec
torate was instituted. Since that time a
wonderful progress has been accom
plished. To-day Tunisia possesses 1400
kilometers of macadamized roads, 667
kllometeis of railroads, eleven large
lighthouses, twenty-nine smaller ones
and ten luminous buoys at the har
bors' entrance?. Four large ports and
eleven less important ones are now open
to the trade. Forty-two localities are sup
plied with 20,000 cubic meters of fresh
water per diem. Sixty-four postoffices
and 156 sub-stations haye been established.
fore unreliable. From the time the round ]
iron shot is fired from the smooth-bore
until it hits somewhere it is a series of
disappointments. First, there is waste of
powder, and lastly inaccuracy.
Now, what would be the consequence of
a conical iron shot fired from a smooth
bore? This form of projectile would over
come the objection of light weight and
would also offer enough contact at the
sides of the bore to prevent the burning
powder from blowing past. Consequently,
at the instant it leaves the cannon's
mouth it would have the highest possible
initial velocity and would be pointing
directly at the place the gun was aimed.
But before the projectile had traveled
twenty-five feet there would be trouble.
The atmospheric pressure would get in its
work. Instead of causing this shot to
"roll" it would cause it to "tumble." That
is, describe a series of circles such ns a
stick would if thrown into the air from
your hand. The result of this would be to
first retard the shot by presenting its side
to the resisting atmosphere and then to
cause it to fly inaccurately on account of
each tumble starting it in a different di
rection. Taken on the whole, except at
very short range, the conical shot is no
more satisfactory in a smooth-bore than a
round shot.
All of the objections just mentioned
were overcome several years ago by the
invention of the "riflei" cannon, but at
the same time other objections were
created. However, a* the rifled cannon
developed the maximum efficiency and
accuracy with a conical shot it has long
been the accented type ot' gun.
The "rifling" of a cannon consists in
cutting a groove in the form of a spiral
along the sides of the bore. This causes
the shot in its passage from breech to
muzzle to acquire a twist, that is, a cir
cular motion around its longitudinal axis.
This twist is due to the friction of the
shot and the spiral groove and also to the

efforts of the pases from the burning
powder to blow out through the groove past
the shot. The result of tue twist of the
shot during its flight through the air is
to prevent it from tumbling and also to
prevent the air from oiling upon the wind
side and so awerve it from a straight
course.
The objections to the rifled cannon are
many. Altnougn the principal one is ex
pense, very careful manufacture is neces
sary, and the cutting of the "groove is a
difficult task, requiring the most expen
sive machinery.
The expense of such a weapon naturally
calls for means to protect it, and conse
quently the pneumatic disappearing gun
carriage came into existence, as well as
other forms of forts and bomb proofs. A
first-class modern nine-inch rifled can-
non with all equipments would cost in
the neighborhood of $250,000. A smooth
bore cannon of the same size is worth
about $6000.
Colonel Bell in his study of projectiles
worked on the theory that it was only
necessary to give the twist to the shot to
create accuracy and force. How to do it
was the only question. During the last
decade he has built many models and it
would seem that he has at last found
what he has long been seeking. His in
vention has been given one preliminary
trial and will very soon be put to exten
sive tests by the Government.
The constriction of Colonel Bell's pro
ectile is so simple that it can cost very
little more than those now in use. No
additional apparatus for loading it is re
quired, nor will it necessitate any special
study on the part of the gunners. It con

any shape or dimensions as long as it con
forms to the conical principle.
The projectile is of course made of iron,
and the main body of it is cast in the
usual manner. It is exactly like the coni
cal shot now in use, except that it has a
â mall chamber at the breech.
The other portion of the shot is a plug,
that can also be cast, and which screws
into the end of the chamber at the
breech. Around the edge of this plug are
a series of grooves at an angle.
Of course the details of the manufacture
of the projectile have not yet been studied
out, but the manipulation will necessarily
be very sim pie. After the body of the shot
is cast it will be put into a machine and
have a thread cut around the upper edge
of the breech end of tue chamber. The
plug will also have a thread cut on its
outer edge so that it will easily screw into
and close the breech end of the chamber,
except the grooves, which now become a
series of holes.
Supposing such a projectile were to be
put to actual use. The shot and the plugs
would be carried, without being screwed
together, to the place where they would
be fired. When all was ready a charge of
the usual rapid-burning powder would be
put into the smooth-bore cannon. A
charge of slow-burning powder would be
put into th* chamber at the breech of the
shot and the plug screwed into place. The
shot would then be loaded into the cannon
in the usual way and the gun would be
ready for tiring.
When the gun was fired the rapid-burn
ing powder would be consumed first, and
would ignite the slow-burning powder
through the holes on the edge of the plug.
The weight of the shot would offer the
necessary resistance, and the slow-burning
powder as it blew out through the holes
would cause the shot to "twist." It must
be borne in mind that but a very small
quantity ol slow- burning powder is neces
sary.
When the revolving shot reached the
atmosphere it would behave just the same
as if tired from a rifled cannon. The ex
periments that have been made prove
this.
The first experiment made by Colonel
Bell at the Presidio about a year ago was
to compare the forces of his and common
solid conical shot.

PERFECT TREES ONLY THREE INCHES HIGH
The most interesting feature of the for
estry and herbaceus collection of Cornell
University is one recently added, consist- I
Ing of specimens of perfect forest trees j
less than three inches high. They were
brought to the university from the Arctic
rations by a party of explorers sent out
by the institution itself. The most nota
ble features of the collection are the Arctic
birch and the crowberry, which are shown
in the accompanying illustration.
Nowhere in this country, so far as
known, does a museum contain perfect
specimens of the birch. The curious
growth is occasionally to be found on the
top of Mount Washington, but no one has
ever before been able to secure one of these
tiny trees in absolutely perfect condition.
The specimens which Cornell has were
found on the Greenland coast, some at
Goduaven, on the isle of Disko. Others
were discovered at \Vilcox Head, where
the exploring party that secured spec- !
niens did most of its work. A curious dif
ference between this Liliputian birch and
the ordinary forest tree of the same species
is that the Arctic specimen bears fruit.
The trees on the island of DisKo were
covered with fruit when the explorers
found them. Wuat is more, this fruit is
decidedly edible. It has a taste not un
like tne juniper-berry, and is said to be
exceedingly health-giving.
Ever so many persons have read ot this
little birch tree under the scientific name
of Betnla nana without having any idea
of what the name really signified.
Translated it means white birch, and
those who have read of the struggles of
Dr. El is X a Kent Kane and his companions
in the A rctic regions a half-century ago
will remember what an important part
the Betula nana took in sustaining the
life of the members of the expedition.
The berries which grow upon the birch
seem to have all the concomitants of food
and drink, and upon them a person may
exist for a long time without materially
losing strength.
The second notable specimen is known
as the crowberry, or, as the scientists term
it, the Empetrum nigrum. While this
tree is in a measure a cosmopolitan plant,
although classed as an Arctic growth, the
same difficulty has been experienced in
securing perfect specimens as in the case
of tlie birch. The crowberry grows in thii
country â on Mount Desert, in Maine â and
is occasionally found at the bigheÂ«t points
of the Sierra Nevada range of mountains.
Like the birch, it bears an edible berry,
and it is no exaggeration to state that it is
one of the principal sources of succulent

food in the lofty region where it grows. ;
Several years ago an exploring expedi
tion to the Arctic regions very thoroughly
investigated the crowberry for the pur
pose of discovering what difference there
was, if any, between the Arctic growth
and the same tin}' tree growing on Mount
Desert The result was a curious illustra
tion of the novel effect of climatic condi
tions upon natural growths. The berry of
the crowberry as it grows on Mount Desert
has a marked acidity which, far from ren
dering it unpalatable, makes it more
agreeable as an article of food. The crow
berry in the Arctic zone has a decidedly
sweetish taste, and yet withal if one eats
several of the berries there is the pucker
ing -ensation about the mouth that is no
ticeable after eating persimmons. Thess
facts were determined by analysis, and
the most careful reasoning and investiga
tion arrived at no other result than that
! c irr.atic conditions were the cause of the
difference mentioned.
Those odd specimens of Arctic growth
are all the more notable because of the
fact that of the several hundred species of
plants which grow in the Arctic regions
the great majority are herbs. Few of
these, however, are annuals. The condi
tions existing in the Arctic zone seem to
fayor the herbaceous plant above all
things. The subterranean stems of these
seem to be the most efficient vehicle to
carry the lives of the plants over the long
and severs winter. In fact, no woody
plants â with the exception of those men
tioned in this article â growing in the
Arctic regions deserve to be called trees
or even shrubs in the ordinary sense of
lha term. Their stems are prostrate,
sending up short, leafy branches, which
expand flowers and bear fruit in an in
credibly short time.
A third specimen of the dwarf trees
which was brought back by the Cornell
party is the Arctic willow. There is the
Arctic willow proper, and then what is
known as the "bear" willow. It and the
herbaceous willow grow within the limits
of the United States, upon the tops of the
highest mountains, notably Mount Wash
ington. The reticulated willow is a very
beautiful plant, the rarest of them all.
The Cornell party discovered a specimen
on the Labrador coast. They had great
difficulty in securing a perfect willow of
this sort, and the specimen that now rests
in Cornell Museum is believed to be the
only one in existence away from its native
climate.

suit. He then fired one of his shots of the
same weight and with the same amount
of powder. The result was startling, for
the recoil was so great that tlie twenty
four-pounder was turned over and broken,
and the shot was carried far out to sea.
Subsequent experiments made a few
weeks later only served to strengthen the
theory. Colonel Bell's shots were fired
three or four times as far as a common
solid phot with the same weight of powder.
Their accuracy left nothing to be desired.
The shot showed the highest initial ve
locity and struct with, the most remark
able precision, although the gun used was
an o!d discarded one badly rasted.
Colonel Bell is an old artilleryman and
feels that his invention is perfect. It has
already attracted the attention of the War
Department and there is little doubt but
that it will soon be generally adopt d.
The importance of this wonderful pro
jectile does not lie so much in what
might be made of it as in the fact that it
will render a vast number of so-called
worthless guns of the greatest value.
"Those old cannon are only fit for old

now.
Of the old guns referred to there are
about ::00of them lying at the forts around

but have simply been considered as scrap

from the exact resemblanca in every slight
detail to the ereat trees of the same spe

States. For instance, the leaf is precisely
the same, and the general appearance of
the wood exhibits no difference. With
the willow it is curious to note the
leaf formation and the quality of sap that
exudes from a twig when the bark is re
moved tnerefrom. The texture of the

remove them. The value of all these
guns in the United States has been esti
mated a $300,000,000.
By making use of Colonel Bell's pro
jectile it would seem as if they all became
of their original value again. More than
their original value, because they will fill
the places now taken by guns worth a
quarter of a million.
With such a vast amount of guns on
hand the United States can claim to be
the best defended Nation in the world.

A modern fort, with three or four rifled
nine-inch cannon, is considered "a tough
place co tackle." What would a fort be
with thirty or forty not rifled, but just
as effective. Another advantage of Colonel
Bell's projectile lies in the fact that the
"lile" of a smooth-bore gun is many times
that of a rifled cannon.
The more the apparent advantages of
Colonel Bell's projectile are considered
the more valuable his invention become?.

All were in heavy marchin? order, with
rifles and bslts containing 100 rounds of |

j they overcame difficulties was very com
j mendable.
Company H's team was the first to
â  make an assault on the ten-foot wall, and
it made a record of 441Â£ seconds, that was
not equaled during the day. When it is
considered that the content included the

Tne scaling of the fifteen-foot wall was
more difficult, and the men had some nar

lived its usefulness and is an incongruous
feature of the sylvan scene.
Proceeding about a quarter of a mile we
reach the parting of tiie waysâ a fork in
ihe road that is quite misleading, for the
i most-traveled way is the one not to fol-
I low. Take the branch on the right that
run", up the steep side of a hill. It's only I
100 yards to the top, but it's easier to walk, j
Here the soil is adobe and for a short dis- i
tance is badiy broken up, but later in the
season it will be all right. The road is j
cut out of the side of a cnain of hills.
Below, to the left, is a narrow, deep valley, â 
tliickly wooded, but one looks over the i
tops of the hi*he3t trees. The sweet scent
of willows comes on the air, and the gurg
ling 01 water over a pebbiy bed is heard.
A little further 0:1 the lake itself bursts
into view. Blue and clear as the sky
above it stretches away and away be
tween breaks in the hills, seen here and [
there through opening3in the overhang- i
ing foliage. Involuntarily o:ie thinks of I
pictures that he has seen of the lakes of
Killarney.
Directly opposite the eminence on
which we stand is tbe great dam, covered
with the greenest of grass. At its ba3o a
few head of cattle are feeding, and beyond
the white sail of a boat glints in the sun.
The water is ud to the limit, and a foam- 1
crested cataract pours, under a bridge of
btone, and is guided through an open con
duit into the vale below. The cascade
roars like a miniature Niagara, and is the J
only sound -that breads the stillness of the
spring day.

the shores of the lake, which is apparently J
of vast extent, though in reality it is less ]
than six miles long. Ferns and flowers j
grow on the bank to th? right, and the i
wild honeysuckle hangs in festoons here â¢
and there.

| of America's most noted horse on exbibi
j tion in the museum of Natural History in
I New York.
The museum has an excellent collection
â  of the equine species from the period ol
the five-toed horse, that is no larger than
a fox, but there is no specimen of the
modern horse. This shortcoming was
observed a few weeks ago by John H.
Wallace, the Historian of the trotting
horse, and be volunteered to pay the bill
for procuring the skeleton of a represen
tative American trotting horse if the
museum authorities would give it a place
in the collection. This they were glad
to do.
Mr. Wallace at once thought of Ham
bletonian as the horse of all horses to be
piaced on view, and took measures to ob
tain permission to exhume his skeleton.
Ham bletonian, as all horsemen are aware,
was the first really great trotting sire ever
known, ana his descendants comprise
more than 96 per cent of all the fast trot
ters now on the turf.
When the old "Hero of Chester" died,
in 1876, he was tmried with honors on a
high nill on ttie William M. Ilysdyk
place, overlooking the little village of
Chester, Orange County, which he had
made famous throughout the horse world.
About ten years a?o the trotting-horse
breeders of the country raised a fund for
placing a monument above Hamble
tonian's grave, and a granite shaft now
marks the resting-place of the renowned
stallion.
Mr. Wallace last week obtained consent
to the proposed plan of digging up the
skeleton of the old horse, ana the work
will probably b* done within a few days.
It is the intention oi the museum authori
ties to place on exhibition at some future
time the skele;on of a representative thor
oughbred racehorse, a draught-horse and
a common cart-horse, in addition to that
of the great trotter. â The Collector.

' By a gradual descent the road reaches
the lowlands at the head of the lake,
1 which is left belrnu and the Castro Val
ley entered. Here are the homes of many
sniali farmer-: and stockmen. In plÃces
the wheeling is hard, but the roads will
soon gel broken down. Rushing down a
sharp declivity between two farmhouses
we are again on the San Leandro road,
this time at a bridge near Haywards,
I having mad* a detour ot about eight
i miles.
If this ride seems a bit too long go up
i into the canyon at Lanndry Farm. A
little more than a mile from Fruitvaie a
I crossroad leads to Mills College. It is
i smooth and well Kept. Follow it past the
! bridge at the entrance of the seminary,
! and if the grade is too hard for you walk a
few yams to the top of the incline. Then
comes a gentle slope. If you keep on tbe
main drive you'll pass through a pretty
piece of country, but will soon get into
the foothills and rind it advisable to re
trace your way. But turn sharply to the
left and bold the wheel in check unti! you
reach the bed of the creek below Laona

one place you must cross on a single

by an automatic railway, and enter the

where one seldom sees a bicycle. Beyond
this it is not pleasant to ride, though there
are paths which may be pursued for some
distance in various directions. But climb
to the top of one of the many ridges and
yon may obtain a splendid view of Oak
land, Alainftda, Berkeley, the bay, San
Francisco and the Golden Gate. The trip
is a short one and the recompense more
than ample.
Back of Oakland is the road into Jack
Hays Canyon, starting from Temescal,
which is extremely picturesque, but rather
too hilly for real enjoyment. The same
may be said of the route into Moraga Val
ley by way of the Fish ranch. The am
bitious road-rider, however, will do well
not to miss the scenic charms here to ba
found.
Should you desire to visit Martinez

county road at Golden Gate station, and
you will find fairly goo I wheeling, bar â¢

'TWAS ONLY A SUBURBAN INCIDENT.
Oh, country, creen and fair!
Oh, apple trees waving there!
How sweet thy cool retreat.
How full or rest'
Caroled Mr. Middlerib in a voice like a
cracked accordion and with a beautiful
disregard of air and words as he thought
of the aevr country home he bad just pur
chased, "near two lines Of streetcars and
not more than five minutes' walk from the
Town Hall."
"Now, my dear," he said, speaking to
Mrs. Middlerib, who was preparing to
pack up, "we will be able to spend the
rest of our days in peace and comfort.
I'm glad I aoM out the meusly old store,
even if I did get only half what it was
worth. I'm getting too old for business;
let the young fellows have a chance. No
more getting out of bed at daylight to
hurry down to the store so that the clerks
can't knocK down half the morning re
ceipts for me. I'm going to enjoy life,
I am."
It may be remarked that Middlerib had
not been able to stand noise of any sort
since he sold his clarionet.
Then he went downtown to find an ex
pressman who would not charge more
than $13 a load for transporting furniture
across the bay.
"Oh. this is great!" said Mr. Middlerib
tht afternoon they got comfortably and
cozily settled. "Captain Pookdeck, a re
tired sea captain, who lives next door,
keeps a cow and will supply us with
plenty of fresh sweet milk. Mr. Whack
em, in the next block, is an honest team
ster, they say, and can do any little haul
ing we may need from town. Dr. Pill
stuff, across the streer, has a splendid
dog that he says keeps an eye on the en
tire neighborhood and that we need have
no fear of tramps or burglars. I think we
shall lead a quiet and happy life here."
Early that evening Mr. Middlerib got a
breathing spell, and sat out on his front
porch and solemnly contemplated the
hammer-bruises and tack-punctures and
abrasions of stove- legs and pinches of ob
stinate stovepipes tnat adorned his fin
gers, and wondered if Providence would
not kindly strike the House with light

Take a day off, or go on Sunday â after
church, of course. Cross to Sausalito,
then steer toward Tamalpais, once bean
tifnl to b'hold, now cruelly gashed by
ruthless progress in the guise of a scenic
railway. The cross-like scar made by an
avalanche is still there, but does not mar
the mountain's face as does the work of
man.
The road has many bends, bat in half
an hour you may reach Mill Valley and
rive into the rrdwoods. Rest here a whiie,

content.
The sun was just sinking out of sight,
throwing long bars of . burnished gold
athwart the horizon. The air was Boit ,
and balmy, and the dreamy hum of insect
life floated in to Mr. Middlerib a3 he sat
and drank in the glory of the scene.
So peaceful, so fraught with every attri
bute of nature that he loved was it all
that Middlerib wondered if he could stand
so much happiness 365 days running.
He was just about to bjeak into a Dean
of praise for his good fortune when there
was the sound as of a smalt but energetic
hurricane coming down the street. Min
gled with the tramping of heavy animal

"Wi.oa! who-oh-oh-oo! wboal Yon

"Head him off, Bill! Whoa!"
A bie gray mule, with a paintbrush tail,
came skirmishing down the road ahead of
a mob of boys and men, head and tail in
tbe air, and doing his best to kick every
animated object that came within range.
It was plain that one of Mr. Wbackem's
males bad got loose, and Middierib's sur
mise was proved correct when the honest
teamster and bin three sons appeared in
hot pursuit. Middlerib groaned as the
animal was cornered and his dream of
rural bliss fled.
; "Whoa ! Don' throw him ! Whoa, you

After viewing the prison you may â if not
legally embarrassed â continue the ride to
San Rafael, Petaluma, Fairfax, San Au

From San Anselmo begins the cycler's
road to Camp Taylor, and up the Russian
River or its picturesque tributaries. From
Koss station you wiil find it worth while
to follow tbe Lagunitas to Liberty.
To got iito the depths of a rclwood for

White's Hill, the road being too steep and
crooked to ride in either direction. Once
beyond this forbidding eminence you
plunge into a real wilderness. Some of
the trees are veritable giants. Two cyclists
with their wheels may stand within the

While the retired mariner was bawling
for his cow the hurricane returned.
g It came in a whirlwind of dust, whoops,
paint-brush tails, clods and sticks.
â  From the center of disturbance shot
forth bawls, brays, yells, and presently,
just as Pookdeck's cow emerged from an
alley just in time to join in the festivities,
the discordant clangor of a cowbell.
Pookdeck ran out into the street to try
to head off the procession, while Middlerib
sank on his knees and crammed his
lingers into bis ears.
Just as Pookdeck had howled in his
best storm-at-sea voice, "What'n tnunder's

keeping an eye on tne entire neighbor

gled up the whole works right in front of

The complicated movements that fol
lowed placed the captain right in line, and
he was promptly tossed over the Middle

howling like a dervish for whisky and
arnica.
While Middlerib was administering
these to .the suffering ex-mariner the cow
and mule, hemmed in on one side by the

FASHION'S FADS AND FANCIES
Parisian .Models for Easter
tide.
This week is to be exceedingly gay, and
numerous are tho beautiful frocks being
designed for tne dinners, dances and
lunches, so a description of some Parisian
creations will be welcome.
At a recent dinner several gowns were
especially mentioned, among others cne
of velvet-glace hortensiaand mauve, made
with a iong plain skirt and low pointed
bodice with tulle and tufts of hydran
gea round the low-cut neck. Speaking
Of evening toilettes the fad for the mo
ment is to nave the nocks all cut square,
and they are not as low as formerly. A
youthful bride possesses a rarely charm
ing white taffeta; *lie low bodice is veiled
with fine lace covered with a dainty pat
tern; a full lace flounce is arranged so as
to fall as an epaulet over the short,
si gbtly puffed sleeves of the taffeta,
which are first veiled with tulle sprinkled
with crystal beads that sparkle like dew
drops under the lace.
Two lace shawis ars used to drape tne
skirt, but how they are so carefully
manipulated Is a mystery which only an
expert dressmaker could comprehend.
White orchids and convolvuli adorn the
bodice, and the convolvuli are to be
great favorites for both hats and gowns
this summer. The same bride is reported
to be a vision of loveliness in a dinner
costume of rich tinted velours raoire
trimmed most artistically with rare old
lace. This is carried down one side of the
skirt, across the front. The bodice is
ulashed in points, showing a velvet two
shade* darker beneath, veiled with lace.
Velours nioire is enjoying great popu
larity, and as a result several brides have
selected it for their wedding dresses.
At a large dinner in Paris, given about
three weeks aeo, the beauty and simplicity
of the Countess TourieUi's dress was
remarked, it being of white moire,
spangled witu tiny silver spangles in the
water-mark. "The skirt was made demi
train. A wide scarf of point d'Angleterre
came from the right shoulder across the
front of bodice to tne left hip, whence it
fell at the back lite a sash end, with a few
Parma violets intermixed; another lace
end to match fell at the back, stat ting from
the waistband of satin, the color of the
violets. The bodice seemed entirely of
point d'Angleterre, draped and arranged
to form the shore sleeves, from which fell
a fringe of Parma violets on the arm. The
cream Kid gloves had long lace tops,
fastened around the arm at the top with
violet ribbon; white siiK stockings em
broidered with mauve, and amethyst satin
shoes completed this elegant dress. Com
tesse de Fels wore a pretty gown of tur
quoise satin, made in princess shape, and
draped with pale blue tulle powdered
with silver spangles; tins was looped on
â  he left aide with bunches of pink poppies,
having black centers powdered with
diamond dust; the low bodice was draped
with tulle like a crossed ticbu, and round
the shoulders a bouilionne of tulle with
pink j oppies nestled in it; poppies also on
the shoulder; satin waistband, enriched
with jewels."
At a similar affair great was the ad
miration t-xcited by a creation ol white
China crepe. Round the bottom of the
skirt vas wrought with pearls aud gold Ha

DESCRIPTION OF HAT.
An 1837 poke for an 1897 girl. This deliehtiul poke is made of baby straw. The brim is
lined beneatb with ruffliiigs of soft whitj chiff n resting on a bandeau of pinK roses, while a
bunch of feathers is fixed on to the high-pointed crown, and It in tied under the chin with
whtte wide itrings. Wide strings arc the fashion at the moment
with white mtin, and rested on a thick
ruche of white satin ribbon. The train
was adornefl on the left side with a twist
of pink tolle, held in nt intervals with
pink ribbons. On the left side was a lone
trail of white lilacs and roses that followed
the side seam of the train. The low bodice
was really delightfully pretty, being of
pink and white tulla ornamented with
flowers.
Ball dresses are bÂ»ing made in large
numbers of white or colored tulle in Paris,
London and New York. The tulle is
literally covered with spangles, and is
draped or pieale-1 over white or colored
slips. The ekirt* nre round, and the
bodiceÂ« lavisr.ly trimmed with lulls and
the most wonderful of artificial flowers;
and this season great advance hns been
made in the art of manufacturing flowers;
indeed, it may be almost said that man
has succeeded in rivaling nature in the
perfection of his handiwork, for blossoms
never reproduced before arÂ» now lo be had.
Â»nd our favoritesâ the roses, violets,
daisies, pansies and lilies of the valley â
have been so improved as to make all those
m?de in the years gone by look very
ordinary.
One of ihe new models is a black gauze '
dress, with narrow satin stripes, tie skirt i
plain in front, plisse Â»t the back, edged !
with a small gathered flounce with pleate 1 j
head; at the top of this skirt a wide
cream lace is laid on flat, to simulate long
pointed basques; the same lace placed on
the bodice meets it in front and thus sim- j
ulates a long jacket front, drawn in with j
a white satin waistband with bow at the !
bacic. The bodice has a flat back, and the
iron' plisse with yoke of lace, and epau
lets ot three flounces plisses over moyen- j
age sleeves falling over the hand; high j
white satin neckband with a sznall plisse ;
ot the same at the back. Ail the gauze
of this dress is mounted over dark blue i
silk. Another pattern dress is pearl gray
taffetas, the skirt plain and round, with '
three small godets at the back, the lower j
part of the skirt braided in a large pat
tern with gold and silver braid, edt:ed j
with a line of gray gauze; the taffetas
bodice is covered with this gauze, striped ,
with gold and silver braid, a yoke of the
same braided across with a pattern like j
the skirt. Plain sleeves gathered at the I
seams, the top formed by a bouffant of
three taffetas flounces edged with doubled
gauze. Neckband and waistband of cerise
saiin with enamel buckie, red and gold,
and two little cerise bows on the left side j
in the cause of the bouffant.
Extremely dainty is a creation owned i
by a young woman with golden hair aDd j
a complexion that would delieht an ar
tist, so delicate are the tints. It is of a i
lettuce-green shade of mousseleine de j
soieand sun pleated. White lace insertions
cut across the pleating, great skill being
shown in the particular direction which is ;
f iven to these lines, as it is quite possible,
merely by transverse lines of lace, to ac
centuate width at the shoulders and slen- ;
derness at the waistâ likewise to impart
some beautiful curves to the full skirt.
This dress is cut ala redingote. By this I j
mean that it is an overdress with fronts j
opening from front to hem. The under- j
dress, which is perfectly en evidence j
whenever the wearer moves, is of white
India silk, pleated. At the throat the
green chiffon is turned back in the form
of a deep shirred collar of the chiffon.
The waist is encircled with a little belt of
white satin shaped to the figure aud !
pointed at the back.
Laferriere is an undisputed authority, i
so his advice is always valuable. SpeaK
ing of his firm a correspondent states that â 
ii i 9 busily employed in making up gren- j
adine gauzes, light chine silks, and very
line cashmere, with trimmings of white j
embroidery in the guipure style, lace and f
braided gaions. The skirts are not made
so wide, but always cored and plain at the
top, and are either plain or plisse soleil, or
with flounces according to the material
employed. The bodices have immense
revers, also Boleros separate or initated j
with trimming; some match the skirt, I
others are quite different, but are made
bouffant in front, well drawn in toward
the waist, and rinished with silk or velvet
bands ot a contrasting color. As eiarai le,
a plain round skirt of light woolen beige j
had a vandyked pattern of narrow black {
velvet round the hem, the bodice was en- I
tirely different, made of orance taffetas !
glace, with white pleated; in the middle j
of the back and front a wide band of white
embroidery over orange silk going down,
witha Vandyke of black velvet on each
side. The sleeves, gathered at the seam,
bouffant at the top, waistband of orange
silk with small bow standing up at tne
bacK.
A good gown of black satinâ made
hereâ has on the skirt a series of three
frills of accordion-plaited scarlet tulle;
the biack bodice is covered with the tulle,
and the square necK ia outlined with a
row of the brightest crimson poppies, with
velvety black centers. The belt is of biack
satin. Such a com bination is correct at the
present moment when a dash of crimson
is declared the thing about almost every
costume and hat; indeed so greatly is it
in favor that I hear of one leader of lash
ion who Das ordered a complete set ot
crimson lingerie, as that color is most be
coming to her. I certainly do not care for
such fads in underwear, preferring white,
the palest blue or a delicate pink. Even
gloves are stitched in crimson, eutiie p&ra

sols of scariet silk are shown, but, except* â¢
ing for use at the seaside or in the coun- '
try, they are to be most carefully avoided,
j being far too gay and conspicuous for gen
eral use.
Foulards are justly popuhr, so excellent
I and cheap are they, and so lovely when ,
\ handled carefully. One of our best-known >
houses here hai been selling them at 50 :
cents per yard, and those offered have
been artistic in design and dainty in col !
| oring. Imagine how a Sevrea blue fou
lard would look made with a skirt plain at
! the top, having three flounces round the j
. bottom edged with black lace and headed i
: with a band of white lace put on in seal- !
I lops! The foulard bodice fits snugly aud i
j is beautified at the top with wide plisses, j
I forming a deep collar with white lace; i
i long gathered sleeves, with pleated
i flounces forming epaulets at the shoulders.
Gray is exceedingly fashionable, and
i one cuic gown of the new satin cloth is
I made with^ basqued jacket which has
I open fronts. A white satin band ancir
i cles a slender waist and is secured in the
back with two rhiuestone buttons. The
I vest is of white chiffon crossed just
below the necfc with v latticework of nar
j row green velvet helu down with tiny
; rhinestone buttons. Tae vest is made
over white satin, but the lining of the en
tire gown is of a taffeta silk light green in
shade. Another visiting dress is made of
one of the new soti corded woolens of t!ia
J fashionable smoke shade. The front of
' the bodice displays lines of drawn thread
i intermingling with rows of gold and black
! embroidery, made up pinafore fashion
over white satin and chiffon, a frill of lace
I at the throat, and the sleeves arranged
j with diagonal tucks in sets of three. It
was accompanied by a short cape, like a
sacque - backed coat with cape sleeves.
; The bat was quite charming, black, and
was trimmed with the new brilliant gauze
and black plumes, but made with a dou
: ble brim, having so;t cerise poppies peep
inc between the two.

j feelings of relief the handsome etamines,

They are, if possible, more dainty than
! ever. Some I much admire have wide
i pink and white stripes figured in moire
! effect. Of course all colors are obtainable
\ and make up charmingly. In all the linen
shades are shov/n the Egyptian and the
Lanpett tissues, as welt as in every tint
and color. These must all be made over
I solid colors, presumably over silk slips,
1 although I see one writer says on this sub
i ject: ''The silk nnderdresses, however,
! are no longer considered indispensable,
and the colored lawns whicti are used in
stead do not cost nearly so much." Still,
I advise you all to keep on using silk if
you wish such frocks to be a success, for
| the saving of a few dollars will cause you
more annoyance than enough if you have
j the usual experience with lawns.
Etamine in grenadine effects is in great
voeue, and you can have it in plaids,
stripes, checks and in linen tints with
I silken embroidery.
Those in mourning are welcoming, with
j a feeling of relief, the very handsome eta
| mines, which are made over the best taf-
I feta silk for summer wear. They are de
lightfully cool and comfortable.
So great is the beauty of the new bro
caded silks that both the young and old
will order them in large quantities for
dinner gowns, and the colored etamines
are simply bewitching on account of their
possibilities of combinations, especially
when ribbons and oriental embroideries,
are artistically employed.
From Paris has just come a gown in
which lettuce green is used as a good con
trast to a dark blue fancy canvas. The
double materials are novelties illustrated
by a pink figured canvas, with black
grenadine interwoven on its surface. In
another French dress this formed the
skirt, sleeves and back of the bodice, the
full front being of satin that matched the
canvas, and over it was a black lace
zouave with white lace applique and jet;
extending down the front was a pli-se ot
cbiffou and butter-colored insertion,
which was also car ied aroun 1 the throat.
Mohair canvas will continue in favor lor
all dusty occasions anil the kismet suiting
is to be extensively worn for golf and
bicycle suits.
Walking.
The art of walking is certainly not un
derstood by many women, and a critic,
writing from New York, anxiously in
quires why so many well-built, stylish
young women are walking heel tirst, jerk
ing their shoulders and moving their arms
with a rotary motion. Such questions
would take some time to answer, for cer
tain most ungraceful motions of the body
have bo en taken up at times by foolish
young women, who would have more
sense could they but realize how com
pletely they ruin the effect and style of
the most chic of gowns and jackets by
such nonsense.
It is perfectly true that most children
are not taught to walk properly, they
teuca themselves with greater or less suc
cess.
A bright American, while visiting at
Aix les Bains, met a young woman, with
whom she took several long walks. After
the first excursion she began to notice
that her companion felt le>s fatigue than
she did, and always returned with her
skirts in excellent condition, even when
the roads had been either muddy or
dusty. This state of affairs caused her
considerable surprise, so at length she
asked for an explanation, and was prompt
ly told that her acquaintance had
taken a course of walking lessons, so she
i writes: " I soon sought her instructor,
and have ever since profited by his in
struction. Now lam mistress of tho situ
ation as well, and can likewise not only
walk greater distances and with less
fatigue than formerly, and return with
j garments equally nice, but I find that said
garments will remain in condition longer
than before, and that my carriage is
astonishingly improved.
"The following is the formula, which is
piven here in order that men, women and
children may become their own trainers
and instructors, if they have first the de- I
sire to do all thing* as well as possible: j
Hold the body erect, with the head up;
walk from the waist, not the Knees; bend
the knees, pick up the feet and walk on
the ball of the foot. This insures a cer
tain elasticity and buoyancy, so that the
pedestrian almost feels that he is tread
ing on air or walking on rubber tires, so to
speak."
Â«How to Lift Our Skipts.
At least a dozen times l have wished to
touch on this topic, but could not satisfy
myself thut I Had made my explanation
lucid, but Vogue covers the points I ae
sire.l 10 make clear in these few lines:
"Throw the extra back fullness of the
skirt over the back of the hand (which
should be closed) and placed as a handle
at one side of the body and slightly bend
the forearm forward. The fullness of tiie
skirt will thus bo found to remain in
place, and will not cause the fatigue to the
nand ana wrist that one experiences In the
old way of holding so much weight of
material in the band. This is a decided
saving on gloves, since it does not s-tretch
them, or soil them, or cause the hand to
become overheated, and skir.s lifted in
this way look much more graceful than
1. Gown of pavement trray, fine cloth, trimmed with braid. The Mttle bolero has epaulet
sleeves and closes on the left snouider. Silk waist of short rose and greou.
2. Gowu of silk aud wool mixed, trimmed witb bilk to match and narrow black velvet
ribooii.
when they are held in the hand. One's
anatomy is also less liable to be ernpba
â ized. and it gives one an ease and cer
tainty that all the fullness is properly
looked after, while at the same time, petti
coat, ankles and shoes ate more becom
ingly exposed. Even with care and atten
tion and the anj-ropnating of suggestions,
such as the above, in spite of all some
women return home from a walk bedrag
gled and begrimed, while a companion
does not."
Tfyree Periods.
Thos* who have enJDyed weekly the
bright and witiy stories told by A.bert D
Vandain doubtless were given food for re
flection when they read this paragraph:
"Women wlio have not had the com
mand of money all their live*, and who
BUt<deni> tind themselves able to spend
large, or comparatively large, sums on
dress, provided dress anpeals to them,
generally traverse three periods. They
begin by ordering extravagantly and in
di-criminatingly, flinging money broad
cast. Then a period of discrimination â
one might say of deliberate hypercriti
cism â seis in, which costs to tlio lull as
much as the tirst. They no longer wish
to look like every one else, but aim at ex
clusiveness of material as well as cut.
The third period is the attempt to replace
the waning charms by every means the
milliner, dressmaker and nairdresser can
suggest, and at no matter what CMC"
In Olivia
Ellen Terry has been wearing a bewitch
ing cap which is beins universally copied,
so 1 describe It as besi I can. It is caught
up in a point with a knot of ribbon above
the hair and frames tlie face most fascinat
ingly. I have changed my mind; instead
of a description allow me to refer you to
an illustrated copy of the Vicar of Wake
field. It is said to be a correct reproduc
tion of the cap in whicn we usually see the
fair Olivia. Exactly when our fair maids {
are going to wear such caps the corre- i
apondentdoes not state and I bin at a loss
to understand. However, we mint know
all that is going on in the fashionable
world, so do not say I have so much as
omitted a cap.
In this quaint play we can readily com
prehend how great an effect the delightful
frocts produce, for in those days the
women draped the softest and creamiest of
muslin fichus about their throats, frilled
their short sleeves and looped back their
gowns to show a bright petticoat of crim
son stuff.
These costumes were so well received
that one fashion journal goes so far as to
predict that before the summer is over we
will be wearing very similar dresses, hut
in England the revival of the early Vic
torian styles is being warmly discussed
and one fair Duchess will shortly give a
great hall at which all her guests will wear
the garments lasuioned after tlioso of sixty
years ago.
Eastern .Noveities.
A bright mind his evolved a new idea
which promises to become very >>opuiar,
and de^ervi-dlv so. It in called picture
dressing, and is the result of careful
studies made by modistes of portraits of
women painted by famous artists.
There is no particular style that governs
this newest method of selecting costumes,
except the individuality of the person
who is to wear what is sought.
The effect is invariably successful. A
recent instance oJ this was the case of a
very graceful young woman who wore a
dre-s copied from one seen in a painting
by Sir Joshua Reynolds. This dress wai
veiled in lace, and boasted of a train clev
erly disposed like a regal mantle of red
velvet, a deep Venetian royal red that
ma'ched the liquid light of rubies.
One very pleasant fealure of this idea is
that it enables the use of costumes worn
ever so long ago, and which the owners
bad possibly believed to be so thoroughly
out of style that it would be hopeless to
try to utilize them. It is a fact that any
style, If it is only a picture dress, will do,
always provided it is becoming, and this
has resulted in many a fashionable woman
saving half her usual wardrobe expenses.
There is nothing difficult about follow
ing this fashion. All that one need to do
is to visit the portrait section of some art
gallery, and there find the picture of some
lady of long ngo robed in a fashion which
will be truly becoming to the visitor.
Thon she can say when she dons her new
gown, even though it be an old one fixed
over, that she had made it after the style
ot the dress worn by one of the ladies
whom Sir Joshua Reynolds had painted,
or that it was an exact copy of the attire
of a Gainsborough beauty. Certainly it is
a very clever fad, and as this is the season
of economy, or rather the year of it, every
woman should hail the idea with extreme
satisfaction.
It looks more and more as if embroidery
was going 10 play a moie important part
than ever in evening dress. Plain skirts
will suraly look conspicuous. The em
broidery is filling up the hiatus between
the absence of any trimming at all and
draped and trimmed skirts which are
coming our wayâ slowly it may be, but
surely.
The effect of these long lines of fine
work in velvet, outlined with silver, crys
tal and brilliants up the seams, is excel
lent It gives height to the figure and im
portance to the skirt, a part of our dress
which during the epoch of voluminous
sleeves was somewhat neclected, save only
so far as fit aud cut were concerned. At
present the balance is much more equal,
and this is greatly to our advantage. It
is a fashion, 100, thnt is kind to women
who are not tali, and isalso not altogether
out of place with those unfortunate per
sons who are inclined to stoutness, while
tiiey lack in height.
Of course, there is a wide range in em
broidery, and a dress may be made as
costly as one pleases, but the idea is capa
ble of being utilized by all of us whose
purses are as short as our wants are long.
Then, too. there are many effective sub
stitutes for embroidery. One of tiie.-e,
which I can recommend, is chine gauze
ribbon. The design may be outlined and
jeweled at home, and the effect is all that
could be desired. Then there are jetted
and jeweled galons which may be used
over and ovÂ«r aeain.
It is said, too, that before long tapering
sprays of embroidery will be sold all
ready to apply to the seams of the even
ing gowns. There are already those in
lace which can be wrought with brilliants
at intervals and thus made exceedingly
effective.

anything about the game do not require a
teacher, who can only explain the intrica
cies of coif, but one who understands
what it means to play in skirts and cor
sets. Therefore, here is another opening
for feminine enterprise, as no man could
possibly teach them how to overcome the
problem of petticoats in relation to this
game, as for them golf must be modified,
it being impossible for a woman to com
pete with men on even terms hampered
with her skirts.
An experienced golfer says: "The pro
fessional man golfer, is whatever country
you find him. is not able to teach a
woman to 'drive,' 'put' or 'lift' in a grace
ful woman fashion. Put him into a
woman's dress, and perhaps he might in
time evolve some golf-strokes leveled
down to skirt limitation, but it is doubt
ful. Start woman professionals, and the
same will assume a more charming as
pect. And women who at present play a
shocking game because they are striving
to rival a man's attitude and mannerism
might play admirably if they learned
their strokes from a woman's point of
view."
Undoubtedly these sentiments ara lauda- |
ble ones. The danger of most snorts is |
that women are apt to emulate men in
spit* of the inevitable handicap of sex.
But I must confess I should prefer seeing
novices taught to play the game in a
womanly way by competent amateurs,
simply for the love of the thing, without
widening the already too wide bounds of
professionalism. Marcella.
Fop .Men.
For evening and frock coats 1 have no
changes to rucord, ail men having their
shoulders cut square, carefully avoiding
the slanting effect which is so strikingly
unbecoming to the best of figures, and it
shouid be remembered that exaggerations :
of all kinds are to be studiously avoided i
by men wiio desire to be correctly garbed,
and such men never allow their tailors to !
send them home clothing that lacks mdi- I
viduality; but a man must let his tailor I
see that he understands what is correct, j
otherwise be will not take in nine cases :
out of ten a proper amount of interest in '
his customer.
In this country the sack coat is very !
popular for business. It has two side I
pockets and no breast pockets, as the !
breast pocket has gone entirely out of j
style, as 1 before noted, as our handker- |
chiefs must be kept out of sight, and in
no coat whatever can there be more than
two outside pockets, and the frock coat !
never has any vis.b e one.
The felt hat is in vogue in London, and
some of the best turned out young men
are ordering hats to match the color of j
their suits, grays and browns of many
tones being in demand.
Tne evening shirt with a single stud is ;
not in favor, those having three being
now considered corroct.
Cuffs are now perfectly square in shape,
and the collar may be sai i to be higher
and more uncompromising than ever, i
Smart men occasionally wear detached !
collars, but detached cuffs are not perm is- i
sible.
Him tells us that for the evening we
may "wear sm ill gold studs of a dull fin- '
ish. Link cuff buttons of gold â Roman i
finish â with your monogram engraved I
thereon. Wear no other jewelry, good, !
bad or indifferent."
Concerning glovos I note that dogskin i
and chevette will be the smartest, for j
glace kids are too shiny and dressy and :
the white kid excepting for evening wear
baa vanished, but it is still worn at many !
weddings in place of the pearl gray.

GOLF AND CYCLING SUITS.
There is to be ;i distinctive line drawn
this summer between golf and cycle suits,
and briefly it may be said that goii
knickers will have quarter-cuffs of bo 4
cloth closing with four or five button-.
Cycle knickers will not have quarter-cuffs,
bin a strap buckie at the knee. Many
men, however, will pay but slight atten
tion to this distinction ; not a few like the
quarter-top and turned-over-top goif hose,
and will not make the change at fashion's
dictate. _ C. C
Shoe Eyelets.
There are many tiling* which are sold
by the gross, and not a few that are sold
by the thousand, but there are not many
that are sold by the million. Among tho
things that are so soU, however, are shoe
eyelets.
Shoe eyelets are made of brass by ma
chines, whose operation is almost entirely
automatic. Three or four machines are re
quired to produce the eyelet in the form in
which it is sold, the brass being fed into
the tirst machine in thin, flat strips. As
sold to the shoe-manufacturer the eyelet
is turned down at one end only. Tne eye
lets look as much asanything likeso many
little hats with narrow brims and without
any tops in the crowns. The upper end
of the crown, which is like the end of a
little cylinder, is put through the eyelet
hole in the shoe, the finished brim or
flange of the eyelet resting against the
leather upon the outside. After the eye
let has thus been put in place its inner
end is turned down upon the leather by a
machine made for that purpose. In the
manufacture of the eyelets a number of
very slight vertical indentations are made
at equal distances apart in the outside of
the eyelet around tne prnooth, straight
end. When tiie shoe machine smashes
down tiie inner side of the eyelet the f
metal parts at these indentations and is
spread uniformly, thus giving it a secure
bold.
Eyelets are made of various sizes in di
ameter and of various lengths of shank or
cylinder, according to the thickness ot the
material with which they are to be used,
and after they come from the machines
they are fini3hed in great variety. Some
are finished white â these are silver plated;
some arp gilt finished and some are cop
pered. Eyelets are japanned in black or
in various shades or russet. They are in
fact made in any size and of any color
tiiat may be desired. Sooner or later the
i spanning wears off, exposing the bras?.
Tnere are now ma ie sho* eyelets that are
covered with celluloid, which keep their
color, but these are much more expensive
than the kind commonly used.
Shoa eyelera arc packed in boxes con
taining 1000, 10 000, 100,000, 250,000 and
500,000 each. Eve.ets of the kinds most
commonly used are sold, according to
sizes and styles, at prices ranging irom $6
to $135 a million. Some of the celluloid
eyelets sell for as much as $500 a million.
The sale of shoe-eyelets depends, of
course, somewhat upon the prevailing
style of shoe. When button-shoes are
more generally worn not so many shoe
eyelets are sold, but the numDer sold is
always very large.
Eyelets are made for a wide variety of
uses, up to tne great eyelets that are sewed
into the corners of sails, through which
sail is lathed to the end of the boom or
yard. Talcing them altogether tne num
ber is enormous Of shoe styles alone
tnere are sold in this country some ihou
sands of millions annually.â New York

jKe Jhree-Jrump Echo.
We have been asked several times of late to
express our views or opinion in regard to tbe
"three-trump echo." We have in preparation
an article of considerable length on this sub
ject, and expressing not only our views but
the views of others as well. We will say this
much, however: We believe the meaning
of the present system of echoing should
reversed. On a "call" for or a lead
trumps the partner now is asked
to "echo" if you hold four or more,
and sub-echo if he holds exactly three. Our
dea is to tcho to btiow three exactly, and sub
| echo to show four or more. A great deal can
and will be written on this subject, but in the
opinion of the writer It will eventually be
come the recognized system of play. To tell
your turtner exactly how many trumps
you ho!^ when he leads or calls for them at the
earliest opportunity possible is information
that is not only very valuable, but trick-win
ning and what he is most anxious to get.
Every whist-player knows that tnree trumps
are held oftener than four by the trump-lead
er's partner, and be ng able to read this hold
ing the trump lead can ofte-i be stopped or
continued as the urgency of the case requires
Making this change will not permit false card
ing in trumps to be of as much value as it is at
present.

ally whf-re the trumps are very sons I, queen. Jack
and any small card, 01 jack, tea and a small may
be opened, where the balance of the band is weak.
We object to the lead of queen from queen and one
small, or ten at the head of two or three, and more
particularly to the lead of any smaller card at the
top of a three-card suit. The lead from ace. king,
or queen and iv.o others, we regard aj disadvan
tageous. ,
We have Indicated above our chief argument In
favor of the trump lead. It is not that it It a good
lead In itself, except where the plain suits are
strong, bu; that a lead from a short suit Is worst-.
It is a choice be ween evils, the leaser of which we
be ieve to be the trump leal.
We Â»re well aware that our views in this respect
are not shared by all writers or expert players,
but we are not entirely without support. (Cav
endish. Hamilton, Trist and Brigcs are a quartet
in whose company we are not ashamed to be
found. Their views on this question are, we be
lieve, identical with those above expressed.'
Mr. Work is the only great, modern writer who
advises against the trump lead, though there are
many fine |iia ers who are with him. Our opinion
is not. however, based upon tlios- of the gentle
men mentioned. â¢ We experiments! lor years With
both lines of play, mod d scar Jed the short suit
lead only after becoming convinced from the re
sults of exp rimeatsln actual play that the lend
of the trump was better. The old Idea that a
! trump lead must Invariably be returned finds no
place wi.b us. It is senseless, especially in the
Â«ase of au original lead from four trumps. The
d' cislou of whether or not to return the trump
must rest In the sound discretion of the leader's
partner. " ' â  â¢ â  ; ' â 
With four trumps and a suit of four or more
cards, the lead of the plain suit is generally to be
pr-ferred. Where the plain suit Is established It
ma bes'jown, a da trump, led then; where the
trumps are ace king, queen and one small, or
ac, king, jack and one small, and the suit not ts
tabiis ie.i. on â â¢ lead of trumps lotlowed by the lead
from the plain suit Is good play. Where the hand
Is strong in all the suits, an original : lead of a
trump Is often better than the plain-salt lead. ' A
lead from three trumps or lest Is justifiable
only by strength In all the suits, or by one great
suit and protection in each of the others. ' _Wha t
w- have said applies only to the original lead
from, a band. ' . . ; . i .

MINES
& MINERS
The Panamint mining district, a hundred
j miles or so eastwara or southward from
I almost anywh"re in California, in the
! depths of the Mojave Desert and j
J perched h : gh above the western wall
of Death Valley, is the newest golu mm- |
ing district in California to claim a rush and
i space for Ircquent wild stories in the newspa
per.-. Ali the delightful chfirra of desert ter
: rors, desert desolation, aesert tragedies and
i nearness to the king of evil surrounds the
\ Panamint district from a picturesque potut oi
i view. Leaving the assay of the ho; desert
j rocks out of consideration the heert of the
i Mojavo Desert comes to tne from ready to sup
ply a new chapter and new pictures for the
varied story of the search of gold in earth.
These gold-finding stories must come and go
like visions. They depopulate the newest
minine camps and start hundreds Into a blind
and feverish ruth and get up the rest of the
symptoms of that aurifero-hysteria which
' everywhere marks the gold fever when made
I acute by a tale of a piece of gold found in a
j n w place.
The Panamint district has been prospected
'â  for many years and has been known as a gold
| repository for a generation. Reports of recent
: discoveries, reinforced by the effect of the
I Randsburg boom in the whole desert region,
1 has resulted in the recent flocking of Â»ome
! hundreds of prospectors to au almost Inacces
| Bible region.
There is gold In the Panaralnt region, but
there is hardly a place for gold in America
where the limit of minimum profit demands
so high an assay per ton. Water is scarcer
than gold, transportation is at fabulous rates
and of fuel there is none.
Last fall Â£. A. Wiltsee. the mining operator,
went there with Mr. Ncwhouse, his expert
mining engineer, looking for prospects he
cared to invest in. Three hundred samples
from thirty or forty claims in the neighbor
hood of Pleasant were carefully assayed, ac
cording to Mr. Newhouse, but nothing con
sidered wortti buying was found.
"We found nothing but unsatisfactory sur
face prospects," sayi Mr. Newhouse. "The
highest sample ran $27 to the ton and a few
reached $20. The next ihowed traces to a
few dollars."
However the latest reports of prospectors
from the Panamint range are booming ones,
with occasional stories of rock assaying $3000
â  to the ton.
The State Mining Bureau has been broad
\ ened out â inside â during the week. State
Mineralogist Conper has stepped into the of
fice to find the worry about the appropriation
over, and to find the bureau secure a^ain on a
j $'25,000 a year scale of operations. So more
i room has been taken by renting theremainiuÃ
half of the third floor of the Pioneer building,
' giving the institution the entire two upper
| floors. The new quarters will be devoted to
j the library and to office room, the old library
! quarters being turned Into private workrooms
I for the deputies and other employes.
Mr. Cooper has still larger hopes for the
J housing of the institution, however. He Is
j hoi afier the top floor of the new ferry-build
â  ing at the foot of Market street. The question
: is one of the big rent entirely, and the bureau
may or may not go there. Aside from fiuan
cial considerations the location would be
highly desirable for the bureau.
The way similar bureaus are carried on in
! thegold-proaucing British colonies comes forc
t lWy toimndbrsuggesiion. tfhe departments of
i mines of the colonies of Mritisn Columbia, New
, Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria and Went
1 Australia are more Interesting than valuable
as examples In many things, however, for the
paternalism they display womd not all be wel
come here. Uhese departments of the provin
cial Governments are run on the theory that
\ the minerals in the ground will add wealth,
, population and prosperity to the colonies to
I the extent to *hieh they are dug out of the
! ground, and that departments of mines are es
{ tablished to bustltt up the digging. Hence
| they take the initiative in exploring the re
| sources, in stimulating prospecting, in luring
j capital from abroad, in improving processes,
! in bringing the best processes into use, in ad
i vertlsing the mineral resources to the world,
< and so on.
The prospector must precede development
and he is cherished. In New Zealand and
j some other provinces the minister of mine* is
I to him a rich, kind uncle who has no children.
j They fairly take him oat ami show him where
j to dig and how to do it. Here and there "fos
[ Kicking" boards will take him to the gold
i fields and set him to work if he is unemployed
I and nnsu't a red cent. The Department of
I M.nes is ready to teach any man the A B C of
r ;>i'l hunting. Published information is ready
and courses in elementary assaying, mineral
ogy and geology are free iv well-equipped lab
oratories.
In some of the colonies the Government will |
lend h'llf the capital need -d for developing
new mines. MÂ»ps and practical handbooks
travention to the statue concerning lotteries
and haying been notified of this decision the
journal at once abandoned the same.
The Attorney-General evidently has been
rending the bue laws of Connecticut. We
think it is hair-splitting on the part of the
authorities
The whist world got lots of good, valuable
iDiormation out of the same kind of coutest

of the Minister of Mines when he avers that
the promises of Victoria's gold supply are far
and away better tnan those of any other col
ony of the Australian group." We find that
the present mining development act allows
the Minister to advance to pioneer mining
companies this year a total ot Â£50,000 under
stringent conditions. No company may re
j eelve more than Â£10,000. For mining roads
: Â£15 000 a year is provided.
For advances to miners for prospecting
Â£5000 a year v given. Four or more persons
may form a combination for prospecting and
bonow up to Â£250 of thÂ« Minister if they can
satiny his many inquiries and put up as much
themselves. The Minister has Â£3500 a year
for a metallurgical plant and Â£2500 a year
for races to couvey water for fcluicing. The
act gave him money for an exhibition
of mining machinery and appliances,
which has just closed at Victoria, and
empowered him to send to England a lecturer
to convince the British public that Victoria is
trie star gold field to put money into. Tne act
provides Â£140,000 to run tne department this
way for three years and the Leader says that
it is a very small thing for a colony that has
spent Â£800,000 in the encouragement of the
mining industry in the r>ast few years.
Since 1851 the colony of Victoria- has pro
duced nearly one and a quarter billion dollars
worm of gold, within $300,000,000 or so of
California.* production. Tne product for 1896
wae Â£3.220,348, a little less than California's
pro-uct. Tne increase has been steady since
low-water mark was reached in 1891.
Victoria is far ahead of any of the other colo
nies as a producer as California is of rival
States and provinces, and like California has
newly discovered fields, undeveloped districts
and lodes rich at great depths. So while Vic
loria Keeps up and increases its total product
by reason of its large producers and its con
siderable development, it is suffering a loss of
population by reason of the dazzling reports
from rival regions, with their mad rushes aud
the magic of a boom.
To return to the less excltin* operations of
the California Mining Bureau, it may ba stated
tuat Mr. Cooper has decided to publish by
counties the mining map, the planning of
which was announced last week. The field
deputies will locate existing mines of all sorts
i on county maps, together with water power,
| p. ants, etc.
The Sierra Railroad from Oakdale through
the mining regions of Amador and Mar
ipoÂ«a countien, which Prince Poniatowski
and associates have begun to build, ii a signifi
cant and encouraningenterprise. The mining
regions of Calitornia have Buffered tremen
dously through lack of transportation facili
ties, find one reason of it has been the
absence of competing lines iv the ''tate
Competition has started the trunk
lines of the Northwest into prompt
prompt racing to the new British Columbia
districts, and the presence of the Valley road
and the coming of other rival trunk lines will
hasten the building of feeders to many mining
district*.
During the past winter the mining regions a
few miles from railroad stations have been
awaiting everywhere the opportunity to haul
in mining mxemnery and supplies, upon
which developm nt of mines or operation of
them ha< depended. The western slope of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains has been dotted
from MarfpoÂ»ato Plumas County with stamp
mill*, bollerf, engines, electrical apparatus
water pipe, ana mining appliances and supl
plies of every description, which, when the
rains and snows of early winter came were en
route to mines. The bad mountain roa Is at
once became next to impassable, and these
materials for activity re.ted to await the dry
roads of spring. y
Many mines shut down because fuel could
not be economically transported.
The Sierra Pacific wil. make the director of
the mint write the bigger figures in statin
thgoll production ad so will every one of
the needed brauch lines into the mining
Mr. Harris ia a little too modest to say that
he was chosen to conduce and referee these
matches. We all know what * labor ol love it
is; at the same time it needs a person thor
oughly conversant with the laws, and no bet
ter man could be selected.
AnsWers to Queries.
One of the members of the Vallejo Whist
Club asks the following question:
Holding ace. 9. 7. 0, 5 of trumps, your part
ner leads trumps, you win wÂ»th the ace, wou d
you return ihe six or five?
Answer-We think the correct clay would
be after winning witn ace to return the low
est. You cannot show number or the posses
sion of five trumps originally to a certainty by
the returu of a y one car.l ; from such a hold
ing the drop will no doubt mark every remain
ing trump.
WHAT IS A PIANO HAND?
A piano haud is one easily played and which
in a duplicate match would probably produce
the same score at every table.â From "Whist
of To-Day."
We have an Inquiry from Sunol, asking
"What is the best textbook on whist?"
This question we cannot answer. As near
as we are able to find out there are
about 500 different books published on
the game, and they are no doubt all gocd
If our correspondent wants to be right up to
date subscriDe for "Whist,- a monthly journal
published in Milwaukee. Wis., costing $1 a
year. Sample copies furnished by The Call
Whistlets.

week we sent out over four hundred. The
first edition is nearly exhausted. They are
sent out free; they cannot be purchased.
Mrs. I>. W. Guptill, vice-president of theTrist

SENT II PETITION
TO HUNTINGTON
The People of Wrights
Want Broad - Gauge
Facilities.
Ask to Have a Third Rail Lai
From Los Gatos to That
Point
Efforts are being made by the people of
Wriehts, the station Deyond Los Gato.Â«,
on the narrow-gauge line to Santa Cruz,
to have the Southern Pucific extend to
them the iaclities of a broad-gauze line,
by laying a third rail from Los Gatos to
that point.
Wright! is the center of a prosperous
fruit and grape growing country, and of
late years has made great strides as a
shipping point. All its products now go
over tb9 narrow-eauge line and must be
transhipped at San Joie or some other
point where the narrow-gauge and broad
gauge roads touch a common point.
This makes such shipments not only
more expensive, but more or less endan
gers the quality of the goods shipped, par
ticularly when they comprise, as they do
largely, green fruits.
It is only a iew years since the third
rail was laid batween San Jose and L>s
Gatoft, but the results have ampiy demon
strated the wisdom of the improvement.
Induced partly by this favombl* outcome
and partly by the advance that has been
made in tne settlement of the country
immediately about Wrights, the res dents
of that section have addressed a petition
to ihe Southern Pacific ask ng for the
same transportation Jucilities that its
neighboring town enjoys.
The petition is now in the hands of C.
P. Huntlngton, ihe president of the rail
road corporation, but has not yet been
considered by the directors of the com
jmny, _
President Huntington was asked about
ihe matter yesterday, and stated that his
attention had not b.-en particularly culled
to the petition.
"Will the petition of the Wright people
be printed ?" I.c was aske I.
'That I cannot say. The matter has
not yet been taken up," he replied.
"When it is considered our decision will
depuid upon what amount of traffic we
get or may expect from that point."
About the proposition to convert the
entire length of the narrow-gauge road
from the mole on the other side of tlie
kav to Santa Cruz, as is also being urged
l>v the people alon* the line, President
Huntington was not at nil encouraging.
He saia the matter had not even been
considered. Another official of the com
pany stated that there was not enough
truffi'j to warrant the expense of â¢neb a
project at itie pieient time.
CADETS TO HAVE
A CRUCIAL TEST
League of the Cross Mem
bers in a Big Com
pstitive Drill.
Most E ficient Companies Wili
Contest or the Mont
gomery Medal.
Only Four Can Take Part on the 29 h
Inst.â His'ory of the Organi-
Zdt on
The crucial test to determine which four
of th* twelve companies of ifae League of
the Cross Cadets of this City and Oakland
will contest in the big competitive drill at
Mechanics' Pavilion on tne evening of
Thursday, the 29tli inst., takes place to
day at the Pavilion. It will be in the
nature of a tryout to select tbe most com
petent companies to contest for tbe
splendid "Montgomery medal," a golden
emblem stuided with diamonds, pre
sented by Rev. Peter C. Yorke. and now
held by Company G, Captain Power.
Captains Marshall, E,-gert and Filmer
of the First Infantry Regiment, N. G. C.
will judge of the merits of the various
companies, and the result will not be
known until the night of the big drill, in
order that all may be kept in the h.ghest
state of discipline until that time.
Colonel Commanding William P. Sulli
van Jr., who deserves much credit for the
hieh state cf efficiency into which he has
worked the cadets, will oversee to-day 'a
j drill.
The history of tbe organization is an in-
I teresting one, showin . as it doe?, what
persiMHiit and well-directed effort will ac
complish.
The League of the Cross bad been or
gan. 7.Â».i for some time, when, 111 the fall
of l â *!â¢.;, the iJea of lorming companies of j
cacieis ::i the various branches was sug- I
gested to the executive committee by (MM
of Us members. The suggestion met with
but little opposition, and this was caused
by a feeling on the part ot some that it j
would oe an undertaking of considerable
magnitude to properly uniform and equio j
sucii an organization as was propose 1. Of
the propriety vi the feature, and of the
benefit which woula rtotllt to the League
of toe Cross and to the cause of temper- '
anc through it, no one who heard the
suggestion, had any doubt..
The Right Rev. George Montgomery, i
then spiritual director of the league, con
suited with Colonel William P. Suiivan j
Jr. about tbe matter, and the colonel
promise I him bis active co-operation in
the work.
At a meeting of the officers of the
junior branches, held at tbo cathedral in
October, 1893, the announcement was
made that cadets were 10 1 c organized in
the league. The Cathedral branch alone
was represented at the lirsi meeting and
the prospect ot forming c.idet ompanirr,
was siot very encouraging. Thecommutee, j
however, nctine on the a<tvice of B.shop â 
Montgomery and Colonel Sullivm, called I
another meeting in January, 18J4. In the j
interim wor* was quietly carried on, with
what success may ue concluded from, he
fact that on January 7, 1894, the board ol
otlit- -rs of the league was organized.
Tne Cathedral branch, being composed
of the greater number ot members, re- j
ceived the title Company A, St. Cbaries
hinnch was ue^nated as Company B, St. !
Patrick's Company C, Sacred Heart Com- i
pai:y D and St. Francis Company E.
On February 26, 1894, the tirst sieps to
ward a permanent organization were
made. Company A was mustered into
the First Regiment, L. C. C, by Colonel
Sullivan. Then followed the other com
panies in rapid succession. Company B,
St. Chnries Parish, March 5, 1894; Com
pany 0, bt Patrick's, March 11. 1894;
Company D. Sacred Heart, March 30, l.v 4;
Company E, St. James. April 10, 18W;
Cotnpanv F, St. Theresa's, May 15, 1>94;
Company 6, St. Brigiu's, June 8, 1894;
Company H, St. Brendan's, July 17, 1793;
Company I. St. Peter's, December 10,
1894; Company X, S . Paul's, Muy 17,
I860; Company L, Mission Do ores, May
31, 189">; Company M, St. Franch, March
Ti, 18JG.
Com tmny C was dropped on September
19, IHXi, while Company F, being unable
to make nteeh proeresÂ«, was dropped in 1
the lutier part of 1894. Tnese places were I
quickly tihed. Two companies were started
in Oakland, at St. Francis de Sales Church !
and St. Patrick's. They were mustered 111
re-ipertively, as Company N, on October
13. 1897. and as Company F, on October 10, I
1897. Not only has the reeimem the full
complement of twelve companies, but it
ulso has an average of fifty uniformed I
members in each one.
Besides the companies there is a band
of forty amateur musicians, ana among
them are some of tne linest of that class in
this City. Tneir first appearancp will be

third annual competitive drill. There is
also Â« field band composed of twenty-four
drummers ana n like number of tilers.
Tne Montgomery trophy, wnich is to be
competed for, is at present in possession
of Company G of St. Brigld s Paii-h,
and "vns presented to the regiment in
April. 1895.
Tne trophy is n massive gold medal,
studded ir.lli diamonds, hnd iÂ« pendent
tror.i a bar of gold Wbicb bears upon it tip
name of the 1 rophy. The center of the
medal proper is embellished with a re
markaby correct likeness o: Bishop Mont
gomery, in ivory, which is set into the
gold of the medal. It is a magnificent
specimen of the designer's art, and apart
from Hie honor of wearing ihe trophy,
which attaches to it by reason of its name
ana by reason ol being won by only ono
company out of the many, it is well worth
the labor of a hard competition on : ccount
of its great beauty.
The conditions upon which it is to be
competed for annually are as follows:
Every uniformed company in the regi
ment is entitled to compete. The decision
of the question oi wh.ch company is en
titled to the trophy is to be given by
three impartial judges, and there i3 no
appeal from their decision. Any company
winning the trophy or three consecutive
years becomes us owner absolutely, and
it will not, in such event, be any longer a
subject of competition.
At the first competitive drill for this
troohy, held in May, 1895, it was won by
Company C of St. Patrick's p iri-h, Cap
tain Edw. Fitzgerald. At <he second
drill, in April, 189 G. Company G, com
manded by Captain E. J. Power, carried
off the trophy.
On the evening of the drill, April 29,
1897, the League of the Cross Cadets band
will, un.ler the direction and leaderthip
of Julius L. Weyand. give a short con
cert, fit which, for the first time, the public
will have an orportunity of hearing the

â¢ CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, tab, April 17.â May wheat to-day
closed at 733ic, a cean advance of *YsC since
Thurslay. Tuis advance on short Saturday ses
sion is attended with much excitement, ana the
session throughout was as lively a one as has
been witnessed in many month*. Kvery one
wanted to buy wheat, but tnere was little for sale.
There are several reasons for the sudden frirht of
shorts. The more immediate cause was a report
from New York that wheat went up 3 cents a
bushel tuere anil at Antwerp and Berlin about 2
cents.
Provisions were decidedly higher and more
active. Toe principal factors were a sharp ad
vance in wheat and liberal baying. Casa trade
however, is unimproved. *

BICYCLES POa THE INSAITE.
The Wheel Rocom mended for Patients
at Several State Asylums.
One of the most notable instances of the
efficacy of the bicycle as a remedy- for in
sanity, says the Chicago Chronicle, is
found at the Michigan state Asylum for
the Insane at Ealamazoo. The patients
at this asylum take, daily rides on the
w heel and parties of from five to eight
lunatics in charge of two attendants are
likely to be met with on any of the coun
try roads running out of the city. To the
uninitiated it would seem odd, indeed, that
the regulation country highway should be
chosen for the wheeling parties in prefer
ence to the well-kept roads of tbe town.
There is a reason, however, and a very
good one it is, too. The tougher the road
the more necessary does it become for the
lunatic cyclist to uevote a great deal of at
tention to hi- machine. The result is that
white riding In this way he has no oppor
tunity to thinK of ' the peculiar mania
which may afflict him, and his mind takes
on a healthier tone, his thoughts are those
of a man with an unclouded brain, and he
become, for the time being, practically
sane. . ;. s
The Kalamazoo doctors say that they
have never yet heard of a course of treat
ment which causes self-Jorgeiiuiiu-ss in a
degree even approaching that produced
by the use 01 the bicycle. Instead of
moping in the asylum or taking forced
exercise about tue grounds' the lunatics
who are considered tit subjects lor instruc
tion on the wheel are taken every week
I from the Kalamazoo asylum on < the
wheels to Long Luke, ten miles distant,
or to one of the chain of smaller lakes not
so far from the asylum. A plentiful
lunch is taken along, and the occasion be
comes a veritable picnic. '*.-
Of course, on trips of this kind some
tires'are bound to be punctured, the gear
ing is sure to get out 1 of order and 1 more
j or less other mechanical difficulties en
countered. The "result of all mi* is that
the lunatic has no time at all to become*
melancholy. The exercise, the fresh air,
the unwonted cause for thoughtfulne;s on
new subjects, all contribute toward wooing
I the return of reason. â ""..'
The State Asylum for the Insane at
Middieiown.-N. V., is another institution
that considers the bicycle a means to ren
der help to the insane. The wheel has"
beeVusad at this asylum for some months
with the most, gratify inj;re.siij;s. It is
found that ii promotes doc;i:ty among
tne patients, who en joy, the excursions,
and invariably induces a far healthier
condition of the mind. It also acts cs an
incentive toward good behavior on the
part of others, w..0 have not been per
mitted to ride, the change in their atti
tudes being brought about by the ?ight of
the keen- enjoyment which the lunatic
riders seem to take in riding. . . .
Dr. rjelden H. Talcott, medical superin
tendent of this asylum, is an enthusiast
regarding the wheel as a beneht to per
sons of unsound mind. "It is, in my
estimation," he said, "beyond question
that the bicycle' will eventually become a
permanent institution in every insane
asylum. There is no doubt whatever that
the tendency of cycling by insane persons
is toward the restoration of reason.
"Of course I do not mean to say that
every crazy person should be permitted to
ride a wheel. As & matter of fact, cycling
sbould only be allowed among that class
of patients in an asylum known as tue
convalescent, and others whose mania is
not of a violent nature. , I venture to pre
dict that within five years mere will no
be found a medical man with knowledge
of insanity and insane people who does
not favor wheeling as a curative process."

GOLDEN LURE OF

The New Rush, the Murder
Story and *' Pana

Goldsmith May Ccme Back to
His Sweetheart With God
From Death Valley.
The Latest Mining Excitement Is
Am d the Terrors cf the Utter
most Parts of tb.3 Desert.
Julius Goldsmith may yet come back
from the far wastes of the Mojave Desert
Eurros Strike It Rich in a Typic al Prospector's Home in the Desert*
to his family and sweetheart here in San
Â¥ ran cisco, for yesterday the still uncer
tain reports from Randsburg made fiction
of the story that Goldsmith and two
other prosDectors had been murdered in
the Panamint country by "Panaiuint
Tom," a renegade Piute Indian, who has
long been one of the desert's terrors.
However the murder story turns out, it
points to one of I c most picturesque and
romantic phases of the hunt for gold,
which tills so big a place in the present
history of California.
The Panamint range, which forms the
western wall of Death Valley, is the scene
of the latest cold excitement. West of the
range is Panamint Valley and the long
piretch of desolation winch reaches to
Randsburg and on to Mojave.
The new Panamint district is on both |

Home of ** Panamint Tom/
sides of the boundary between Inyo and
San Bernardino counties, thirty or forty
miles west of the State line and from 100
to 150 miles from anywhere on any side.
It is in the very depths of tne desert and
may be said to be in the center of the field
of bleaching bones, the theater of horrors
which the desert has been for a genera
tion.
Young Goldsmith is typical of a large
part of the men who are counting on the
Panamint Mountains for riches. He waa
raised in the City and a year ago he was
engaged to be married. With tliis spur
for bis effort he went to Kandsburg last
fall to find a gold mine and make enough
to buy a home here in the Oty. He has
not found tbe mine and a few weeks ago

wrong ; the blood is poor; it lacks the pure
nourishing qualities which are needed to
vitalize and invigorate the body. In. this

of pure, rich, red blood.
You can't have sparkling eyes, red ripe
lips, a clear rosy complexion and a graceful
symmetrical figure while the blood remains
impure and impoverished. What is needed
is Dr. Pieice's Golden Medical Discovery to
cleanse foul humors out of the blood, and
help the assimilative organism to enrich the
circulation with an abundance of healthy
red corpuscles, creating fresh color and firm,
wholesome flesh. All this is attractiveness,

he joined the march to the |Panamint
district, going to the uttermost parts of
a desolate waste in search of a wedding
and a home in :&e City.
"Panamint Tom," who fa the murderer
in this new story, seems to be a remark
able California character. From Rands
burg he is credited with twenty-one pros
pectors to date, but a mining engineer
who chased "Panamint Tom" out of camp
with a club last summer thinks it Is not
more than fourteen or fifteen.
Tom is a big, strapping, vicious, cun
ning, good-for-nothing renegade Piute
Indian, who for some reason has k**pt
away from the Piute reservation in Ne
vada for fifteen or twenty years.
On the west side of the Panaraint range
is a bij; canyon several miles long with the
satirical name "Pleasant" Canyon. It
reaches up to the top of the range. At the
lower cud of the canyon is Postolhce
Springs. This is about the center of the
Panamint dis;r;ct.
In a gulch on one side of this canyon
Panamini Tom lives in^i wickiup by a
little spring, and he rustles an existence
In a predatory and occasionally a bloody
way. According to the engineer referred
to, O. Newhouse, expert for E. A. Wiltsee,
and other sources of information, Tom
levies tribute on every prospector who
comes into the country, on the theory
that the whole country is his because he
was there first. He is an industrious thiel
and raids every camp at every oppor
tunity. Another resource is to run bur
ros off into a blind gulch at night and
get a few dollars for finding them.
He carries a big knife in his shirt and
threatens every locator of a claim. Most
men are afraid of .him, and \tttj give him
grub, whisky and occasionally mouev, to
i.et along pepwably with him. Now and
then he does a job of packing.
The accompanying p : ctures are from
photographs taken by Mr. Newhouse last
fall. One shows a miner's camp in me
desert. No shelter was needed for the hoi
night, and the bunk made of a few boards
was set up at the base of a cliff. A sheet
iron stove, a water-keg and a few unpro
tected boxes for grab make up the iurni
ture.
But there is gold in the Tana mint
country, and after the<e years of deatli
and adventure they an beginning to get
it out. Several hundred will return
weary and penniless for every one tha:
strikes it. though fifteen years ago a pros
pector, who had been battling with the
desert, brought in rich samples from this
rpgion, and contracted to sell his mine to
William Parke oi I'arke <fc Lacy.
He went back for more samples before
Parke was to senn an expert to muke an
examination, and died an unknown death
wiih a tortuue in his grasp at last. He
was never heard of again, and the mine
was lost to await another discoverer.
So far thÂ» Ptnamint district is in the
early stage of big stories and no develop
ment There is plenty of ore of so low a
grade that no capitalist would buy a
claim. Peihaps rich strikes have been
and will be made, but it is all "perhaps"
to date. *
GIRLS WHO MEAN BUSINESS.
Kight of Them, Seeking Employment,
Write to Governor JBudd.
The following interesting letter, as in
dicative of the lighi in which this State is
regarded in the East, was recently le
ceived by Governor Budd and referred by
him to J. A. Filcher, secretary of the
State Board of Trade:
35 Sheafe Street, Maplewood. Mass.. )
April 10, 1897 j
To the Governor of California, United States of
Amo icoâ Dear Sir: Owing to the extreme
dullness" oi trade here in the East we, a club
oi young, industrious working girls number
inc eight persons, have decided to go West.
We thought it a very pood idea to seek In
formation from some well-informed person
who would Eivc the matter tuli consideration.
We would like to know the cny or town where
we would be likely to get good work. We also
would like to know what business is profitable
tv women.
We can all furnish the best of references
from here. We are all good sewers and ah
have trades. Hoping; to hear from you soon,
as we are very earnest in the undertaking, we
remain, your humble servants.
Address May McLaughlla.
In reply. Secretary Filcber informed
the young ladies that if they were witting
to run the risks of coming to California he
would see what could be done for tuÂ«m.
So ,t is probable that in tha near future
the population of tbe Golden State will be
enriched by the addition of eight first

MRS. E. L. PHILLIPS
HAS TWO HUSBANDS
Sudden Attachment for the
First Strangely De
veloped.
Gold From South Africa Causes
a Revolution in Divorce
Litigation.
Failure to Eater Judgment May Cause
a Negligent Husband to Lose
Half His Fortune.
Mrs. Eva L. Phillips has won a victory
in her attempt to cleave to her million
aire husband. According to the decision
of Judge Seawell she is stiil his wife, and
she wants half his property.
In 1894 Mrs. Phillips grew weary of her
husband's neglect and sued for a divorce
on the ground of desertion. She knew he
had gone to the South African gold fields,
but did not know that lie bad 'Struck it
rich" in partnership with fiarnsto,
Rhodes and Hammond, and that his
fortune was estimated at Â£300,0^0 in Eng
lish money.
Mr. Phillips showed that he had not
entirely forgotten his wife, for be managed
to let ber hear news from President
Kruger's realm quite frequently, and
these reports were uniformly to the effect
mat he, the busband, was still pursued
by hard luck.
Taking this view of the circumstances,
and thinking that her husband was not
worth keeping, Mr*. Phillips told her
tronbles to the court and was granted a
decree of divorce.
J.y some stranee omission on the part of
Mn.' Jfhillips, principally the failure to
pay the legal fees, the judgment in this
case was never emered, and no judgment
roll was made up. This omission teems
now to be the matter on which she may
depend for a share of her husband's
fortune.
That Mrs. Phillips had no thought of
this phHse of tho case, and that she
deemed herself lawfully divorced is indi
cated by the fact that she soon afterward
married Walter Bradford of this City. He
did not prove a congenial mate and has
sued for a divorce, but this action need
not bo tried since Mrs. Phillips, it now ap
i>ears, had a busband when she married
Bradford, and that marriage may Lj an
nulled.
Mrs. Phillips may technically be con
sidered guilty of bisamv, but it woul.l be
difficult to get a jury that would convict
her since she would piead that she acted
in good faith, and did not know that the
entry of judgment .ras necessary to com
plete the transaction.
In her case it appears that ignorance of
the law has been a source of good fortune
Last December Mrs. Phillips heard that
her first husband had returned to the
United States with all of his pockets full
of money, and incidentally learned that
she might re-establish her claim to him if
she could get r;d of her first suit for di
vorce. She employed a lawyer to sÂ«e
what could be done, and he moved to set
aside tbe decree of divorce and to dismiss
the suit, on the ground that he deceived
h#r in regard to the community property

and alleging that the South African for
tune grew out of money accumulated dur
ine their marriage.
Before that application could be heard
and determined Ptulhps was informed of
his wife's movements and secured a stay
of proceeding?, rie was courting a pretty
girl in Minnesota and was desirous of
having his wife's divorce declared valid,
so he moved to have the judgment of di
vorce entered nunc pro tune as of Jan
uary 2, 1891 He was willing to advance
the fees and would take the chance of col
lecting Irom Mrs. Phillips-Bradford.
Juilge Seawell held tiie case under con
sideration for nearly three months, and,
afterexaminine the law. denied Phillips'
motion and decided that if Phillips had a
right to move to enter judgment nunc
pro tune in his opinion Mrs. Phillips had
equal rinnt to move to vacate judgment.
If the motion to Vacate judgment be
granted, as the law allows, then the
plaint ff has a legal right to dismiss the
action, because the defendant did not rile
an answer demanding affirmative relief
by way of cross-complaint, nor in any
other way. .
It follows that MtP. Phillips' suit for
divorce must be dismissed, so she is still
his wife, the same as if the action had not
been begun, and Millionaire Phillips must
make terms wi:h his original wife before
he can marry the pretty girl in Minnesota.
In the meantime he has himself brought
suit for divorce, and the scene of further
litigation touching the relations of this
interesting family will be transferred to
the couits of Minneapolis.
BEEF EXPORTS.
Certificates of Iniipection Will Not Bo
Krq nired at 1 his Port.
The Secretary of the Treasury has
rendered a decision stating that beef ex
tracts, beef juices, beef peptones and
Bimilar preparations may be exported
without the certificate of "inspection re
quired by law. He has also rendered a
decision to the effect that the law re
quiring inspection of beef exported ap
plies only to beef used for human food,
and that meat meal, cracklings, and other
animal products used for fertilizers or
lood for an mals do not come under the
provisions of the law requiring the in
spection of beef exported.
It has been stated already in The Call
that that part of the law Lad been sus
pended so far as it related to exports to
all except European ports. Until the
operation of the law shall have been ex
tended to all ports there will not be much
inspection done at the port of San Fran
cisco, becnuse little or no beef food
trod nets are shipped from this place to
Europe.

Annie McCarthy, otherwise Sister Claire,
and the Girls 1 Directory Orphan Asylum.
The complaint alleges that prior to
January 24, 1894, thert existed in this City
an orpnau asyium and institution lor
abandoned children, known as the Girls'
Directory Orphan A^yium; that said in
stitut on was conducted by a society
whose members consisted uf Brid<:et
Mines, Harrietta Lvnian, Bridget Ferry,
H nnah Wall and Annie McCarthy ; that
said persons formed an independent
branch of tite Sisters of the Catholic
Order of St. Francis, but remained an in
dependent society by themselves, free
from the control nr interference of tee
Archbishop of San Francisco or any other
ecclesiastical authority; that said five
members went through the ceremony of
obtaining a cord and scapular from a
Franciscan priest of the Roman Catholic
church in San Francisco, and after going
through said ceremony did thereupon
assume a certain habit or robe and bonnet
st.eh as Catholic nuns usually wear.
This society, the complaint says, en
gaged publicly in the work of maintain
ing orphans and rescuing abandoned chil
dren, and solicited and received con
tributions an>i help from the corumunitv
as well as from the State of Caliloruia;
that by their joint efforts larjre and valua
ble assets were accumulated, consisting
principally of the land at the northwest
corner of Buena Vista and Central ave
nues in this City, together with the im
provements thereon; but that the title to
said property was taken in the name of
Bridget Mines in trust lor the society and
was purchased solely by funds owned by
the society.
In 1894 the society was incorporated
with the live original members as direc
tors. Thereafter Yvonne Griffith and
Alma Schuman were admitted as mem
bers ot toe corporation.
Bridget Mines is and has been the presi
dent of the corporation, and the com
plaint charges that she has refused to give
a title of the property to the society,
but that she has threatened to dispose of
it by deed or will to some one not a mem
