Greece Protests Against the
Attempt to Coerce

INTERNATIONAL LAW VIOLATED
Proposed Expulsion of Greeks From Crete
Not Warranted â Situation on the
Frontier Becomes More
Serious.
ATHENS, Greece, March 10. -The j
Oreek Government has instructed its rep- i
resentatives abroad to protest against the !
expulsion of Greek subjects from Canea as
an arbitrary violation on the part of the i
powers of international law.
LONDON, En<+., March 10.â The entire â 
staff of employes at the Devonport dock- J
yards, numbering 5000, has been ordered i
to work overtime for the purpose of hast- I
ening the completion of the fitting out of |
vessels upon which they are engaged. :
The order is believed to have been issued
in view of the cri?is which has arisen over
the Cretan question.
The Daily Chronicle will publish a dis
patch to-morrow from Athens saying that
Greece has 60,000 troops on the frontier
and that the Turkish and Greek outposts
are very close together in places. For in- j
stance, at Arta the Turks hold one end of '
a bridge and the Greeks the other. A !
Greek general, recently, while inspecting j
ttJ frontier, accidentally entered Turkish j
territory and was captured by the Otto- j
man patriots, brtt was eventually rescued !
by his troops. The situation on the fron- i
tier, it is said, is a dangerous one ar.d l:t- ,
tie wonld be required to set the country !
The Daily News to-morrow will pub
lish a dispatch from Canea saving that |
tne British, French and Italian admirals!
landed this afternoon and held a confer- j
ence with the insurgent leaders at Akro- j
tiri. They expressed regret thai they al- j
lowed the Turkish ships to fire upon the I
insurgents during the previous day's
fighting, believing then tbat the insur
gents were the aggressors. Since then,
they said, they had learned that it was .
the Bashi-Bazouks who provoked the |
conflict.
In the course of the interview, the dis
patch adds, the Cretans stated that they i
had not received the admiral's warning |
previous to the bombardment of February '
21, and that they were unaware also of !
the promise of autonomy for t.'rete, which !
communications were intrusted to Com
mander Reneicke of the Greek warship
Hydra.
The News, in commenting on this dis
patch, will suggest that the communica
tions intrusted to Commander Reneicke
were delivered in the wrong quarter.
The Standard to-morrow will publish a
dispatch from Canea saying that it is
rumored there that the Greek army of
occupation under command of Colonel
Vassos is short of provisions, its supplies
of eatables consisting only of biscuits and
oranges.
The dispatch also says that the admi
rals of the foreign warships have warned ;
the commander at Canea that if the Bashi- !
PazouKs again provoke the insurgents to
an encounter their village will be bom- j
barded by the warships, and moreover,
that no band of Bashi-Bazouks will here-
be allowed to enter Canea, or to sally
oat into the interior.
To-morrow the Standard will publish an
Athens dispatch saying that the summon
ing of the Greek reserves for service has
I compelled several large commercial houses
k to close tbeir doors. Numbers of families
â  aye been left without supporters, and the
Entire social life of the country is at s
standstill.
The Times will to-morrow publish a dis
patch from Athens saying that tbe firing
at Hierapetra yesterday and the expulsion
Of M. Baraklis, the Greek Vice-Consul at
Canea, has rearonsed the war fever there.
The Times will also publish a dispatch
from Canea saying that the situation at
Hierapetra is one of great anxiety. The
insurgents are well supplied with guns,

Moslem* Grafful to England for Her
Ready A.*nl%tanee.
LONDON, Eng., March 10.â The Daily
News will to-morrow publish a dispatch
from Canea saying that the Mussulmans
who have been besieged at Kandamos and
who have arrived at Canea were conveyed
thither on board the Italian transport
Trinicia, and that another vessel is ex
pected to arrive shortly with more refu
gees. The force which relieved the be
leagured inhabitants at Kandamos re
leased eleven soldiers who were imprisoned
in the blockhouse. The arrival of the
trensport with her load of refugees has
created a great impression in Canea. One
of the chief Beys says it is impossible to
express the gratitude of the Moslems
toward Great Britain.
The News correspondent relates the
story of the rescue of the beleaguered in
habitants at Kandamos. His account says
the utmost credit is due to Sir A. Biiiotti,
the British Consul at Canea, who man
aged the entire affair personally. With
out his aid the people could not "hay*
escaped. â  ; â¢ ',
The place was surrounded by JWO
' Cretans, who kept up a continuous
| fusillade, which some times was replied to
ova sight fire. Consul Biliotti entered
I the town and remained until nightfall,
I when, having become convinced of the
j absolute necessity of employing a force of
i Europeans to effect the release of the be
! leaguered ones, he returned to Selino,
from which place he started on his return
to Kandamos with a force of 250 Briiiah,
100 French, 100 Austrians, 150 Russians
! and 55 Italians, with four guns. This
j force was commanded by the captain of
the British warship Rodney.
Upon arriving at Kandamos the troops
i remained on the outskirts while the (Jon-
I sul entered the town to arrange for the
i sortie. Some delay occurred, owing to a
'' lack of beasts of burden. The Cretans had
i ceased their firing and consented that the
'â  Moslem soldiers should retain their arms,
but when the latter emerged and a start
was made for Selino a scene of the wildest
confusion and one of great danger took
place.
The horde of Cretan insurgents sur
rounded the refugees and everywhere a
gap occurred in the escort would dash in
and tear the weapons from the Bashi-
Bazouks and match the bundles which
many of tbe women and children carried.
It was with the utmost difficulty that the
Moslems wera prevented from firing on
the insurgents and thus bringing about a
horrible slaugnter. During the confusion
one girl was kidnaped by the Cretans.
The insurgents followed the refugees,
pressing in upon their column as far as
Spaniako, where there is a gorge, which
was blocked by the escort after the refu
gees had passed. This prevented the Cre
tans from advancing further. The ern
barcation on board tha Trinicia began at
5 o'clock in the evening and ended at 9
o'clock.
After sunset the Cretans at Sehno began
to make hostile demonstrations against
the Moslems. With a view to putting a
stop to their manifestation the warships
tired several rifle shots into the air and
also fired one of their guns.
Tbe Governor of Kandamos says that
when the people in the town were relieved
by Europeans there was only seven boxes
of rifle cartridges left, and that the gun
ammunition had become completely ex
hausted. There was neither bread nor
rice in the town, but there was a plentiful
supply of meat. Had there been a suf
ticient amount of bread and ammunition

the Governor declares the lnnamtants ana
the garrison would have been abie to re
sist the insurgents for a year.
When the refugees boarded thu trans
port their arms were removed to the Rod
; ney. The correspondent says the refugee
are rapidly embarking at Canea and the
Trinioia will return to Selimo. A few
have houses left, but a majority of them
are utterly ruined and many have been
made invalids. During the passage of the
transport from Seiiuo to Canea a child was
born on board.
The rabble at Selino, the reporter sny?,
was very trouolesome, and, despite the
fact that the sailors had been on the
march for twelve hours, they were com
pelled to remain under arms all night in \
order to keep the rabble out of the town
and to protect the embarking refugees.
They were obliged on several occasions to
tire on the insurgents, bo menacing were
their actions. When the shin left Selfno
I it was feared that a general attack would
i be made upon that ilace.

VVHI.IV OPIXJOJS TRIUMPHS.
France Serves Notice That It Cannot
More Agnintt (Zrerc**
NEW YORK, N. V., March 11.â A spec
ial cable dispatch to the Sun from London
says: The danger of war in the East has
decidedly diminished for the time being.
The reason is not to be found in the reply
of Greece to the ultimatum of the powers.
Russia, Germany and Austria interpret
this refusal to comply with the terms of
the"identical note, and they are not in
favor of an Immediate resort to the co
ercion which was threatened. The situa
tion has been completely changed, how
-1 ever, by the new power â namely, public
opinion in Western Europe.
The French Government has been com
pelled to give notice, reluctantly, to its
Russian ally tbat it cannot join it in any
vindictive or severe measures against
Greece while public opinion in France re
mains as it is now.
Lord Salisbury would gladly give a simi
lar notice in behalf of Great Britain, but it
would be received only with suspicion
and resentment. It is quite different a-.
regards France. Russia has ample as
surance that M. Hanotaux and his col
leagues would be glad to join in the Rus
sian policy if it was in their power to do
so, but they dare not in the face of the
opposition of Parliament and of the masses
of the French people.
The most they can do is to request de
lay until an opportunity is given to change
or amend the popular mind. Great efforts
are to be made in this direction between
now and Saturday next, when the ques
tion will be debated in the French Cham
ber. It is doubtful if a safe majority in
favor of .severe measures against Greece
can be assured.
In fact every day's delay is now of the
greatest advantage to Greece, whose clev
erly designed answer to the demands of
the powers is disarming her enemies in
at least three nations. The indications
grow stronger that it will no longer be

Should De Young B? Sent to Italy,
Many Phces Will Be Lost to
California.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 10.âSen
aior Perkins went to the White House to
day with a big batch of recommendations
for the appointment of Californians to
foreign missions and consular positions.
"You don't expect me to appoint all
those men, do you?" said President Mc-
Kinlev.
"Well, I don't know," returned the
Senator. "I'd like to have you appoint
as many as you can. They are all good
men."
"How many places in the consular ser
vicp do you consider your State entitled
to?"
"I should think we ought to pull out
five or six good ones."
"Well," retorted the President, "Â»up
posa you take those papers away with you
and after consulting on that basis with
your delegation pick out five or six of the
best men and all join in recommending
them. There is plenty of time."
"It would be difficult to make a selec
tion," suggested the Senator.
"Not so difficult for you as for me," re
turred the President; "you know the
men and I don't."
"1 mean that it would be embarrassing
for me to indicate a preference In many
cases."
"Do you want me to assume that crn
barrassment? lam willing to share the
responsibility, but I cannot make any ap
pointments from your State unless you
select the men. You must get together,
too. I don't propose to settle any contro
versies."
That is the sort of talk the Presi
dent gives to nearly all the Congressmen
who visit him, and as a consequence the
delegations from the Beveral States will
hold meetings to decide between the
claims of contending constituents. They
.are. pretty well uonvinced that they will
not be able vc ?Â«curf> tppointments v.pon
upon their indiviiiuai influence and must
act together for the welfare of their party.
The Star this evening says: "There is a
feeling of confidence among the Califor
nia people to-day that Colonel Harrison
Gray Otis will receive the appointment of
Assistant Secretary of War. If the ap
pointment is made the California men
think they wilt not pet much more in the
shape of departmental positions. With
Secretary McKenna and Colonel Otis their
exDectations would be about tilled.
"It is felt that if M. H. de Young gets
the Embas?adorship abroad which he
wants, the other candidates for forelen
Â«ppointments will not stand much chance.
If De Young fails in the appointment,
then a number of places will go to the
State. The friends of Speaker Coombs of
the State Lesislature regard his chances
for going to Japan as good. The fiiends
of Judge Dudley, who wants to go to
Hawaii, think he stands a good chance."
Senator McÃride of Oregon doubts the
report that ex-Senator John H. Mitchell
is a candidate for appointment as United
States Circuit Judge, to succeed McKenna,
inasmuch as Mitchell has not advised him
of his candidacy.
A gentleman of some fame as a writer,
who might claim a residence in any of
three Stati s and who hns been a warm
personal friend of the President, askeJ to
be considered a candidate for an attrac
tive foreign mission.
"I have not brought any papers," he
said, "for you know me as well as any
body and can judee as accurately of my
fitness as all the Senators and Representa
tives and politicians in the country. Still,
if it is necessary I will get some letters."
"I would do so if I were you," observed
the President quietly.
"From whoru do you suggest?"
"From the Senators and Representatives
of your State."
"I doubt if I could get either one of the
Senators," was the reply, "but I can get
the Representatives."
"Better get the Senators, too, if you
can," remarked the President, and be
turned to another visitor.
Some of the office-seekers are beginning
to vo home; others are arriving by every
train. Those who came before the 4th
have found very little encouragement to
remain. They have discovered to their
chazrin that most of the offices are nailed
down, and that others that do not come
under the civil service rule will not be dis
turbed until after the tariff bill is passed
and the terms of incumbents have ex
pired.
Certain people who had apprehensions
lest Major McKinley might lack decision
of character have been relieved of all
[ anxiety on that score. He is affable, he
is gracious, and even cordial to to every
one who calls, but he is like a stone wall
when the candidate runs against him, and
has as larsre a stock of silence at his disposal
as General Grant. People are beginning
' to notice a resemblance in President Mc-
Kinley to the silent soldier. He can listen
patiently and with manifest attention to
whatever is said to him and let the
speaker go without offering any reply
whatever. He does not gush lite Garfield,
or endeavor to explain his difliculties like
Hayes. He is never rude and gruff, like
â¢Cleveland, and he does not give his
visitors the chills, as President Harrison
did. He manaees to show a cordial inter
est in every one, but is firm when people
try to crowd him.
President McKinlev places himself
behind the Republican, Senators and
Representatives, and will consider no
applications for office that do not bear
their indorsement. He recognizes them as
the representatives of the people end as
the best source of information concerning
tbe character and qualifications of condi
dates of their districts and States.
SHERMAN AND DIPLOMATS.
Distinguished Foreign Assembly Meets
the New Secretary of
State.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 10.â Tbe
corps diplomatic was received by Secre
tary Sherman in the diplomatic parior of
the State Department at 11 o'clock this
morning and shortly afterward presented
to the President.
The members of the corps assembled in
the diplomatic reception-room shortly be
fore 11 o'clocjc by appointment, the Chi
nese. Korean and Turkish Ministers alone
having other attire than the cusiomary
morning dress.
FrocK coata and high silk hats were un
exceptional and all decorations were con
spicuous by their absence.
At 11 o'clock the corps, in a body,
beaded by Sir Julian Paunc6fote, were
usbered by ABoistant Secretaries Rock hi 11
and Adee into the diplomatic parlor,
where they stood in their proper order of
precedence, each head of embassy and
i. â _-.iiiÂ«ii being supported by vis secre
taries and attaches.
Secretary Sherman invited Major-Gen
eral Miles and his aid, Captain Michles,
who were wan him at the time to witness
the function. The Secretary was escorted
around the entire line and presented to
each diplomat in turn.
At 11:80 o'clock Sir Julian Pauncefote
led the way in a parting handshnke with
the Secretary, with whom all future nego
tiations are to be held, and, followed by
the eighty odd members of the body, went
over to the White House.
GENERAL HASTINGS' MISHAP.
Knocked Down by a Wagon and His Leg
Fractured After Calling Upon
the President.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 10.â
General Russell Hastings of Bermuda,
West Indies, who commanded the
Twenty-third Oh:o Regiment, in which
President McKinley was an officer,
was knocked clown by a wagon while
crossing Fifteenth street, opposite the
Treasury Department, this morning. His
right leg was fractured near the knee
joint.
At the time of the accident General
Hastings and General and Mrs. J. L. Bots
ford of Youngstown, Ohio, were returning
from a visit to president McKinley. Gen
eral Hastings had gone there to say
good-by to his oid comrade preparatory
to sailing for Bermuda on Saturday.
After the accident he was accompanied
to the Emergency Hospital by General
Botsford, who went back to the While
House to tell the President when the frac
ture had been set.
The President sent a bunch of flowers
and a personal note to the iniured man
and later drove to the hospital and held a
consultation with his former cojemand
ing officer and gave directions to the sur
geons to give him the best of care.
When the President was told that the
injury would not result seriously, he re
minded General Hastings that he had last
seen him wounded at Winchester, where
the same leg wa3 injured.
"Now, General, command me day and
night," said President McKinley in leav
ing, "and while you are in the hospit al I
shall make it a pleasant duty tocom c and
I see you. Good by, old fellow."
General Hastings was taken to Garfield
| Hospital soon afterward.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 10. -The
sugar schedule was finished to-day by the
Republican members of the Ways and
Means Committee. The conclusions
reached were foreshadowed in the United
Associated Presses' dispatches of last
night. The differential duty was placed
at J/g of a cent a pound. A countervailing
duty against bounty-paying countries was
fixed â¢â o as to equalize the net amount of
the bounty â that is to say, the exact
amount of the bounty lens any internal
revenue tax levied.
The woolen schedule was taken up at
the afternoon and evening sessions and
several tentative rates adopted, but an
other session will be necessary before the
schedule is completed.

CONDENSED MILKS
AND CREAMS.
AN ITEM OF INTEREST
TO MOTHERS.
It has been disclosed by the in-
vestigation of Dr. Wenzell, the
Chemist of the Board of Health,
that the so-called evaporated creams
are nothing but pure and simple
condensed milk, and in many in-
stances very poor condensed milk
at that, and while little or nothing
can be said in favor of these
evaporated creams by Dr. Wenzell,
still less is said in favor of most
brands of condensed milk, which
suffer equally under his searching
analysis.
Amid all this investiga-
tion and hue-and-cry one
prominent fact has been
brought out with unusual â 
distinctness, and that is,
the Gail Borden EAGLE
s Brand of Condensed Milk
' has t passed through the
fiery furnace of investiga-
tion of a most searching
character, with its usual
great success.
Every brand, except the Gail
Borden Eagle Brand, that has come
under the attention of the chemist
has had more or less criticism be-
stowed upon it, but the Gail Bor-
den Eagle Brand has been found to
be without a single flaw, and has
been pronounced to be the purest
and the richest in quality of any
brand on the market; superior to
evaporated creams in richness;
stronger. than any milk now before
the public.
The Pure Food Investi-
gation bids fair to be a
most searching one, and
the public have a great
interest at stake, and it is
with pleasure that we re-
fer now to one , brand that
seems to have met with

SLURRED BY THE FAKER.
Sacramento People Indlarnant Over
the Examiner's Uncalled-for
Abusa.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 10.â Much
indignation prevails amonp the most re
spectable citzens of Sacramento with ref
erence to the uncalled-for slurs cast upon
them by the Examiner this morning,
wherein the peop.e who applauded Sen
ators Morehouse and BoyCe and the vote
by which the Examiner's manaper was
adjudged guilty of contempt are de
nounced as the "ragtag of the lobby and
the offscourings of all social conditions."
The extracts from the Examiner of this
morning are as follows:
Women were there who would have turned
ihe thumb on the gladiators of the Roman
arena, and the ragtag of the lobby, the off
scourings of all social conditions, were
leagued in evidence, tier on tier.
In another part of the article the de
cent people of Sacramento who applauded
Senator Morehouse':* stinginc castigation
of the libeious rascals are abused as fol
lows with the pen of a fishwife:
To be sure he won sovie applause from the
lobby, but there never yet was a whipped
scoundrel who appealed to the delectable
gathering who crawl about the Capitol halls
who did not fnd a ready and sympathetic
hand.
These are the terms with which the
convict-labor newspaper brands the honest
men and virtuous women of Sacramento
who dared to applaud a Senator's denun
ciation of blackmailers and thugs. Like
a road dog, foaming at the mout", gnash
mc; its teeth and snarling and snapping at
every one on the road, the Examiner ran
amuck in Sacramento yesterday, and was
checked by running into the net of the
poundni aster.
The quality and quantity of the Exam
iner's unpopularity were illustrated last
night, and are being illustrated to-day by
the handshakings that were indulged in
and by thecongratuiauons which are being
exchanged between business men on the
official condemnation of the ex-organ of
Southern Pacific boodle.
"Will this denunciation by the highest
legislative tribunal in the State cause the
Examiner to be a little less obscene, a lit
tle less mendacious, a little less scurrii
ous? ;I was the question- generally asked
last night, and the reply came this morn
ing with the arrival of the Examiner,
whose columns reeked with abuse and
lies.
True to its initincts of robbing its news
boys, as it has robbed and does rob its
space-writers nnd reporters, the Examiner
foresaw yesterday that there would possi
bly be a demand for copies of the sheet
this morning to see what it would say
about its own condemnation and raised
its price a cent or so on the newsboys.
Millionaire Hearst needed a cent or a half
cent more on the price of the hundred
copies of the paper which vrere circulated
in the capital to-day and he tried to take
it out of the sweat of the poor boys, who, j
unable to obtain any other employment, j
earn a precarious livelihood by selling
newspapers on the streets.
But the boys were spirited in their pov
erty and refused to pay the robber toll,
and the result was that the Examiner re
mained in the bookstores, while the boys
earned much more than their usual wage
by selling The Call.
The Assembly committee resumed its
inquiry this morning and rigorously ex
amined members of the Assembly on the
lines already stated in The Call as to
â whether they knew of any briber}' or had
ever heard of any; whether they had re
ceived any writings or telegrams with
reference to the bill, or whether they gave
any newspaper reporter or any one else
any information on which the Examiner
charges were baaed.
The object of the last question was to
ascertain whether there was a.iy truth in
the testimony of Reporter Levings to the
effect that he had received some informa
tion as to bribery from members of the
Legislature. Thus lar no member has
said that he gave the reporter or any one
else such information. Should all the
members answer to the same effect, and j
there are but very few left, the committee
will determine whether it will proceed
against the reporter for perjury.
Superintendent James of the Western
Union Telegraph Company appeared be
fore the committee to-iiay and refilled
that he hud made diligent search for tele
prams addressed to or sent by Senator
Voorheis and had been unable to find any. i
Assemblyman Betlman, one of the Ex
aminer's warmest friends, swore that he
had been iniormed that Georee W. Baker,
Will Dargie of Oafcland and the Iquor j
men were interested in Assembly bill 273. I
He gave no information to the Examiner j
reporters, because he had none to giv-%
aa'l had heard nothing that would lead
him to believe that there was anything
wrong about the bill. He was absent at j

Hemmed In and the Water Supply Is Cut Or.
;he time the bill came up in the Hodse'
but if he had been there he would have
voted for it.
Before the bill came up he had asked a
liquor-dealer in San Francisco, an inti
mate friend of his, whether the liquor
nn n wanted the bll passed, and he re
ceived a dispatch informing him that his
friend was not interested in the matter.
Attorney Clunie, representing the ExÂ»
aminer, apologized to nearly all the wit
nesses for the insinuations contained in
the libel. Thus, after Power of Placer ]
bad concluded his testimony, Clunie said:
"Mr. Power, the Examiner never intended
to intimate in any manner that you had
done anything improper in regard to this
bill."
Assemblyman Valentine remarked that
the Examiner was not giving the apology
as much publicity as it had given the
libel."
'â¢Why have you not apologized for the ;
Examiner to the San Francisco delega
tion?' 1 asked Mr. Valentine.
Mr. Glunie lined to make any expla
nation of the implied slur on the San
Francisco delegation.
When Assemblyman McGrath took the
witness-stand he said, "Mr. Clunie used to
work for me and be ought to known me."
"Yes," saM Clunie with a short, dry
laugh, "I got him out. That's all right."
After the examination of Mr. McGrath
had been concluded Mr. Ciunie asked,'
"Well, Mr. McGrath, if you knew of any
Assemblyman being bribed you wouldn't
come down here an ! tell it, would you?"
"No, sir," replied McGratb.
Then Mr. Clunie laughed the dry laugh
again.
The committee finished the list of As
semblymen without having found one to
corroborate the testimony of Levings that
lie had received some of his information
concerning the charges of bribery from
members of the Assembly.
Speaker Coombs was the only witness
before the Assembly who admitted that
he had spoken with an Examiner reporter
regarding the rumors of bribery In con
nection with Assembly bill No. 273.
Levings of the Examiner came to him
on the evening before the libel appeared
in that paper and asked him as to what
parliamentary procedure should be ob
served in getting bill 273 back from the
Governor.
In response to a question by the com
mittee Mr. Coombs said that he had heard
of rumors of bribery after the bill had
passed, but that he had not said anything
to Mr. Levings to the effect that such
rumors existed.
The committee adjourned until 2 p. m.
to-morrow.
BILL 273 VETOED.
Governor Budd Points Out Alleged
Defects In the Famous
Measure.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. March 10.âGov
[ ernor Budd to-day sent a message to the
Assembly vetoing Assembly bill 273, out
of the passage of which grew the charges
by the Examiner of bribery. In his mes
sage the Governor says:
Acts which provide for the disqualification
of a prejudiced or biased Judge are in opera
tion in other States, and any preper legisla
tion which will relieve a litigant from the ne
cessity of having his rase tried before a Judge
who is biased or prejudiced against him, or
who has a fixed opinion on the case, is desir
able and praiseworthy.
A statute having for its purpose such relief
Already exists as to Justices' courts, but the
fact of the limited jurisdiction of such courts
and the fact that a new trial on appeal can
alwayi be had in the Superior Court makes
regulations which are beneficial fn tne limited
teiritoriat jurisdiction of Justices' courts in
expedient aud dangerous in Superior courts.
A careful scrutiny of the terms of bill No.
273 has led me to believe that in its present
lorm it should not become law.
While decisions are nnmerous holding that
when tne expression "when it appears" occurs
in a law of ihis kind it is construed as requir
ing an allegation of fact", not opinions, con
clusions or hearsay, yit the provision con
tained in the bill, "that he does believe," may
moaity these decisions to such an extent that
such belief may be sufficient to cause the dis
qualiccation of a Judge, which tne introducer
from his statement says was not his intention.
And the words "adjoining county" should
read â¢â¢another county."
It is not definite enough as to the affidavit
upon which it is sought to disqualify the
Judge. No provision is made for counter
affidavits. Tlu time when the affidavit can be
filed is not definitely fixed. It might be re
sorted to at so late a stage of the proceedings
that great expense to litigants and incon
venience to Witnesses, courts and jurymen
would result.
After conferring with the introducer of this
bill and other members they concluded that a
new bill could be passed, which would be free
from the objections to wnicu bill 273 was
open, and which would at t tie same time per
mit a litigant to legally object to a prejudiced
and biased Judge. 1 understand that such a
bill has since been introduced and passed by
your honorable body and is now pending be
fore the Senate.
The bill to which the Governor refers is
Bridgford's Assembly bill 977, which
strikes out the words, "oelieves or ha*
reasons to believe," and allows counter
affidavits. In fact it is just such a bill as
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 11, 1897.
the Governor desires. It ha 9 passed the
Assembly and is now in the Senate.

Inspiring Scene In the Senate
Chamber While Morehouse
Was Speaking.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 10.â Justice
William H. Dwyer, a prominent Demo
crat of thi-j city*, returned irom Sacra
memo this morniog, and gave a spirited
description of ihe Bcene in i he Slate Sen
ate on Tuesday morning during the pro
ceedings incident to the charges of bribery
made by the San Francisco Examiner.
"Senator Morehouse is not of my po
liticai faith," said Justice Dwyer, "but he
is pre-eminently the man most talked
about and most admired by all the people
about the Legislature at this time, and
the manner in which he has conducted
the investigation of charee3 by the Ex
aminer has won for him the indorsement
of all, irrespective of political parties.
"The Bcene in the Senate chamber yes
terday morning was inspiring. The
chamber was crowded and M< rehouse
captured the almost breathless attention
of the vast crowd the moment he arose to
reply to the argument offered by Attorney
George A. Knight in behalf of the Ex
aminer correspondents, and he held it
without effort until the close of his re
marki. The crowd seemed swayed by his
every word, and during his pauses not a
sound could be heard except his voice.
"The great crowd was with him and
drank in his eloquence as if under a hyp
notic spell. The speaker was in n man
ner personal and directed his remarks
solely in defense of his aseociates and de
nunciation of their calumniators; but the
personality of the man, his powerful force
of expression, made him the idol of
the hour, an i when occasion offered
the rules of the Senate or the commands of
the Sergcant-at-Arms could not preyent
both men and women from rising in a
mass, cheering and waving bats and
handkerchiefs as an expression of their
enthusiasm.
"The proceedings are causing the most
intense interest in every circle in Sacra
mento. Everybody denounces the Exam
iner and its men lor their apparently un
warranted and malicious attacks, and is
wholly in accord with Senator Morehouse
in his war upon their slanderer."
IN A HEATeD DEBATE.
Assemb'ymen Grow Bitter In Dis
cussing 1 Agricultural District
Debts.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 10.â Senate
bill 90, appropriating $75,000 to pay the
debts of agricultural dis net associations,
was the subject of a heated debate in the
Assembly (his evening. The life had been
taken out of it Jast night by the amputa
tion of the enacting clause, but it was
resuscitated by a motion to reconsider,
and the sticklers for economy immediate
ly set about clubbing out its brain*.
Shanahan led the supporters of the bill
in advocating its merits, and the challenge
was responded to by Valentine of Los
Angeles, who read the law on the indebted
ness of agricultural association-! and other
corporations and the duty of the State
regarding the same. The debts of the
agricultural associations were, under the
law, Dersonal obligations of the directors
oi the various di.->trici9. He understood
that the bill wouid fit the majority of the
cases if the appropriation were cut down
to about $6000. Certain parlies had be
come responsible for the debts. They
were private, personal debts and were not
claims airainst the State.
"Toe gentleman lrom Shasta," con
tinued Mr. Valentine, '"has talked for
twenty-four hours, at a cost to in State
of $21)6 per hour, in order to save the pay
men I of $5 salary to some poor attache,
and now ne is trying to induce us to pay
the debis of those directors, that we have
no more obligation to pay than we have to
pay ttie debis of the gentleman from
Shasta. I hope you will not commit this
great blunder, this criminal waste of the
Pioney of the taxpayers in the payment of
private debts."
Sbanahan gazed in open-mouthed as
tonishment at the rash man from the
citrus belt and rose to reply, but he was
rapped down by the Speaker, on the
ground that the previous question had
been ordered on the motion to strike out
the enacting clause.
"Never mind," he said, "I'll reply to
him some other time."
Valentine s-eme.l equally astonished,
and said, "I should not be blamed for
this," as the Speaker rapped him down
also. Mr. Valentine seemed to be una
ware that he had done a thing to Mr.
iSlianahan.
MrClellan hoped that no such iniquitous
legi lation should pass.
"Who are the presidents of these agri
cultural di trict associations?" demanded
Kee.gan. "Who are they that we are asked
to make this appropr ation? They are a
lot of men we don't know, who are coming
in to ciaim this $75,000. If anybody has a
bill against the State let h:ni bring in his
bill and ask us to iay it."
The motion to str.fca out waa defeated
by a vote of 33 to 28, and the bill was
placed at the fool of tit* spÂ»ca Senate tile

JONES OPPOSED
TO CINCH BILLS
Says Many Measures Are
Devised to Harass
Corporations.
Why He Does Not Favor the
Proposed Hospital- Site
Enactment.
Its Passage Would Cost the City of San
Francisco From $50,000
to $75,000. â¢
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 10.â "My
experience as a member of the Committee
on Corporations," said Assemblyman
Leon E. Jones of San Francisco, "has
opened my eyes to the existence of a large
number, of cinch bills directed against cor
porations. Tbe^e bills are unjust because
they demand unreasonable things and are
introduced for the purpose of harassing
and annoying the corporations at which
they are aimed. I have always opposed
and always will oppose such bills.
"Tne Committee on Corporations, of
which lam a member," added Mr. Jones,
ASSEMBLYMAN iEON E. JONES OF SAN FRANCISCO.
"reported favorably upon an<l materially
assisted in tbe passatre of a bill allowing
the City and County of San Francisco to
levy a tax for the purpose of building a
new County Hospital. We are now pay
ing Borne attention to a bill which has
passed the Senate and, which is now on
the Senate special file tin the Assembly.
The bill was insDired^by and is being
pushed by Adolph Sutro. It prohibits
any hospital, etc., from being erected
within 3000 feet of anj stream, lake or
reservoir. Tbe measure is intended to
prevent the building of the new City and
County Hospital in the vicinity of the
Almshouse and a tract of Und owned by
Sutro.
"If the bill should pass the House and
receive approval of the Governor it would
nece 6itaie the expenditure ot from $50,
--000 to $75,000 for the purchase of a new
site. The site near the Almshouse is a
fine one for the hospital. The ground is
high and the drainage is excellent.
"I have always worked industriously on
all the committees of which I i.aye had
the honor to be a merabsr and I spare no
pains to familiar. z^ myself with the de
tails, and the objects of each bill that
comes before v-<. When the Legislature
shall have finished its labors and ad
journed and the smoke of partisan issues
has blown away, lam confident that the
people will be thankful to the Republican
majority in the Assembly for the good
work which it has done."

Senators Agree With the Assembly
Proposal to ACjourn on
March 20.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 10.â As
soon as the Senate received the message
from the Assembly agreeing to adjourn
onthe2otbat noon tne Assembly mes
sage was taken up and a resolution wa*
carried without debate, so it is now set
tled that adjournment wil be taken at

especially the twelve-day rule â was car

bills. About tmr.y Senate bills were ex

duplicate bills which have passed the
House were put in their place.
Only one bi.l was considered on final
nasssee â that maKing an appropriation of

V Hiyne and W. W. Foote, amounting
to $10,000 each. for services as special coun
sel in tne case of the Pacific
against the Board of Railroad Commis
sioners.
Durine the ar ument Morebouse stated
that the action was known to be useless
before the trial of the case, but he favored
.the payment of the attorney fees because
the services had been rendered.
Braoiihart denied this, stating that the
case i; at least demonstrated that this was
the fir-t comro ssion that the railroad
could not control.
speaking for the bill, said that
the fi ht should be carried to a fin sh or a
con-titutional amendment aoolishing the

WOULD WORK A HARDSHIP
Protest Against the Bill Extending
the Power of the Board
of Health.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 10.âCon
siderable opposition is being manifested
to the passage of the Ass-mbly bill which
is intended to givÂ« county boards of
health the power to suopena witnesses
and comp^ tnem to produce their books
and papers for examination.
It is claimed by the wholesale butchers,
dairymen and stockraisers that the meas
ure will serve no good purpose for the
public at large, and that it will only work
severe and unjust hardshps on those en
gaged in these lines of business. The
views of the=e men, as expresi-ei by a
prominent wholesale butcher, are as foi
lows:
"We are opposed to the bill for the rea
son that it would give b ards of health
power to inquire into the private business
sffairs of those aga n*t whom it is evi
dently directed, through the inspectors
who are appointed by the boards of health,
fur political purposes.
"I say for po.iucal purposes, as no man
of ability and th<? requisite experience,
considering tbe fact that the salary is only
$75 a month, could be found to perform
ilie duties of the p>>-ition.
"This would leave she parties engaged
in these industrieslat the mercy of the
boards, for any inspector could Subpena
thtm to appear beiorp th* board and com
pel th mto brin,' books und i ap?rs. And
the mere f iCt that any butcher's or dairy
man's conduct and business in Pan Fran
ci-co â whether he was Carrying on a legiti
mate business or not â was under investi
gation would injure him to serious
utent on account of the notoriety con
nected wl h it.
"We are in favor of the law as it stands
now, foritpive* the Boa d of Health <>r
any other citizen ample power to subpena
and arrest any person who has not carried
on the business in accordance with the
pure ood 1 ws already adopted. As the
law is now they can arrest anybody and
bring him before a Police Court to be
tried.
"What these boards of health want is to
try these parties twice for one effer.se â
firs to bring them before the Board of
Heahti and when in the judgment of the
Board of Healti they are guiltr, it will be
compe led to swÂ«Â»ar to a complaint cbars
inj; these men with the offense and bring
the matter up In the Police Court.
"The butchers, dairymen and stock
raisers do not think it is just that they
should be selected out of tne many kimis
of in I ustri**<Â« that are conducting a busi
ness in San Francisco aud he compelled to
practically app-ar before two courts in
s.cad of one."

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 10.â The
State Department has received a cable
message from Con3ul-General L?e at
Havana announcing that the New York
corresj ondent Scovel was released to-day.
CHICAGO, 111., March 10.â A special to
the Daily News from Washington says:
The news that the Queen of Spain has or
dered the release oi Syivester Scovel, cor
respondent of a New York newspaper,
who is in a Cuban priaou, creates much in
terest.
The release was made on the petition of
Scovei's father. Ha requested the release
"Â« n the ground of mercy, not of justice."
The father of the correspondent made a
touching application to the Spanish Min
ister, and attributed his son's action to
his zeal to serve his newspaper and not to
a desire to aid the insurgent-' cause.
The Spanish authoriti-s refused to have
the release made through the ordinary
â  iiplomatic way because they did not
want a record made of it in the State De
ia:tment as a precedent. Tne Spanish
Minister, on receipt of the letter from
Scovei's father, indorsed it and forwarded
it to the Queen, who ordered his release.
It is reported here to-day that Scovel
will refuse to accept the release on the
conditions imposed by tho Spanish Gov
ernment. This information comes from
the newspaper which employed tha cor
respondent. If Scovel maintains this at
titude the Spanish Minister intimates
that be will take no further interest in the
case.

AN EMBANKMENT
Catastrophe Caused by the
Heavy Rainfall in
Indiana.
Newspaper Men Refused Trans
portation to the Scene of
the Wreck.
But It Is Known That Five Persons
Have Been Killed and Two
Badly Injured.
EVANBVILLE, Ind., March 10.â The
Chicago and Nashville Limited passenger
train, south-bound from Chicago, was
wrecked this morning at 10 :30 o'clock at a
point one mile south of Hazelton, Ind.,
and thirty-seven miles north of Evans
ville, on the Evansville and Terre Haute
road.
It â was a very difficult matter to obtain
accurate information, as the railroad offi
cials were unusually reticent and refused
newspaper men transportation* to the
scene of the wreck. The latest and most
reliable report is rive men were killed and
two seriously injured, as follows:
Killed â Herbert B. Allen of Evansville,
caught in the smokpr and drowned; Jo
seph Boleman of Evansville, fireman;
John Sears of Terre Haute, conductor;
two unknown.
Injured â Brakeman Hauisen of Evans
ville and G. B. Henderson, brother of ex-
State Auditor Henderson. Both are se
riously injured.
The accident was the result of the heavy
rains in Southern Indiana, and when the
trajn reached the fill the embankment
suddenly gave way and the eneine, bag
gage-car and part of the smoker dropped
into about six feet of water.
A telephone message from Hazelton
says there is another crevasse between
White River bridge and the one where tne
train was wrecked, it is spreading rap
idly and the damage to the roadbed will
be very serious. It was reported that an
overcoat marked "J. T. Phillips" was
found floating in the water near the
wreck.
The damage to the roadbed of the
Evansville and Terre Haute and the
Evansvilie and Indianapolis railroads by
the recent rains and floods is estimated at
$1,000,000.
WOMEN OFFICE-SEEKERS.
Belva Lockwood's Partner Wants the Colom
bian Miss/on â Europe Would Suit
an lowa Lady.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 10 âA Sun
special from Washington says: Miss Mar
ilia Ricfeer of Xi-w Hampshire desires to be
appointed Minister to the Republic of
Colombia, and Miss Cora C. Weed of Mus
catine, lowa, nas applied for one of the
European positions. There is nothing in
the law to prevent the appointment of a
wen.an to a consular or diplomatic place,
but it is doubtful whether & foreign Gov
ernment would receive an envoy of that
sex. The duties of Consul might be per
formed easily by a woman.
Mis? Ricker was formerly a resident of
"Washington and a partner of Beiva A.
Lockwood. She was the first woman ad
mitted to practice in the courts of New
England. She is a large, fine looking per
son, 4U years old or thereabout, with short
curly hair and rather masculine air. She
was for years a familiar figure on the
streets of this city.
Miss Weed is said to be a bright young
woman and has held several appointments
under the State government of lowa.
Mrs. J. Elien Foster, lormerly of lowa,
is a daily visitor at the White House. She
asks the appointment oi her husband as
Governor of New Mexico, and bases his
claims upon her services to the Republi
can party in the campaigns. She has not
been able to see the President, but has
been down at the Interior Department
and has had several interviews with Sec
retary Porter. There are several other
women here assisting their husbands or
sons to appointment.
Mrs. McKinley, however, has not re
ceived any women otfics-seekers, except
Mrs. Logan and Mrs. Fred Grant, who
know her personally and are always wel
come at the "W hite House.

WHITE PLAYS CHECKMATE.
Heard of an Effort to Delay the Appro

bor at San Pedro.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 10.â It
seems that the persevering C. P. Hunting
ton has not yet given up all hope of defeat
ing the appropriation for ban Pedro har
bor. Notwithstanding the almost uuani
mons report of the commission against
Santa Monica, and in favor of San Pedro,
he and his agents are endeavoring to de
feat the execution of the appropriation act
of Congress.

ington, Senator Frye and Engineer Hood
of the Southern Pacific had appeared De
fore the new Secretary of War and had
endeavored to gain his consent to a delay
in making contracts tor the improvements
at San Pedro until Mr. Morgan, one of the
members of the commission, could file a
minority report dissenting irom the views
of the majority of that board.
Senator White spent an hour with Sec
retary Alger and explained tne whole
situation to him. The Secretary had not
Deen familiar with the matter and thanked
Senator White for posting him.

UNDOING
A BAD MAN
AND HIS
PERFIDY
Wage - Earners Learn the
Truth of Hearst's Friend
ship for Them.
THE HIGH PRIEST OF BLACK
MAIL REVEALED AS HE
REALLY IS.
The Cotton-Mill Employes Protest Against
the Operation of His SanQuentin JutemiL
Some Very Caustic Criticisms From Business Men
on the Faker " Examiner's " Convict
Connections.
The Labor Council and Unions Preparing to Investigate
the Methods of the Viper Journal That
Betrays Them.
The undoing of & bad man has begun. The story of his doable-dealing has been
given to the world, and the signs of the reckoning are already visible. The mask
behind which he has been so long masquerading has been lilted and those who have
eves may see him for what ne is worth. Already the finger, that ringer that somehow
or other always has a tendency to point at the guiltr, is directed toward him. A
wrong is in a lavorable way to be righted. A hypocrite has been exposed and people
now know VV. K. Hearst as impersonated and spiritualized in the San Francisco
Examiner for what he really is.
There is no tendency on the part of the public to interfere with this apostle of
blackmail and high priest of thug journalism m his business methods. If he cares
to buy his supplies in Jericho or San Quentin there is no law that can stop him.
There was no disposition to criticize the action of his business manager, T. T. Wil
liams, in making a special contract with Warden Hale for Examiner twine supplies.
Williams, of course, was dome this for the millionaire who employed him. The
prison authorities knew this, and now that the world may read Mr. Hearst as he
really is there is no tendency to cast odium upon the man who actually engineered
the deal.
Already the "Monarch" of hypocrites has begun to prepare for the wrath that is
to come. It is preparing to explain that it was forced to buy twine goods from ban
Quentin Prison because it was unable to get a similar article maae by free iabor.
Already it is preparing to declare that it was not a desire to save 2 cents a pound on
Jute goods that led it to make a special contract for convict-made articles, but rather
to explain that one of the purposes in establishing the jutemill wa3 to protect the
people of the State from the operations of a trust in this class of goods.
Tnere is little to be said in reply to these arguments. The goods that the Exam
iner uses are to-day and hare been a special article of manufacture by the local cotton
mills. The Examiner, it is true, saved not a large amount in buying the convict
output, but the issue is not a matter of dollars and cents, but of principle.
The moment Hearst sees fit to repudiate his prison contract by caving 2 cents
more a pound for his goods there are on sale in a score of places in this City tons of
twine similar to that be now purchases from the convict jutemills.
The Veil Falls From the Eyes of
the Workingmen of San Francisco.
By 1 o'clock yesterday nearly every workingman in the City had read The Call's
expose of the Examiner's hypocrisy in masquerading as the champion of free labor
while It was in reality a patron of convict labor. The proof was so conclusive that it
was not even questioned, and many expressed curiosity as to what apology or excuse
the jutemill monarch would make, if any. To many the plain, unvarnished disclosure
of facts was a painful sarprise, for they bad heard the Faker's profession of friendship
for free Jabor so often that they really believed it was sincere.
At the meetings of the unions and in places where workingmen are accustomed
to congregate the unmasking of the hypocrite by The Call was generally discussed
last evening. The expose was aa eye-opener, and judging from the expressions of
those who i aye been deceived, the matter will not pass without some further notice.
The duplicity of a large daily newspaper in pretending to be the fxeina of free
labor and dealing in convict goods was heartily condemned by all.
At the Granite Cutters' Union, at 1159 Mission street, the secretary read to the
union The Call's expose.
It will be remembered that when this union was agitating the park scandal â the
Grant monument being dressed by Folsom felons â the Examiner was loudly cham
pioning the union's cause. It did so in its publications of May 12, 13, 14 and 15, 1896.
At the same time its mailroom supplies were being made by convicts' hands.
As Cotton-Mill Workers
View the Examiner
o . o
Â£ OAKLAND, CAL., March William F. Doig, the assistant man- %
jo ager of the California Cotton-Mills, said to-day: "Some of our employes Â°
o took a ball of our twine this morning, as soon as they read THE CALL, %
8 ' and called upon R. M. Fitzgerald, President of the Board of Prison Di- Â°
' o rectors. They were going to ascertain if our twine was not as good and Â©
Â£ in fact the same material, and then urge him to stop such work. He is a Â£
3 friend of the laborer, and has shown it in more' ways than one. In fact, Â©
Â° he and Warden Hale have been very favorable to us, and whenever they 3
P> received application for goods that we manufactured have sent us the or- 3
to der. Mr. Fitzgerald has assured us on various occasions that the prison- Â©
g ers were making only sugar and grain bags, and would not be allowed to Â°
jo compete in our business. 1 firmly believe that he was not aware of this Â©
C gross perfidy on the part of the Examiner. Â©
t â  " Mr. Fitzgerald was not in his office to-day, but the men will appeal 5
o to him to protect their bread and butter. They propose to keep at this 3
â  \Â°\ until the works at San Quentin are either stopped by law or the products 3
Â£ are refused on the markets. v : - 3
;Â° "I am not surprised after all that the Examiner has done this. I Â°
o believe it to be capable of doing anything. It is absolutely without Â©
0 principle, and this matter of purchasing twine is only in line with its Â°
% daily course. The abominable, home-destroying agency Is not appar- Â©
% ently contented with trying to ruin the minds of our children, but is Â°
â  o anxious to rob them of their means of support .-,'. . %
, % â  "For many years, in fact ever, since that jutemill at San Quentin %
0 was opened, our people have been doing all in their power to prevent the â¢Â«Â»
o .competition from becoming disastrous, and so long as it was confined to %
!Â° bag-making we did not feel it, but if the prison is being encouraged by 1Â°
o the Examiner to make goods In competition with our people then the con- Â©
2 dition is indeed serious. ;. *j
fc 11 At present we employ 350 people, and when the new tariff is in 5
% effect we expect to employ another hundred, but not if we have to pit 3
o our honest employes against the product of convicts." '_" / ' 3.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 11, 1897.
jreat crowds congregated about the Business Office of THE CALL yesterday to discuss the exprse of Hearst's Examiner
as an exclusive patron of convict supplies. It was a sullen and angry throng. In their indignation at being
betrayed, business men and workers forgot the humorous side of the story. The expose of Hearst's convict
connections was posted on the bulletin-board, about which the people surged all day.
The workingmen have good memories, wnich served them well last evening when
they made a careful comparison of these tell-tale dates. Much of the session was con
sumed in discussing the matter, and-ii is needless to say that no flowery resolutions to
the Examiner were passed. The Examiner's representatives, usually present with
ready-made resolutions complimentary to itself, showed the good judgment to keep
away from the labor unions last evening.
The Labor Council to Investigate the
Viper Journal That Betrayed It.
The "Jutemill Monarch" must answer for its sinning and double dealing to the
San Francisco Labor Council. The members of that organization understand that
they cannot prevent Mr. Hearst from buying his supplies where he pleases, but they
ask that they be not hoodwinked by the paper he owns. They realize that they, in
company with all other wage-earners, have been betrayed and deceived. The leaders
of the council are so indignant that they can nottrust themselves to speak.
"I caa tell you this," said a prominent member of the council, "that something

will happen in the council before many days. The labor onions have been betrayed;
they have been nursing a viper in their midst, and they have discovered it, and 1 am
very much mistaken if they do not take action to set itself right."
The Labor Council is composed of representatives of certain of the labor unions of
the City. It has kept itself free from interference with affairs not directly connected
with labor interests, and especially, as the members say, from "newspaper contro
versies," but they feel that a Ban Francisco business concern, regardless of its
character or by whom conducted, that deals in prison-made goods is one that calls
for an investigation. It is^propoted that an investigation shall be held. The Labor
Council meets Friday night.
The California Labor Convention, representing over thirty trades unions,
formed in December for the purpose of proposing and amending labor laws, will hold
a meeting, probably its last, on Sunday evening. It presented some twenty-two
labor bills to the Legislature. Among the bills proposed was one touching tnis mat
ter of prison-made goods. It was "An act to provide for the branding of all articles
manufactured in prisons."
This act, however, was stricken out, as the report of the work of the convention
says, because "the convention placed itself on record as being unalterably opposed to
manufacturing or producing any article in the penal institutions of this State that
will come in competition with free labor. We recommend the passage of a law brand
ing goods manufactured in other States."
This is high ground for the labor convention to take. It refuses to recognize the
fact that the great State of California could be guilty of knowing y manufacturing
goods in its prisons that would enter into competition with its free labor. It. is not
likely that this convention will adjourn without taking cognizance of the fact that the
so-called champion of free labor is discovered to be covertly taking advantage of the
cheap labor and machinery of San Quentin to save a few dimes.
James Rose is president of the labor convention and Guy Lathrope is its secretary.
Did Hearst Violate the Law in
His Contract for Convict Goods?
The faot that the Examiner people were not required to file an affidavit in accord
ance with law that the twine was for their own nse is due to the courtesy extended
the paper by Warden Hale. As the guardian of the prison the Warden did not believe
that Mr. Hearst was going to resell the twine. The Warden believed Business Man
ager Williams desired the convict-made goods for the Mission-street journal, and it
can be said to Mr. Hearst's credit that the confidence of the prison manager was not
violated.
But according to the strict interpretation of the Ostrom act, Mr. Hearst should
have been obliged to file an affidavit, when his paper made its contract for twine, the
THE UNDOING OF A BAD MAN.
same as any other customer of the jutemills. Section 3 of the act fixing the condi
tions of the sale of jute goods, passed in 1893, is plain in its meaning, and Mr. Hearst's
manager, but for the Warden's courtesy, would have been obliged to abide with
its conditions. Here is the clause that covers tbe case of Wanton Willie:
Section 3. All orders for jute goods must be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth that
the amount of goods contained in the order are for individual and personal use of applicant;
said affidavit to be subscribed and sworn to before some Notary Public or by a Justice of the
Peace residing in the township in which the applicant resides; provided, that any applicant,
as heretofore provided for, who falsely and fraudulently procures jute goods under the pro
visions of this act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
There was evidently no intent on the part of Mr. Hearst to commit a misdemeanor,
so he could have made the required affidavit with good grace. Siill possibly the case
was such an awkward one that the young millionaire was anxious to keep himself
dark a â¢ far as official records might go.
"I do not regard our action as a violation of the law," said Warden Hale yester
day. "Even if it should be so considered it would only be a technical violation. The
purpose and meaning of the act is to prevent the Prison Directors selling grain or
other bags to the middlemen. The latter might, if no restrictions were placed on the
sale of the bags, either buy openly or get others to buy all the grain sacks tbat we
have and corner the market. In the case of , ram or other sacks we require the pros
pective purchasers to make affidavit as to the use to which the goods ordered are to be
put. This has invariably been done, as shown by our books.
"With the sale ol wrapping twino to the Examiner the case is different We
know that the managers of the paper purchased the twine for the use of the paper
and not to resell. When the Examiner people first wanted us to furnish them with
twine we did not have the sizes they wanted. Ours was not quite heavy enough, so
we made the size that was desired. This is an extra heavy and an odd size and the
very nature of it precluded the possibility of it being used for any purpose except to
tie up Examiners with.
"As I said, there may have been a technical violation of the letter of the law, but
there was no violation of the spirit of the act, which only contemplates the preventing
of middlemen handling or making profit out of good 3 manufactured by the State.
We occasionally make exceptions of this kind. For example, suppose some one
wanted a few yards of burlap for some purpose such as it is occasionally used for, we
would not require an affidavit. We do not resard the sale of a few yards of this stuff
as a flagrant offense, simply because no affidavit accompanies the order."
Hearst's Convict Contract an
Injustice to Dealers in Twine.
C. M. Osborn, of the firm of Neville & Co., manufacturers and dealers in bags,
twine, etc. â I ara strictly opposed to anything in the way of prison-made goods. If
the Examiner had not been able to get tbat twine from the prison mill it is fair to
suppose that it would have patronized some of the local firms dealing in such articles.
We have, at different times, supplied newspapers with such twine for wrapping pur
poses, and if I am not mistaken, we have furnished tne Examiner with some. We
could not, nor could our factory, however, sell it for 5% cents a pound. That is where
the competition of the convict-made twine does both dealers and manufacturers an
injustice to the extent practically of controlling the market. There is no fiber so
cheap as jute, and when the prison-made jute twine can be put on the market for
nearly a third less in price a pound than can be offered by any factory, there is no
chance to sell either jute or other cheap twine. We, as dealers, cannot of course, ac*

In a little pamphlet relating to Alameda County, thousands of copies of which were

The California Jute Mill*, at Clinton Station, on the north arm of the estuary,
cover an entire block of ground and give employment to npwsrd of 400 men,

materialsâ Convict-made good* injure us and tb ahole community. If they do not
:ome into competition with our particular line, .^ey hurt the business of some one
else. I was Warden at San Quentin when tie jutemill was established there. The
manufacture of grain bags by the State prison does not very materially hurt any one
in the business, because only 10 per cent of tne demand in this State is supplied, and
)0 per cent comes from India free of duty. So it is simply limited convict
production in competition with India-made jute bigs. If there were a duty, it would
be different, as then home factories would have a chance to enter the field. But this
manufacturing of jute twine is wrong. That is altogether a different matter. There is
a heavy duty on twine. Congress three wears ap;o simply took the dv y off jute bags
and burlap, and burlap does not by any means cover all jute goods. I was not before
aware that the prison was making this twine, nor that the Examiner was the prin
cipal consumer. I think that ii a letter is written to the Superintendent at the
Pan Quentin jutemill, complaining of the sale of twine, there will be no more of it.
I do not think that it is the purpose of the prison authorities to <io trade an inju-tice.
If the Examiner has a contract for so much twine to be supplied, I think that the
Superintendent will ask to be released from further compliance with the contract,
making is a very convenient thing in all mills of the kind. It turnishes a sort
of fill-in employment to put the men to at spare times. It is not right that the fac-

oners should bÂ», as Jar as possible, self-supporting. They should be taught trades,
: in the teaching should be permitted to produce as little as would be necessary to
:ir own needs without entering into competition with the outside world.
The making of jute goods fits the convicts for that particular employment alone, ana
when they are released they have special knowledge only of work that they muÂ«t go
East to find. Now, if the State, instead of making grain bags and twine, should begin
istruction of large, substantial stone buildings and walls at the prisons and
keep the convicts employed upon them the men would learn stone-cutting, masonry,
plastering and soon; the State would begetting fine, permanent buildings for noth

Double Dealing and Hypocrisy
Characteristic of Hearst's Local Paper.
County Clerk C. F. Curry said : "That method of double-dealing as shown by The
Call's expose is characteristic of the Examiner. Nobody expects sincerity or decency
from that paper. There are some good men connected with the Examiner, but they
are handicapped by the policy of the paper. Of course they will say that lam biased
because the Examiner has attacked me, but that doesn't count in a case like this. The
Examiner x attacks have never hurt me, and they never can, because 1 always do my
duty, and I shall continue to do so, irrespective of what any paper may say or do.
That was a very clever piece of newspaper work Thk Call gave to its readers to-day.
All the brag of the Examiner in regard to objecting to convict labor in making the
base for the Grant monument was shown to be mere wind. The first opportunity it
had to use convict-made goods in its business it did it. To be sure it is a small thing,
but small things show how the wind blows. If the Examiner could gÂ«t Hold of a big
thing in the same way, there is no doubt it would be only too glad to do it. Look at
how quick the Examiner took in the type-setting machines. While pretending to be
the friend of the laboring men, it did all in its power to cut down the amount of work
that was to be given out. It hurt the working-printers and that was about all, for I
am told that it doesn't do the Examiner much good. By the time the machines are
worn out and new ones put in their place about all the profit will go to the makers of
the machines. The Call has got the laugh on the Examiner, and everybody is enjoy
ing the joke, serious as it is."
Captain Lees â I knew of the Examiner's contract with the San Quentin officials
over a year ago. Tom Williams had told me of it as a good stroke of business, saying

that the twine he had been purchasing was made by convict labor in the East, and he
could buy it at San Quentin much cheaper.
C. H. Davies, chairman of the relief committee of toe organized unemployed, and
himself a graduate of Pacific University of Oregon, said:
"If the Examiner's policy were to be pursued to an ultimate conclusion It would
become advantageous to many of our free workingmen to-day to become convicts in
order to have an opportunity to work and reap some of the many benefits.
"The premium offered by the Examiner for labor's sake is: Become a convict and
get a jjb. But will that solve the problem?"
How Oakland Business Men Received the
True Picture of Wanton Willie.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,*
908 Broadway, March 10. ;
When the wage-earners and merchants read The Call this morning they were
not surprised. Surprise is a mild word to use in expressing their stale of feelings.
They were absolutely dumfounded.
For so many years and on so many occasions has the Examiner prated about its
devotion to the cause of the workin man and its horror of convict labor threatening
the bread and butter of honest wage-earners that, as Superintendent Rutherford of
the cotton-mills stated to-day, "a flash of lightning from a clear sky could not have
caused greater surprise."
The matter was discussed by union men and by manufacturers, but most earnestly
of all by the 750 people who make their livine by the looms of East Oakland.
Of the number 400 have been out of work for three years by the closing down
of the California Jutemills, because of the competition at San Quentin, and 350 are
daily employed at the California Cotton-mills. These see the Examiner setting an
example to the State that threatens them and their little ones with starvation, and
they were desperate.
A delegation from the mills at once went into Oakland and tried to see Prison Di
rector Fitzgerald. They were prepared to make a very forcible argument in defense
of their livelihood, but Mr. Fitzgerald was out of town and could not be seen all day.
Superintendent Rutherford of the California Cotton-milis, upon returning from
San Francisco, said:
"The merchants dealing in twine on both sides of the bay are greatly excited over
the expose in The Call to-day. I saw Mr. Beaoer, the president of our concern, in San
Francisco this afternoon and he was denouncing the rascality of such an effort to de
ceive the public as thai practiced for several months past by the Examiner.
â¢'He feels that Thk Call has begun a big fight, but a good one, on behalf of the
working in .-m which is sure to receive the hearty approval of the toilers of every con
dition. Deceit will never do to practice with them. The Examiner practiced the
greatest deceit that it could have ever done and the working classes will not soon for

NEW YORK, N. V., March 10.â Fire in

New York at noon yesterday. The vessel
was lying off Torapkinsville, but was
about to proceed to the Brooklyn Navy
yard.
The forward magazine is surrounded by
coal bunkers. In it were 2000 pounds of
guncotlon and 6000 pounds of powder.
Smoke poured from the magazine, and an
alarm was given.
iTor the first time in the history of the
ship the automatic electric tire alarm
failed to do its duty. Water was let into
the coal-bunkers about the magazine, and
there was no stint in the auantity, so that
before the cruiser bad passed Governor's
I-l;intl she had taken into the hold such a
weight of water that she sank three feet
in draught and had to be handled witb
great caution.
Arriving at the navy-yard the New York
was pumped out. Early this morning an
examination was made into the cause of
the fire. It was found that the fire had
not originated in the magazine, but in the
coal-bunkers adjoining the forward wall.
Had there been a failure of discipline en

service. So, although the outlook has im
proved from the standpoint of Greece and
Crete, it has become somewhat dangerous
in other directions, and Great Britain is
preparing for all eventualities.

Auguste Goustiaux, Acting Greek Con-,

ters from Americans in this City and
throughout the State offering their ser
vices should they be needed. In nearly
every case the writer has seen service and
holds honorable discharge.
In one instance R. C. Hooker of Berke
ley, who was quite well Known here some
years ago as a broker, writes:
I served sixteen years as a commissioned of
ficer in the United States navy, when I volun
tarily resigned to go into a business venture.
I am a graduate of the United States Naval
Academy and have my commission as an of
ficer, and other papers relating to my naval
career.
I beg to refer you to Rear-Admiral Beardslee,
commanding the United States fleet in these
waters.
I have cruised about in Grecian waters a
great deal and am familiar with them. There
is no doubt that Greece will win and I want to
be in it. Very truly yours, R. C. Hooker.

The writer lias addressed similar letters
to P. T. Vrettes and to the Hellenic So
ciety.
Consul Goustiaux has as yet received no
formal reply to his recent telegram ad
dressed to the Consul-General of Greece in
New York, in which he stated that there
were 150 Greeks in this City ready to re
turn home immediately if their country
needed them ; hence he is unable to do
more at the present time than to file all
communications for future consideration.
The local Greek colony is in the mean
time brimming over with enthusiasm.
With very few exceptions â men who are
too advanced in years or who are held
here by strong family ties that cannot in
justice be neglected â nearly every Greek
in this City is ready and anxious to taKe
up arms in behalf of his home and coun
try.
They have engaged a hall on the south
west corner of East and Mission streets,
where most of their leisure time is spent
in drilling. They expect to be uniformed
this coming week.

MOURN IK G AT LOS GATOS.
I Death of Rev. John Pinasco, S.J.,
Former President of Santa
Clara College..
LOS GATOS, Cal., March 10.â Rev.
John Pinasco, S.J., formerly president of
Santa Clara College, died yesterday at the
I Jesuit Novitiate from an attack of pneu
j monia. The dread disease had been
slowly but too surely milking its inroads
for. the past week, forcing the . reverend
gentleman to keep lo.his bed.
The funeral took place from St. Claire's
Ciiurch at Santa Clara this afternoon.
In Father Pina?co the Jesuit order has
lost an eminent member â one who did it
I good service in whatever position he was
| employed, whether as superior or inferior.
I Born in Chiavari, near Genoa, June 11,
1837, he received his early education at
I the archiepiscopal seminary of his native
place, where hf> attended classes until De
cember 39. 1853, when he joined " the
Jesuits. For the term of his novice lite
the provincial father. Alexander Ponza,
sent him to Bonascola, near Carrara,
where he spent two years under a well
skilled master in the ways of perfection
I and staid until 1868; devoting consider
able time to a review of the Latin classics
and a thorough course of rhetoric. At the
j end of the year 1858 he went to the famous
j English college at Stonyhurst, where he
took up the study of philosophy under
the able tutorship of Rev. Joseph Bay ma,
S.J., then one of the inosi prominent pro
lessors of the order in Europe.
â  In 1860. owing to the pressing need of
subjects for the California mission, Father
Pinasco was ordered to leave for (Santa
Clara College, where he took an act
! part in school work as professor and
j prefect, devoting himself unremittingly to
his charge until lStio, when he went to
Georgetown, Washington, to join the thep
| logical course then' in progress there for
I members of the Jesuit order aspiring to
I the priesthood. Ordained in 1870, he re
turned to Santa Clara College, where on
account of the great profici' ncy he had
made in the study of the English lan
' guage, he was deemed competent to teach
j rhetoric, at the same time acting as chap
lain and liilitrg the position of director of
the Prehistorian Debating Society.
The superiors, veil aware by this time
|of his special talent for government,
i transferred him to St. Ignatius College,
! San Francisco, where he was appointed
president, remaining in office, to the great
satisfaction of professors and pupils, until
1876, when he was placed at the head of
! Santa Clara College to' guide its destini^-i
until 1883, when he was succeeded by Rev.
R. E. Kenna. .:..;>.â¢
Having finished his term of presiding at
j Santa Clara College, :he was placed in
i charge of the class of rhetoric at Si.
I Ignatius College. S3n Francisco, and di
rected the gentlemen's sodali'y until the
end of the scholastic year, 1884, when he
was placed over the novices at Santa Clara
as instructor.
Again in 1888 he was at the head of af
fairs at Santa Clara College t governing
with that latherly kindness and affability
that ever characterized him and made for
him hosts of friends. At the end of his
second term of presidency at Santa Clara
College he acted as vice-president of St.
Ignatius College up to the summer of 1896,
when, on account of feeble health, physi
cians ordered a change to Los Gato.'.where
he resided until the time of his demise.

THE- CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL. f
THURSDAY MARCH 11, 1897
During the week ending Sat-
urday last THE CALL published
46 X S inches
of advertisements, which is
224: inches more
than was published by any other
San Francisco newspaper during
the same time.
The liar has been branded.
The hypocrite has been unmasked.
Honesty has been fully vindicated.
The Examiner is bound in its own prison
twine.
Legitimate journalism has had n tri
umph.
The next order of the Examiner for
convict-made goods will be copyrighted.
Perhaps Willie Hearst's order for San
Quentin twine was a privileged communi
cation.
Every package of the Examiner bound
in twine ought to be plainly marked:
'â¢Made in prison."
Willie Hearst's addre-s to the unem
ployed; "Go to San Quentin and get a
job on ike Examiner."
Long Green may be out of jail and stay
out for a while, but all the same the jail
will stay there and wait for him.
The Senate sbould have sent the Exami
ner gang to the jutemill where they could
have continued to work for Wiilie.
A si^n of the times: Juta
Mills, San Quentin. Subscribe for the
Faker and patronize home prisons."
Bound in the meshes of its convict
twine the faker is pilloried before union
labor and left to take the consequences.
Free labor seeks for work in San Fran
cisco, but the Examiner prefers to patron
ize convicts because they work cheaper.
By condemning disreputable fakers the
Senate has vindicated legitimate journal
ism and deserves the thanks of the press.
The next freak coupon will announce
"Convict twine given away with every
cony of the Examiner and a yard of pupÂ«
thrown in."
After ell it is only logical that the crim
inal stuff published by the Examiner
should be bound with twine made by
prison labor.
"The cuttle-fish darkens the path of its
retreat by excreting filth," says the Exami
ner, and then proceeds to show bow the
thing is done.
Remove the prison-made twine and the
fake disDatches from the Long Green news
paper and there would be nothing left
but a bad odor.
Now that the Hearst fortune has been
started to prison by Long Green Law
rence, how long will it be before the Wil
lie boy follows it?
The fellows in stripes in the San Quen
tin jutemill are not to blame for working
for the hypocritical absentee Hearst.
They can't help it.
Having dragged the unclean thing out
ol the public highway and thrown it into
jail, tlie Senators may now wash their
hands and resume business.
If Willie Hearst is as rich as he is re
ported to be, why is his Long Green man
ager a patron of convict labor while free
workingmen lack employment?
The only principle at stake between the
Legislature and the fakers is the vindica
tion of honesty, and that was done by ex
posing the lie and jailing the liar.
It has long been known that the Exam
iner is headed for San Quentih, but until
the exposure of yesterday it was not gen
erally known that much of its stuff came
from there.
The friend of free labor supports free
labor and by free labor docs he do his
work, but the enemy of free labor sup
ports the prisons and rejoices in the in
crease 01 convicts.
The Examiner's charge of bribery in aid
of thievery was made with a roar like a
lion, but il<> defense U something of a
cross between the bray of an ass and the
snarl of a cornered cur.
The members of the Senate who voted
against the imprisonment of the con
victed liar probably had no objection to
being charged with taking bribes in aid of
thievery. There is no accounting for
tastes.
The public libraries which nave ex
cluded the Examiner and the N-w York
Journal frbm their reading-rooms have set
an example which will soon be followed
everywhere. The unclean things must be
cast oat utterly.
It is in vain the liar whines about ''priv
ileged communications." When he pub
lished the charge of "Bribery in Aid of
Thievery" be made himself responsible,
and is rightly compelled to prove his
words in public or swallow them in jail.
THE "EXAMINER" JUTEMILL.
The manufacture of common twine at San Quentin is done in what is in reality if
not in name the Examiner jutemilJ. The only twine of a character similar to that made
by free labor and for sale in the open market which is manufactured at San Quentin is
manufactured for the Examiner by contract with Willie Hearst. No other consumer
of twine in the State uses the San Quentin article, which ci.mes into competition with
free labor. The manufacture of that twine at San Quentin is another of the Exam
iner's exclusives.
"The Examiner Jutemill, San Quentin." That should be the name written on
the building where the twine is made. The convicts who labor at spinning the twine
are working for the sole and exclusive use or the Examiner. Not another man in all
California obtains common twiue from that source. Every other industry which re
auires me use of twine of a sort that can be obtained in the general market patronizes
the product of free labor. The Examiner is absolutely the only customer and con
sumer of common twine made at San Quentin. The mill virtually, therefore, belong?
to the Examiner, and of right should bear the name of that facing, lying, hypocritical
and indecent newspaper.
There is something of more than ordinary significance in the fact that the Exam
iner, under the control of Long Green Lawrence, who acts as local manager for the
absentee Hearst, has at this juncture turned away from free labor to give its patron
age to convicts and to procure the use of prison machinery for the manufacture of the
goods which it needs. It is a sign of degeneracy in more ways than one.
The late Senator Hearst accumulated his large fortune by developing the resources
of California, upbuilding its industries and giving employment to its workingmen.
That fortune so honestly and honorably made is now used to build up prisons instead
of homes, to support convicts instead of workingmen and to bring into competition
with industries that employ free labor a newspaper that maintains its existence by
the cheap and unpaid labor which can be extorted from habitual criminals and from
those whom hard misfortune has led into crime and forced to prison.
The wrong done to the workingmen of San Francisco by the patronage extended
to convict labor by the Examiner goes much further than appears on the surface. What
has been exposed is but a sample of the iniquity which still remains bidden. There
is no telling to what extent and degree the Examiner throws the weight of its patron
cge and influence against the upbuilding of the home industries of San Francisco and
the welfare of its working people. The paper is known to be devoted to crimes and
criminals. It is possible mat much of the sensational stuff printed in it is written in
prisons. It is in every respect a convict sbeet, and when on tne prison house at San
Quentin there is written the words "Examiner Jute Mills," there should be written
on the office of the paper in this City 4l Prison-made Journal."
FALSEHOOD AND PRINCIPLE.
Convicted of lying and sentenced to jail for brazen effrontery in refusing to the
Senate the respect due to the highest legislative council in the State, Long Green Law
rence is endeavoring to create sympathy for himself by bo misrepresenting the case as
to mislead the public mind on the issue at stake. He seeks to pose as a martyr
in the cause of the liberty of the press. He speaks of himself as "a man of honor,"
and declares tbat he suffers imprisonment rather than betray a confidence reposed in
him.
The real issue is not that which Long Green Lawrence is trying to impose upon
the people. This is no question of privileged communication, nor of the right and
duty of an editor to maintain inviolate information which is given to him in confi
dence. It is the simple question whether a newspaper which libels, maligns, slanders,
calumniates and belies public men has a right not only to refuse to attempt a justifi
cation of the charge, but to refuse it with impudence and added insult.
In an editorial yesterday appealing to the press for support the Examiner says:
"Mr. Bryan says in his new book that of all the correspondents who accompanied him
during the late campaign not one ever published anything that was given in confi
dence. Mr. McKinley has said substantially the same thing." It is on these state*
ments that Long Green Lawrence bases his claim that he is acting in accordance with
the principles of legitimate journalism. It will be noted, however, that the newspa
per men of whom President McKinley and Mr. Bryan spoke did not "publish" wbat
was told them. The Examiner did publish what it asserts was told to its correspond
ent. It betrayed confidence to that extent, and by the betrayal has now put tbe
informant in the position where he must come forward and make himself known, or
else the editor who acted on that information must go to jail branded as a public
libeler and a common liar.
The only principle of legitimate journalism at stake in tbis issue is the principle of
tiuth-speakinjr. A legitimate newspaper when it receives information in confidence
aoes r.ot betray that confidence by publishing the information under circumstances
which either renders it a wrong to innocent people or else compels the confidential
friend to come forward and make his woids good or slink into obscurity a self-con
fessed coward and slanderer.
Andrew Lawrence will in vain appeal to the press for support or sympathy in his
present position. He has been sentenced to jail like a common criminal, and it i 3
to criminals alone that he must look for consolation. It is in vain that he coaxes
interviews from citizens to defend him as a representative of legitimate journalism
suffering martyrdom rather than to betray a confidence. He is not a legitimate
journalist. He has betrayed confidence. UÂ« is a facer, a liar, a malignant libeler, a
defamer of honest men, and he has been convicted ol these offenses.
Honest journalism knows well the principles on which it stands. It respects con
fidence, it honors every trust reposed in it. It does not publish wbat was not given
for publication. It does not slander the innocent. It does not seek to degrade the
State and bring a community into disrepute. Long Green Lawrence has long Eev
ered his connection wtth legitimate journalism, and it is too Jate for him to expect
sympathy from it now.
THE UNIVEESITY.
The report published in The Call yes
terday of the affairs of the university must
have been in the highest degree gratify
ing to all who take an interest in that in
stitution or even in the welfare of the
State It showed that the action recently
taken by tbe Legislature to advance the
university will be cordially supported by
tbe munificence of private citizens, and
that the university has truly entered upon
a new era in its career.
One of the notable features in the report
was the announcement tbat Levi Strauss
has duplicated the amount of money
which is to be set apart to aid worthy and
poor students from each of the Congres
sional districts of the State. The money
assigned for this purpose amounts to
$3500 a year. Mr. Strauss has added an
equal amount. The two toeether make
an important addition to the funds which
the university will provide for the educa
tion of young men and young women who
otherwise would bo deprived of that high
advantage.
Another generous citizen, James K.
Mofiit t, a graduate of the class of 18S6,
gives $100 for library uses and promises an
equal sum for similar purposes every year.
These ara but the beginning of the dona
tions which are coming in, and afford an
evidence of the willingness of generous
citizens to co-operate with the State in
upbuilding the university and making it
in every respect worthy not only of the
present condition of California but of its
golden future.
Another important feature of the report
of yesterday was the plan submitted by
Regent Arthur Rodgers for the creation
in the university of a college of commerce.
Such institutions exist in the great cities
of Europe and form an important part of
the education given by the Government.
A recent report of British manufacturers
on the comparative conditions of the for
eign trade of England and Germany
called attention to the effective aid given
to German commerce by the graduates of
these commercial schools, and declared
that until England provided a similar
course of instruction her manufacturers
would compete at a disadvantage with the
Germans in extending their trade in ior
ei?n countries.
It will be seen therefore that the pro
posed plan does not lacfc for good argu
ments in its favor. It will be well if the
Regents can see tbe way clear for the for
mation of such a college, inasmuch as we
shall need it to promote tbe trade of Cali
fornia with the Orient and with South
America in competition with the trained
students of commerce who go forth from
tbe schools of Europe.
Taking all things into consideration,
the outlook for tbe university is decidedly
good. The action of the Legislature in
increasing the revenues has stimulated
public Interest and given an impetus to
private generosity. The results will in
crease as the years go on, and in a com
paratively short time Berkeley will tmke
rank in buildings and equipment with
the foremost seats of learning in the
United States.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 11, 1897.
THE DEMOOEATIO CAUCUS.
According to reports from Washington,
a recent caucus of Democratic managers
resulted in nothing. This is in the high
est degree encouraging. It confirms the
reports heretofore sent out that there will
be no viruient opposition to the new tariff
bill and that tha extra session of Congress
will be able to perform the legislation so
necessary to the welfare of the country
with promptness and expedition.
It is certainly an act of wisdom on the
part of the Democratic leaders to attempt
no extreme opposition to the new tariff.
The Democrats are in the minority and
are divided among themselves. They
could not possibly impose any effective
opposition to the Republicans in the
Senate unless they could arrange for a
combination with the Populists and the
so-called silver Republicans. Such an
opposition would be of no credit to those
who made it, nor would it add any
strength to Democracy. It is not sur
prising to learn, therefore, that the astute
Senator Gorman counseled his colleagues
again - 1 it.
The futile result of the Democratic
caucus shows how impotent that once
strong party has become in National
affairs. It is, in fact, no longer an or
ganization. It has no policy on which it
is unite.t, and there are no measures of
importance beforo the country on which
it can agree. Some of the leading Demo
crats in the Senate are in favor of a pro
teotive tariff and would break away from
the parly if the majority attempted a
coalition with the Populists to cleleat the
proposed bill, and some of them are ex
treme gold-standard w?n and will favor
no sort of combination with the free-silver
Republicans.
Thus while the Republican party has
not an avowed majority in the Senate it
will be sufficiently strong to pass the bills
needed to provide protection for American
industry and ample revenues for the Gov
ernment. The McKinley administration
certainly begins under favorable auspices.
It- friends are united and its foes divided.
The country is with it, and what is more
it is thoroughly and consistently with the
country.
OAST THEM OUT.
Evidences have now been sriven that the
crusade against vicious journalism is pro
ducing good result?. The library at Port
land, Or., and that of Newark, N. J., have
excluded the most vicious examples of
decadent journalism from their reading
rooms. The movement, it will be seen,
extends from tbe Pacific to the Atlantic
coast, and we have there ore a proof that
the aroused indignation of the people is
not confined to any particular locality,
but is acting with equal force all over the
ct untry.
It is gratifying to learn that tbe action
taken by these libraries, one in excluding
the New York Journal and t c other
in excluding the San Francisco Ex
aminer from their reading-rooms, is cor
dially approved by the public as well as by
legitimate newspapers. It is clear the
denunciation of these foul and offensive
journals has been beneficial, inasmuch as
it has informed public opinion on the sub
ject and roused the people to the evil and
the danger of tolerating disreputable
journalism in American life.
The evils of decadent journalism are
many. In the rirst place Bucb papers are
a menaca to society by reason of their
vicious attacks upon the characters of
<_'ooii men aud women in private life. The
Examiner recently gave an example of this
vice in its attack upon Mrs. Cornelius
Vanderbilt, and a little while before by its
attack upon one of the leading families o.'
San Francisco. A second evil is the wrong
done to a community by the wholesale
slanders against men of public character
and the social organism at large. The
Examiner has furnished an illustration of
this offense in its recent charges against
the California Legislature and its efforts
to misrepresent our State Government as
being corrupt in every department. A
third evil is the perversion of public
morals by making crime sensational and
attractive to Hl-balancsd minds,, TnÂ«
Examiner has furnished many evidences
of this evil an i in its announcements for
the forthcoming Sunday edition promises
another in the chape of an elaborate and
sensational write-up of a child criminal.
It will be seen that the time has come
when society must take steps to protect
itself against these offensive, corrupting,
crime-loving and crime-producing news
papers. Men and women in high station
who, by reason of their attainments, wealth
or social positions, are shining marks for
slander, must act together for self-protec
tion a ainst the defamation of these
vicious journals. Institutions open to the
public, such as the great libraries of the
country, must rid their reading-rooms of
journals which tend to deprave the people,
lest they become the center of corruption
rather than of enlightenment. Officers of
the law must take action, lest these vicious
journals engender crime among thoÃe
whose minds are susceptible to the influ
ences of their sensational reports of the
doings of criminals.
The movement be^un on this coast by
the library at Portland, and in the
East by the library at Newark, will
soon be followed by other institu
tions of the kind in every part of
the Union. The crusade in the cause of

When Melba left the Metropolitan Opera
house Company, out of voice and sick at heart
with her non-success as Brunhilde, the man
agement put forward an American singer,
Mme. Clementine de Vere Snpio, to take her
place. Mme. SÂ«pio is a very fine artist, who
has been known for years to the concert world
of New York, but who has only recently come
to the front in opera. Her voice is very beau
tiful in quality and she uses it witn perfect
art, but she has tarried too long on the con
cert stage to be able to step into Melba's shoes
as a pritna donna. On the operatic Â«tage she
fails to carry conviction, as sne Roes through
a dramatic role as calmly and passively as if
she were rendering a ballad on the concert
platform. Her beautiful singing, however,
almost atones for her lack of temperament
Â«.nd there is every prospect that Mme. Clem
entine de Vere Sapio will remain one of the
operatic stars for some seasons to come.
Meanwhile, Melba has been confiding to the
MME. CLEMENTINE DE VERE SAPIO, the New American
Prima Donna.
press in Paris that she bears Jean de Reszke no
ill will for having induced her to appear in
the role of Brunhilde, for she does not believe
he did it in order to achieve her downfall.
Mme. Thea Dorre, who will be remembered
as the mezzo soprano of the Tavary Opera
Company, has recently been singing with
considerable success in Florence. Writing
from Milan to a personal friend In this
City she says: "Every one here is en
thusiastic about Frank belcher, a young San
Franciscan. He singa with such taste
that one would believe he had studied
here for years. He is going to make
an artist. It is refreshing to hear of a talented
American gentleman, who promises to be a
real success when he has finished studying, as
hitherto our men have all turned out to be
failures. We have some great American prima
donnas, but no tenors or barytones." Mr.
Belcher i 9 studying with Cima.
Mme. Dorre herseif is now singing the title
role in "Carmen" at the Dalverme Theater in
Milan. . It is a part in which she has always
excelled, but she speaks with even greater en
thusiasm of the role of Anita, in "La Navar
raise."
There has been a good deal of talk lately
about a day laborer in the arsenal at Venice
named Luigi Coccolo, who is trying to make
his debut as a composer. Although he has
never had any musical instruction, he has
studied alone, and has written two operas. A
committee was recently formed in Venice to
open a public subscription to defray the cost
of producing his works. "Tello l'Africano,"
au opera in two acts, can be produced for about
3000 francs, while the other opera, "Aldino
de Cittadelia," will cost at least 7000 francs to
produce. Although the committee has made
a very earnest appeal to the Italian public,
only 1000 francs have so far been raised.
The Metropolitan Opera Company will prob
ably regret its visit to Chicago, for it has been
receiving very Inadequate support there. The
absence of Melba and Eames has been urged
as an excuse, but this could not account for
"Carmen" and "Faust," with Calve as the
star, being very poorly attended. Some people
have beeu airing the opinion that if Nordica
had remained with the organization the
Schoeflel and Grau Company would have
been received with more consideration in
Chicago, but Nordica never was a great
drawing card when she sang with that
organization either in New York or Chicago,
and n is not likely that she could have
changed the feeling of the Windy City toward
the whole organization.

were born in Cornwall, Ei. gland.
Sheep Shearingâ Machine, Baden, Cal. It
is stated by wool men that sheep are not
shorn by machinery in the United States. It
is a practice in Australia. This department
has not been able to verify the assertion that
"James Powers of Queensland sheared 315
biieep in seven and a half hours."
Placer Countyâ c. E. R., Smartsville, Yuba
County. Cal. Placer County is in the Fourth
Internal Revenue District. That district is
divided from the First by the north line of San
Francisco, north line of San Joaquin, north
line of Calaveras and the west line oi Tuolumne
County.
Neutralâ S., City. As the United States has
no trouble with the principals in the Eastern
trouble at this time, a United States war ves
gel at anchor in a port near the scene of the
difficult? would not take an active part, but
would be on hand to receive American citi
zens who might be in danger.
Baiteryâ P. C, East Oakland, Cal. If a per
son desires to use an eleciric battery for
remedial purposes an acid or a dry battery
will answer the purpose, the choice depend

Oscar Wilde â Subscriber, City. The parents
of Oscar Wilde were Sir William Willis Wilde,

the Vigilance Committee of San Francisco at
"Fort Gunnybags" on Sacramento street, on
the 22d of May, 1856.
Dead Wiresâ H. 8., City. If there are any
wires running over the house you occupy they
are there undoubtedly by right of law. The
fact that they have not been used for a long
time does not give you a legal right to use
them. If they are "dead" find out who owns
them, and the probability is that you will ba
permitted to use them for a private line.
Witness Feesâ J. 8., City. There is no law
of the State oi California authorizing the pay
ment of witness fees in criminal cases, Dut f
a witness comes from a distance and it ap
pear* by affidavit or otherwise that he is poor
and is unable to bear the expense he has been
put to in coming to court to testify the court
may allow such witness the amount of his
actual expenses.

must bo numbered according to the provision
of the ordinances of the Board of Supervisors.
If a house is incorrectly numbered the number

Idaho and Utahâ A correspondent In a com
mun;cation says that the nickname of Idaho
is "Gem oi the Mountain," ana thnt the nick
name of Utah is "Mormon State," and quotes
an encyclopedia from which he obiained
these. As already announced in ibis depart
ment the recognized books do not give any
nicknames foi either of these States. The
"encyclopedia" quoted is evidently a little off
in its assertion. It has given the definition
of Idaho for a nickname. The name is Indian
and means "gem of the mountain. "Mormon
State," though not a popular name, is un
doubtedly correct.
AMile-E. R, Oakland, Cal. The ordinary
mile, or.statute mile, in the United States and
in Great .Britain is 1760 yards of three feet
each, equal to 5280 feet. A geographical or
nautical mile is (I) the mean length of a min
ute of latitude, equal to 0082 66 feet; (2) the
length of a minute of the meridian corre
sponding to the radius of the curvature of tha
particular latitude, varying from 6045 95 feet
at the equator to 6107.85 feet at the poles; (3)
the length -I â  minute of longitude on the
equator, 6087.15 teet. To remove all uncer
tainty the United fetates toast Survey has
adopted the value ot the nautical mile as
equal to one-sixtieth part of the length of a
degree on the great circ.e of a sphere whose
suriace is equal to the surface of the earth.
Th;svÂ»lue gives one naut.cal mile equal to
6080.27 feet, which i* very nenrly the value of

British Hydrograpnic office. One square mile

Fractional Currencyâ J. N., City. When
specie payment was suspended in January
1862, both silver and gold dignrpeared from
circulation. The place of subsidiary coin was
for a time supplied with tickets, due bills and
other forms of private oDligations. which were
issued by merchants, manufacturers and
others whose business requ red them to maku
change. Congress soon interfered and author
ized, first, tne use of postage stamps for
change; second, a modified lorm of postal
6tamp, called postal currency, and, finally,
fractional paper currency in denominations
corresponding to the subsidiary silver coins.
This department is unable to discover that
there ever were any "75-cent greenbacks
issued by the United States, and as the law
authorized the issue of "fractional paper cur
rency" in denominations corresponding to the
"subsidiary coins" and there being no 75-cent
pieces it is safe to say that no 75-cent green
backs were ever issued for general circulation.

opened the door of the Queen of England.
She laughingly gave me the desired permis

The Oil Steamer G orge Loomis Is
Slid to Bj the Most Perfect of
Her Class Afloat.
The tank steamer George Loomis arrived
from Ventura yesterday and anchored off
Meiggs wharf. This is the first time in
three months that she has failed to go
direct to the oil works, and there was
some comment over the fact, but the
matter was easily explained when it was
learned that the vessel whs going to Oak
land to discharge her cargo.
Several vessels were in the oil trade be
fore the George Loomis was built, but all
of them came to a sudden end. "Spon
taneous combustion" was the verdict, and
as no lives were lost there was very little
comment over the burning of the vessels.
The Loomis is especially adapted to the
trade. She has been built with all the
modern appliances and every safeguard
called for has been put aboard. The oil
tanks are hermetically sealed and the
connections between them and the engine
room are bulkueaded. Any leak in the
tanks is carried into the senppers and it
would only be by the remotest chance that
any of the overflow would cause damage.
The vessel is a good sea boat, and has
aiways made good time between here aud
the oil fields.
Frank Lemmons, a runner for the Cali
fornia Hotel, had a bad quarter of an
hour on board the steamer Oakland yes
terday. He paid his way across the bay,
and on the return trip began to "work the
passengers." The name of the hotel car
ried weight and he did well until Chief
Officer Higignson of the steamer put in
an appearance. The latter pointed out
that Lemmons was breaking the law
which prohibits soliciting on ferry-boats,
and then the trouble began. Lemmons
got abusive, and Hieginson was only pre
vented from active" hostilities by the in
tervention of the second mate and two
of the deckhands. When the Oakland
reached San Francisco Officer Charles
Callaghan was called in aud Lemmons
was placed under arrest on a charge of
disturbing the peace and vulgar langunge.
The people Lemmons was particularly
anxious to secure were the members o!
the French opera company, and it was
some of these who made the complaint to
the police; The cashier of the White
House will be one of the witnes-es against
Lemmons When the case is called in court
to-day.
George Fritch, the well-known coal mer
chant, came down from Coquille River on
the steam schooner Albion yesterday. He
had to be carried ashore and was com
pelled to move along on crutches to the
waiting carriage. While visiting the
mines he made a false step and fell about
thirty feet. The result was a sprained
ankle, which will probably keep him in
bed for several weeks^ Mr. Frilch is one
of the most popular men on the water
front, and his many friends were in evi
dence around the office on East street yes
terday.
The British ship Biairgowrie, which left
here on December 2 with a cargo of whtat,
has made the DannÂ«r run of the year.
Her sister ship, tne Blairhoyle, which left
here on December 5, was beaten by two
days. So both must have encountered
very favorable winds.
The two vessels sailed from this port for
Sydney, N. S. W., and in a private letter
to a friend in this City the captain of the
Blaiigowrie said that he never had a voy
age in which the circumstances were so
fisvorable. In the meantime the Blair
mere, a sister, ship to the two named, is
tied ud in Oakland Creek awaiting the
decision of the Board of Underwriters.
Since she was raised from the depihsof
Mission Bay the Blairmore has not earned
a cent of money for her owners, wliiiw the
Blair?owrie arid Blairhoyle have been
Disking quick passages and money for
their owners. The latter vessel was
loaded with flour, and as both wheat and
flour were in demand in New Foutli Wales
the shippers did even better than the
owners of the vessels.
T c tng Golden Gate is again in com

with the fishing fleet and will bring in the
catch of the sailing boats in Drake's Bay
and nearby Doiiits.

other hunting cruise, will not go into
commission. She will probably go back
to her old r.ncnontge to-morrow, as the
charterers do not think the prospects war
rant the expenditure of the money it
would cost to fit her out.
The tugboat men are wroth with the
observers at Point Reyes. They say that
time and a-ain they have been fooled on
information sent from that point, and are
now determined to enter a vigorous pro
test. Monday last a "sauare rigeer" was
reported "bound south," ana the "red
stack" company sent out the Sea Witch
and the "black stacks" the Active. After
a twenty-five-mile chase the tugboat men
discovered that the "square rigger" was
the Glory of the Sens, bound for Puget
Sound. Hence the trouble.

THE STORY OF
IRELAND'S WRONGS
As Recounted by the "Pa
triot Priest of Gwee
dore."
Metropolitan Hall Well Filled
to Hear Rev. Father
McFaiden.
The History of the System of Cosrcion
es Practiced by the Dominant
Partner.
Rev. James McFadden, "the patriot
priest of Gw6edore," made hisdebut bsfore
a San Francisco audience at Metropolitan
Hall last night, when he delivered an in
teresting and eicquent address on the
subject of Ireland and her wrongs.
The hall, very appropriately decorated
for the occasion, was well filled, and the
enthusiasm evoked by the speaker's forci
ble periods was general and spontaneous.
The platform was shared by the orator of
the evening, the chairman, Jeremiah
Deasy, and many well-known representa
tives of the local priesthood.
Several spirited selections by the Sacred
Heart College band opened the proceed
ings.
Mr. Deasy in a brief introductory aa
dress said tbat they were there assembled
that evening to show their appreciation
for a patriotic Irish priest, Rev. Father
MacFdden, who during the land league
troubles in Ireland was several times im
prisoned by the English Government for
i, is ODDoaition to oppressive measures.
But imprisonment was no Dadge of
ignominy in those days, when among
other patriots who snared the fate of
Father McFadden was one of the ereat
est of Ireland's sons â Charles Stewart
ParnalL
The following musical selections, which
were encored aimost without exception,
preceded the delivery of Father Mc-
Fadden' s address:
Song, "Oh, Where's the Slave So Lowly"
(Moore), Mr. Woods; vocal solo, Miss Mamie
i Burns; fancy dance, Miss Alicia Nolan; so
prano solo. Miss N. C. Kirby ; vocal soio, J. Mc-
I Au.iffs; selections, mandolin club, the Mi-ses
Baker, the Misses Johnson, the Misses Devlin
and Miss Mamie Grennati; .selections, Sacred
Heart Coik'ge imi.il; fancy dance. Master Ar
nold Grazer; recitation, Miss Anna Daly ; song,
Mr. Madden; "Ciod Save Ireland," audience,
standing.
Father McFadden was enthusiastically
applauded on rising. " 'Let cravens crawl
and tyrants hiss,' ue quoted, " 'and foes
look on deli^nted; to one aud all I would
answer thisâ we are wronged and must be
righted.' "
"Ladies and gentlemen," said he, "the
Almighty never intended the union of
Ireland and England, otherwise he would
never Dave created the lrisih Sea between.
[Laughter.] As it is said in a different con
nection, ' \Vii:iL God has joined let no man
senarate,' so we may ?ay in tbis case,
'What God has separated let no man
join.'
"The first invasion of England was sus
tained by violence, and ever since she has
held her sway Dy brute force. England
has distinguished herself among nations
by perpetually annexing to her dominions
places that are weak and incapable of con
ducting a war against ber.
"When she entered the field against the,
United States, we know how very rapidly
shf had to climb down, and now she kow
tows to you in order that no warlike un
dertakings may be threatened against
her."
lie argued that the racial differences be
tween the two nations made union impos
sible. Th.c hislorv of England's rule of
Ireland was a history written in tears and
blood. Ever since the so-called union se
cured by bribery and corruption England
had not dealt with Ireland constitution
ally, but had maintained her power at the
point of the bayonet. Nearly Â«very year
of the ninety years which had elapsed
since the union hnd seen the enactment
of some coercive measure. Under Balfour
and the.last Tory administration the con
ditions were sucu that no man dared
make known his views concerning the re
lations between landlord and tenant.
The speaker described the conditions
existing when he joined tho parish of
Gweedore. He made a determined stand
against the tyranny of the landlords and
did his best to intervene between the lat
ter and their tenants. But in soite of
famine and penury the landlords invari
ably refused to ssbate a penny of| their
claims for judgment. This agrarian
struggle finally resulted in partial inde
pendence and now they were in a position
to dictate terms 10 the landlord. [Cheers.]
The speaker aroused considerable in
lerest and amusement by his recital of
the fact? leading up to his own arrest and
imprisonment.
The jail in which the speaker was con
fined measured 7 feet wide and 9 feet
lons and resembled a tunnel with an
arched roof.
He was arrested again soon after his re
lease. The officer intrusted with the exe
cution of the warrant swore that he would
take McFaddeu at 4 o'clock, dead or
alive.
Before 4 o'clock McFadden was arrested
alive, but the officer was dead, the victim
of the fury of the priest's parishioners,
who thought that he sought to injure
McFalden jihvsically.
In conclusion tne speaker described the
system of terrorism invented by the Gov
ernment, the packing and bribing of juries
and the subornation of witnesses. The
, restoration of the Liberal administration
had brought about amelioration, and now
comparative peace and prosperity reigned
at Gweedore.
LE ROY HARVEY'S DEAL.
Mrs Emily A. P. *imth Compromises
* a Suit for 56760 With the
Grangers' Bank.
The suit of the Grangers' Bank of Cali
fornia against Emily A. P. Smith for
$6760 haÃ been dismissed.
It is understood that a compromise was
reached.
"When the ca=e was called for trial in
Judce Bahrs' court both sides answered
ready and one whole day was devoted to
the taking of testimony. The pleadings
were in themselves quite interesting.
Mrs. Smith in her answer denied that
she by her agent, Le Roy G. Harvey, or
otherwise or at all made or execute J or
delivered to the plaintiff or to any one
any such note as is set forth in the com
plaint.
The complaint showed that the notes
were signed "Emily A P. Smith, per Le
Roy G. Harvey, attorney in /act." Con
cerning this Mrs. Smith, the defendant,
said :
The said defendant is further Informed ana
verily believes, and upon and according to her
information and b?li<-f avers, one Le Roy (J.
Harvey executed and delivered to the plain
herein that certain paper, writing or note
alleged in the complaint, but that it was
made and delivered without her authority,
consent or knowledge, and was without : ny
consideration whatever, ns the bank th' n arid
there well knew, and she verily believes that
the bank at all limes whs and still is the true
payee and the real party in interest, for whose
benefit the note was made.
The notes were drawn in favor of the
cashier of the bank and were by him in
dorsed and made pay.. to the bank.
From the trend of the first day's testi
mony it became clear that Mrs. Smith
would try to prove that the notes were
made by Harvey to settle his personal in
debtedness to the bank and that they
knew she was not a party in interest. Not
withstanding these facts a valuable piece
of real estate at the northeast corner of
Jackson and Webster streets, in this City,
belonging to Mrs. Smith and her daugh
ter, Maude A. Smith, was attached by the
Sheriff by direction of the bank. Â
SIERP FOLLOWS DURRANT.
The Latter* <> 1m it*- Will Go to San
Ouentlu for 1 wenty-Five
Voarj.
Again has the Supreme Court distin
guished itself and again does discomfort
reign in the cellmate of Theodore Dur
rant. This time me decision of the lower
court in the case of Wiiiiam Sierp, Dur
rnnt's cellmate, is affirmed, and he will go
to San Quentin for twenty-five years for
murder in the second degree.
The crime for which Sierp will pay this
penalty is the murder of Manuel Moreno,
an Italian fruitvender, whom the con
victed man shot and stabbed in Hinck:cy
alley.
His attorneys appealed the case uron
the ground that certain evidence was ad
mitted in the form of a deposition, the dy
ing statement of the murdered man. They
took the position t tint the State law does
not admit the introduction of a deposition
in a murder case. The Supreme Court
thought otherwise, as it was made in the
shadow of impending death.
This decision leave Durrant without a
celimnte. To Sierp Durrant is a famous
personage, and the two men have grown
to be fast friends. Durrani's friendship is,
in part, due to the fact tliat Sierp does
most of the housework and other similar
favors.
A PAULIST f ATHER SPOKE.
Betrayal of Christ Discusiert by Rev.
Father Powpii at St. afar.y'g Churcli.
Old St. Mary's Churcli, cornerof Califor
nia and Dupont streets, the headquarters
ol the Paulist Fathers, was well filled last
night by a congregation assemb'ed lo hear
a lecture by Rev. Father C. J. Powers.
The snbj.ct was "The Betrayal of
Christ" and the text was, "They weighed
for my wage? thirty pieces of silver." â
Zacharias xi:l2.
During bis discourse and in substance
he said :
A week ago we watched in spirit the agony
of Jesus Christ. We saw him prone upon the
ground Deueath the olives ol Geth^emane.
We beheld his dejection, his sorrow, his an
guish of soul, his utter abandonment. We
heard his prayer that if it were possible his
chalice of bitterness might pass away from him,
but we knew that it was sin that had made
that chalice bitter, knew that he suffered for
our transgressions.
We saw him atoning by his obedience for
our many disobediences. We trembled as we
beheld him draining that cup to tne very last
drop. While his soul seemed breaking from
ins body, while we almost feared to look upon
him in his unspeakable misery, we beheld him
shining in the ruby brightness of his precious
blood and an angel from heaven strengthen
ing him.
To-nijtht in the same garden we shall wit
ness his betrayal. In that band that came
upon him are .lews of every rank and condi
tion, of every sect an<l opinion. All differences
seem forgotten lv the eagerness to keep toward
the head of the motley procession. Here are
officers ot the Sanhedrim, here guards of the
temple, here servingmen of the high priest.
And for once Roman and Jew are in accord
for here, too, are Roman legionaries, a tribune
and the soldiers of his cohort. And herein
tne foremost rank cf (his troop of Jew and
gentile walks one of the twelve, Judas Iscariot.
"Judas Iscariot. what dost thou here?" The
voice of the prophet answers: "They have
weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver."
"Judas Iscariot. apostle of Christ, what dost
thou here?" The voice of him once an apostle
replies: "Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he;
that is he; take hold of him and lead him
away."
Judas Iscariot has been bought. His avarice
has betray* d him. For sordid gain he has
sold ins friend, his master, his God, even his
own immortal soul.
Voflrae Held for Trial.
Dennis Vodrae, the quartermaster of the
steamer Acapulco, who was detected trying to
smuggle twenty-eight tins of opium into this
port in the false bottom of his trunk, was held
lor trial by United States Commissioner Hea
cock yesterday in $1000 bonds. Vodrae ad
mitted that the opium was his, but slated that

to his bed for some time vast.
It was decided to appoint the following
speakers for the mass- meeting: W. S.
Barnes, Samuel M. Shortridge, Colonel
Eddy. Patrick Redly and W. \V. Foote.
One thing that Mr. McCue set forth that
elicited attention was that the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific and North Pacific
Coast roaiis were running trains out of
San Rafael and boats out of San Francisco
iat about the same time. Ha claimed they
ought to alternate, and said they could
give as good service in this way with half
, the trip.-.
He also held that the cost of running
would be only half, and that therefore the
fare oueht !o be reduced one-half. He
q loted figures which be alleged showed
(Oat commuters had paid the interest on
the railway bonds. He said, too, that the
round trip rate to Corte Madcra, twelve
: miles from San Francisco, was the same
I as the r;ite to San Quentin, a distance of
' twenty-two miles. He argued that it
ought :o be made one-half.
On Monday night next the Cuban
League, the original organization of
Cuban sympathizers in this City, will

JAPANESE COUNTS
AS APPRENTICES
Four Young Noblemen on
the British Ship
Grenada.
Learning to Be Sailors So That
They May Become
Commanders.
The Peter Deniston Lne of English
Ships Employ Only G r
mai Captains.
The British four- masted ship Grenada,
now lying at section 2 of the seawall, en
joys the unique distinction of numbering
among her crew four young men who are
ol noble birth and whu wilt at some
future time each be known by the title of
count. Nor are they British subjects
either. They owe their allegiance to the
ruler of Nippon, the Mikado of Japan.
Some years ago the fathers of the young
mariners, who stand hi.h in the councils
of the Japanese nation, decided that it
would be a good plan to have their heirs
become sailors, that they might be a
credit to their country at a time when the
land of the chrysanthemum should be
come a great maritime power. So the
owners ot the Peter Denis'on line of
British iron vessels was applied to, and
for a consideration the embryo com
manders were shipped as apprentices.
Those now on the Grenada are Denkicki
Mori, Satkichi Toganii and Dogi Hagino.
Reystaro Takeda was also formerly an
apprentice on the Grenada, but has been
transferred to the Socotro, another ship of
the same line. All of theyoun^' Japanese
are developing into smart sailors and ex
pect to command ships of their own within
a few years. Captain Korff says thit they
are well behaved and obedient and as
good men as he would care to handle.
The Peter Deniston iine of ship.-s which
comprises the Grenada, Australia, tfocotro
and two others, en joy a another distinction
in that it is the oniy*BritiÂ«h line in which
all of the captains are Germans. Each
vessel carries four mates, and these in
almost every instance are al^o Germans.
This fact is accounted for by the cir
cumstance that wriile the vessels fly the
British flag and are under Enelish register
the larger portion of the btotk of the com
pany to which they belong is held in Ham
burg and other cities in Germany.
The Grenada arrived here on November
12 last, just too iate to save a splendid
charter that would have netted her owners
much money. She came here under
charter at 27 shillings, but as she came
r.head of time her owners did not allow her
to enter port but sent her north for a
cargo of coal, trusting to get her back in
time to take the car.o for which she had
been chartered.
Bad weather prevented her from getting
in on time, and the charter lapsed. She
has been idle ever since, and has just ac
cepted a charter for Liverpool at 15 shil
lings. She goes to Port Costa, to load coal,
this alternoon.

August Anderson, an seed shoemaker,
died at the City and County Hospital at 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon. His death,
the hospital physicians allege, was due to
consumption, but friends of the deceased
claim otherwise.
On December 1 Anderson and a butcher
named Michael Connay came to blows in
a saloon, and when the combatants were
separated it was found that Anderson had
sustained a fracture of the jaw.
He was removed to his home and a
physician summoned, but after a few days
he was removed to the City and County
Hospital. The old man slowly weakened,
and yesterday afternoon he died. Al
though ot the belief that consumption
was the cause of rteath, the hospital physi
cians considered the fracturÂ»a jaw, ar.a
had the body removed to the Morgue, that
an inquest might, be held.
Connay will be arrested and held pend
ing the verdict of the Coroner's jury.
Kicked by a HorseÂ«
Diedrlck Seegelken, a canvasser living at
2233 Geary street, was kicked by a horse he
was driving at Ocean View yesterday after
noon and sustained a compound fracture of
the right lei?. He was taken to the City and
County Hospital and Dr. Dudley attended to
the injured member.

FOR VETERANS
Salinas Preparing for the
Encamrnmt of Old
Soldiers.
Grand Welcome to Bs Given to
the Men Who Fought for
the Flag
Committees Hard at Work to Insure
a Season of Pieasure for
the Visitors.
SALINAS, Cal., March 10.â Thii beau
tiful and thriving little city in astir with
the business of arranging a grand enter
tainment for the Grand Army of the Re
public in April. The brave soldiers who
fought that the flag might be free will re
ceive a royal welcome here. Sympathetic
ears will listen to the old heroes as they
recount stories of the ramp and field.
When memories of the Wilderness, Get
tysburg and Antietam are recalled they
will strike responsive chords in the hearts
nf the multitude here, for even the school
children are preparing to listen and wel
come the brave remnant that fought and
saved the Union.
Salinas has been chosen as the site of
the thirteenth annual encampment of the
Department of California and Nevada,
Grand Army of the Republic, and tnera ia
an atmosphere of preparation among all
ranks and conditions of the people. The
encampment of honored guests wiil con
vene in the opera-house at 2:30 p. M. on
Wednesday, April 21, and the eood rcen
and women of Salinas will do their utmost
during tlie remainder of that week to
make the eld heroes happy and leave in
tueir memories Beautiful pictures of Sali
nas' hospitality.
There seems to be an ambition here to
Bnri aÂ«s the hospitality that tbe people of
eanta Cruz extended to the encampment
last year. The entire population feels the
impulse of new growth and realizes that
this is to be a stirring city of considerable
commercial importance and the people
wr.nt to show visitors that their welcome
h a- genial as the balmy clime, their hos
pitality as beautiful as the picturesque
mountains in the panoramic background.
The encampment will be a great success
because the oid so.diers want to come and
because everybody here is anxious to make
it go. The citizens have gone at their
â work in a thorough, businesslike way.
The fa'rst thing they did was to appoint a
strong commiitee of representative citi
zens to direct matter?. This body began
work at once and its labors have gone on
irom the outset with unabated vigor. Un
flagging zeal characterizes all that it does
and the names of the men in charge are a
guaranty that their plans cannot fail.
Such men as H. S. Bill, J. G. Joy, L. H.
Garrigu*, W. H. Clark, G. A. Daugherty
ami Harry Win ham a* ch.ef workers in
sure ihe success of aa.v undertaking for
the public good. All o! these and many
others serving on various commute s are
working in unison to make ;he event suc
cessful. When the visitors arrive they
will hnd the town beautifully decorated
with flags and bunting, while the people
will give them sue > a welcome as has
n<-ver been surpassed.
One of the most active men in carrying
forward the pieparalions for the encanip
mei:t is J. G. Joy, cornniatider of Steed
man Post, G. A. X., who served in Com
pany E of tne Second Maine Volunteer In
fantry, ile is abiy spconded in li 1-s efforts
by Captain M, J. Burke of Troop C, Cali
fornia National Gaard. Those men and
those aiding on the various committees
are extended great assistance by businesi
men and by the rank and tile ot patriotic
lit zens in general. '
The town will oe full of strangers during
the week of the encampment. Letters are
coming from various parts of the State
which show that great interest is mani
fested in this year's encampment. It is a
conservative estimate that there will be
from 500 to 700 members of the G. A. R.
here during the week of the festivities.
It is also probable that ti:ere will be sev
eral hundred who are not members of the
G. A. R. 1 here will be several hundred
ladies and oilier members of soldiers'
families, as well as many visitors who will
come for a holiday.
Fur the benefit of old soldiers through
out the State, it may ba well to give a
Slight forecast of the programme of the
week. Encampment headquarters will
close in San Francisco, April 20, and will
on that day be removed to the Abbott
Hotel here.
The committee on credentials will meet
at the opera-house immediately on the
adjournment of the Wednesday session of
the encampment.
The commander of General Jame& B.
Steedman J'o=t No. 56 will furnish a de
tail for guard duty during each day of the
festival. This will consist of the officers
of tho day, officer of the guard and four
comrades under arms.
Rate? of fare by rail from San Fran
cisco and other points interested will be
one and a third of the regular rates lor
the round trip, no stopover being allowed.
Hotel rates here will not be higher than
the usual prices of $1 to $2 per day. Beds
at residences will oe charged for at' the
rate of 50 cents per night, while meals at
restaurants may be secured for 25 cents
and up as per bill of fare. : ,';,* : \[
A grand parade and review will take
place Thursday morninc. the column
moving at 10 o'clock. It is b9lieved that
this will be the greatest spectacular event
of this character that has ever been seen
in. the valley. ;
Full details of the entertainment of
guests have not yet been arranged, but it
is certain that there will be splendid mu
sical and literary entertainment, ample
banquets and all that goes to make life
pleasant. In a general way tÂ»ie pro
gramme for the week is as follows; Mem-
(day, 2:30 p. m., opening of encampment;
i Wednesday evenin-j;, general reception;
Thursday morning, parade; evening, mu
sical and literary entertainment at the
'opera-house; Friday morning, business
j session; evening, oanquet at Armory Hail,
! for all visitors.
Secretary \V. H. Clark of the executive
j committee is one of the typical old sol
i diers here. Perhaps no man was ever
! much more shattered by shot and shell.
He is one of tne hardest workers for the
success of the encampment. Mr. Clark
was a private in the Ninety-second Regi
ment of New York Volunteer.-' and was in
I Casey's famous division at ihe battle of
: Seven Pine?, Va., May 31, 1862, where he
. was severely wounded in the lefr hip by
a musket bull, by a buckshot in the ri^ht
i side and in the back by the fragments of
j a shell. He lay on the field until sun
| down of the next day, when he was cap
j tured and pat into Libby Prison Hospital,
then on Belle Island, till exchanged in
August. Mr. Clark is hale to-day and will
enliven the encampment with some good
stories of battle.
Commander J. G. Joy is another veteran
with a long record for bravery. He was
in the Second and also in the Thirty-first
Maine Volunteer Infantry and took part
in many great engagements where bullets
fell around him like hail.
The various committees having the cele
bration in charge are busy every day ar
ranging details. The executive committee
was selected with great care, and consists
of men of high standing, irrespective of
whether they are members of the G. A. R.
The full committee is as follows: Mayor
i Harris, W:liam Vanderhurst, Vv\ H.
' Clark, R. L. Porter, Professor A. 0. Barker,
! James H. MiPoughall, James B. Iverson,
' G. A. l);iueheri}\ Charles France, F 11.

W. J. Hill, editor and proprietor of the
Salinas Citizens Who Ar2 Preparing for the Veterans* Coming.
Index, is a very enthusiastic worker for
tbe success of the encampment. The Owl
and Journal have also done good work.
In fact, newspapers, committees and cit
izens in general, including the ladies, are
doing all in their power to make the com
ing of the encampment a great success.
The orator of tho day lias not yet been se
lected, but it is probable that the commit
tee will succeed in getting some one of
known reputation from San Francisco or
Los Angeles. It is apparent to the most
casual observer that the thirteenth an
nual encampment will be a success in
every deta:i, if the energy and patriotism
of the energetic people of this thriving
little city can brine success out of hopes
that are now golden and efforts that are
unabating in the cause nearest their
hearts.

SAN DIEGO, Cat,., , March 10.â The
j California Mortgage Loan and Trust Com-
I pany made a voluntary assignment this
evening for the benefit of creditors, with
out preferences. The liabilities are $203,

real estate guaranteed by the company.
The assets are $280,000, consisting almost
entirely of real estate.
Mr. Swayne said this evening: "There
is no prospect of loss to any creditor.
The company has ample property to more
than pay all its debt*, even at the present
depreciated value?. The failure was caused
by continued depression in realty and ut

SENATOR DOLPH'S
SUDDEN DEATH
I Widespread Grief to the
North, "Where Rolls
the Oregon."
He Favored Amputation of a Leg
With One Chance in Ten
to Survive.
Sketch of the Career of a Member of
Congress Who Brou;ht His State
Prominence.
PORTLAND, Or., March 10.â Joseph
N. Dolph, ex-United States Senator, died
at his home in this city this morning at
10:50 o'clock, after an illness of about
two weeks. His death was caused by the
shock following the amputation of his
left leg, which operation was performed
last Mori 'lay afternoon.
For years Mr. Dolph has been suffering
from diabetis, ani his life has been pro
longed only by the extraordinary care he
has taken of himself, together with great
self-denial in the matter of diet. It has
been noticed for the last year that he was
beginning to fail, but he was able to be
about until two weeks ago, when he was
forced to confine himself to his house.
Even then his illness was not supposed to
be serious, but while at home he became
troubled with an ingrowing toenail on the
left foot. He caused this to De operated
upon, and a few days afterward blood
poisoning was manifested. The entire
left leg below the knoe became affected,
and, owing to the impoverished condition
of his blocd and general weakness, its pro
gress could not be stayed.
Asa last resort amputation was decided
upon. Mr. Dolph gave his consent, not
withstanding the fact that he was told
that ho had but one chance in ten to sur
vive. Alter the amputation he raliied for
a day or two, but early this morning he
began to s nk into death.
Funeral ceremonies are now being con
isdered by Masonic, Odd Fellows and
other orders to which he belonged, and
will take place next Friday afternoon.
A general feeling of sorrow was mani
fested in this city over the death of Mr.
Dolph. The prominence he has taken in
National nffairs gained for him at home
the respect and admiration of evory one,
K-gardless of politics. Flags on all public
buildings were displayed at half-mast this
afternoon.
Ex-Senator Dolpb was born in New
York State In 1836 and came to Portland
in 18(51, at once engaging in the practice
of law, in which he was very successful.
He wns early recognized as being girted
with brilliant professional attainments,
a logical mind and a strong character.
Mr. Dolph soon identified himself with
the politics of this State and during the
days uf the reb.-llion he was a stanch,
uncompromising Republican.
In 1882 he was elected to the United
THE LATE SENATOR JOSEPH N. DOLPH OF OREGON.
Sates Senate from this State, makine r.
spiendid record for himself not only in
the Senate but also in the United States
Supreme Court, where on frequent oc
casions he practiced during his twelve
years' residence in Washington City. He
was a warm personal friend of ex-Presi
dent Harrison and during the latter's
administration Senator Dolph was the
most prominently spoken ot as Justice
Field's successor on the United States
Supreme bench, the Justice's resignation
being expected at that time.
Two years aeo the ex-Senator was de
fented for re-election. Since then he re
sumed his residence here, but while he
woul>l not confess to his disappointment
his defeat aggravated the disease, diabetis,
from which he suffered for more tnan a
dozen years. Some months ago he was ap
pointed receiver of the Portland Savings
Bank.
ALVISO SLOUGH'S MYSTERY.
Stories of Hermit Rodman's Hidden Wealth
Still Being Heard in a San
Jose Court
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aiarch 10.â Farther j
testimony was taken to-day before Jud c j
Hyland in regard to the wealth of Charles
F. Rodman, tbe old hermit who was found,
dead in an ark on the Alviso Slough, last
September.
Mrs. Jules Pelle and James Brown said
they had heard all sorts ot stories about
the finding of the old recluse's wealth, but
they had seen none of the money nor knew
anything definite abo at the matter.
Ed Salvage testified to having a conver- j
sation with Emory in which he said he '
had $8000. He showed the witness at two i
different times two different $1000 United ;
States bonds, and when Emory returned i
from the East he accused the witness and i
others of stealing some money he left in
the ark.
George Emory was again put on the
stand. He said he tried to cash the bond
in San Francisco and San Jose but no
where else. When he went East he de
posited it in a Boston bank. Tbe witness
: could not remember telling of the inc
j dent of Ju-tice Bradley pocketing some
I papers, ana said in that regard, "'I had
| been drinking, and if it is so I am not
I aware of it."
Xâ K â  â â â  rr denied seeing the belt with
f it.uO in it and secreting it while searching
the boat. "It was a case of grab," he saidl
"when the Coroner got there and we al, j
wanted to get something. I was pulling j
, one end of an anchor chain and somebody ,
was on t he other, but ihe Coroner stonpea j
us. The guns ot the old man were old j
and rusty. We brought those to Jules ;
Pelle's saloon for a curiosity. I bought j
tbe boat for the chain and anchor, and
â  wtien the crowd went away Beard and I !
were the last. That's when we found the â 
I JlfiOO. We felt so funny we didn't count'
I it."
A clerk from the Union Bank wai
brought into court, and he testified that
Emory had $500 on deposit there, for
which a letter of credit had been issued.
It was asreed to between Emory, Coro
ner Secord and District Attorney Herring
ton to send the bond in Emory's posses
sion that was found in the ark East, ana
if it Is good steps will be taken by the
.Public Administrator to recover it.
BRIGHT CJluM' VKOSPBCTB.
Condition* Were Merer Better in Santa
Clara County.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 10. â Never
before were the prospects so bright for
largo crops of all kinds in Santa Clara
County. Although it is a little too early
to ?stimate the fruit crop, the indications
at the present time are that yields of all
kinds of fruits will be immense, and
unless something unforeseen happens,
should exceed the famous big crop in 1893.
The buds on the trees are well set. The
rainfall, nearly fourteen inches, has been
well distributed, and the only damage
that can be done is from frosts. Moorpark
apricots, which only beer well about evory
third year, promise a large crop. The
dried fruit crop of 1896 has about all gone
forward, and the fruit market was never
in a better condition than at present to
receive a large crop.'
The vineyards are looking well, and a
large yield of grapes with prospects of an
increased price for the vintage is looked
for. The acreage devoted to wheat and
barley this year is greater than for several
years past. The grain is up and looking
well. The hay crop will be large.
Captain Sennrtt't Will.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 10.â The will
of the late Captain James Sennett, the
well-known navigator and pilot, who died
at his home near Santa Clara on March 4,
was tiled for probate by Selina Sjnnett,
his widow, to-day. The estate is valued
at $25,000. It consists of $11,000 in a San
Francisco bank, stocks and bonus valued
at $SCOO, and a stevedoring plant in San
Francisco worth $7500. The widow is the
Mj!e devisee.

FRESNO LINEMAN'S FATE.
Killed by Contact With a Live Wire While
Working at the Top of
a Pole.
FRESNO, Cal., March 10.â Albert A.
Smitn, a lineman in the employ of the
San Joaquin Electric Company, was killed
yesterday afternoon while working on
tbe wires about three miles northeast of
this city, The wires were those which
conduct the current from the powerhouse
in the mountains to Fresno. It was sup
posed that the wires on which the line
man met his death were "dead," and they
had been so during the entire day. How
tliev became charged and death-dealing
has not yet been ascertained, but the sup
position is that some miscreant had
thrown a wire across the stringed lines,
thereby conducting the current from the
"live"to the "dead" wires.
Smith w;is working on tnree wires all
day. About 3 o'clock in the afternoon hrs
assistant, Francis, who was just starting
to ciimb another pole, saw that Smith's
clothing was on lire. His body had fallen
across another wire and was s-moking and
burning. Francis called for help, but see
ing that nothing could be done as long as
the wires were charged, he jumped into a
carriage and drove with all possible haste
j to the Barton vineyard and telephoned to
j the substation in this city to have all the
; currents turned off. This was quickly
j none, but too late to save the life of the
! unfortunate iineman.
A:ter Francis fltarted for the Barton
residence a negro and a Portuguese who
were working near by ran over to the pole
at the top of which Smith was perched.
They say that Sniitii revived and begged
iheni to help him.
"Is it possible," he pleaded, "that you
will let me burn to death and not try to
help me? '
He suggested that the negro get a lad
der, but the latter did not know where to
get one. The negro says he told Smith to
try to climb down. Smith did this and
raised himself up. Then he fell across the
wire again and was killed.
Smith was about 28 years of age. He
came from Denver, Colo., a few months
ago. The Coroner's jury returned a ver
dict that he came to his death accidentally
Irom coming into contact with a live
electric wire.
STOCKTON WOMAN'S BRAVERY.
Gives Chase 10 a Burglar and Succeeds
in Effecting His Cap
ture.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 10.â Mrs. Ar
thur Cornwall, the proprietress of a pri
vate boarding-house on Miner avenue,
â¢had an exciting experience with a burglar
yesterday, t-he and a young lady who
boards with her left the house shortly be
fore 3 o'clock, locking every door, even in
cluding those between the various rooms
downstairs. When they returned an hour
later her companion went upstairs to her
room and found a man standiug in front
of the bureau, the drawers of which had
been pulled out and their contents turued
topsy-turvy.
"There's a man here!" screamed the
young lady.
"I'll tell you all about how I came to be
here," said the fellow, advancing toward
her and pushing past to the stairway.
Mrs. Cornwall haa heard the' outcry
and was at ihe foot of the stairs. "You're
a thief," she exclaimed.
As the man started to push past she
seized him, calling out to her companion
to assist in searching him. He drew a le
volver, leveled it at Mrs. Cornwall and de
manded to be allowed to go. Sue threw
open the front door, at ttie same time tell
ing her companion to telephone the police
while she would follow tne man. This
she did. He broke and ran, but Mrs.
Cornwall was close after him. He was
forced to jump into a yard after a race of
a block, and this was the cause of his
capture.
Police Captain Simnson was soon in the
chase, with Chief of Police Kingsbury and
Officers Kahn and GUI. Simpson found
the man lading at the rear of a house a
block away and quickly had him by the
throat. On his persou was found a com
plete set of bureiar j' tools, as well as a lot
of valuable jewelry taken from the Corn
wall place. To the police ha gave the
name of Samuel Slmssler. Later it was
found that he arrived in Stockton yester
day morning, registering at the Sherman
Huu c, where he gave ihe name of L. Bar
rett. In his room were founa a pair of
rubber-soled shoes, a revolver and more
burglars' tools.
But for the chaso Mrs. Cornwall gave
the burglar he would probably have
eluded capture.
ANOTHER WHARF
FOR SAN PEDRO
Huntington Will Build in
the Deep -Water
Harbor.
Prospective Fight Against the
Government Wharf and
Breakwater.
Coal-Bunkers, Warehous s ani a Grid
iron of Railroads on th?
New Pier.
LOS ANGELES, Cat,., March 10.âIm
mediately after San Pedro had been
selected as the site for the deep-sea har
bor the southern coast of California all
manner of speculation was indulged in as
to how Huntington would square accounts
with the people of this city for opposing
his harbor scheme at Santa Monica, where
the Southern Pacific has its long wharf.
San Diego people affected to believe that
Huntington'a plan would be to construct
an adequate wbarf in the harbor there,
build the Yuraa branch road and side
track Los Angeles.
It seems now, however, that Hunting
ton has an entirely different scheme In
view. He proposes to make a virtue of
necessity, and instead of permitting his
rivals to get the better of him through the
use of a public wharf and breakwater at
San Pedro he means to outwharf the Gov
ernment itself in the construction of a
new wharf for the business of the South
ern Pacific tnat shall be larger by far and
every way superior to the long wharf at
Santa Monica.
The new wharf will extend along the
water front for a great distance, and (ben
spread out into several piers, something
after the fashion of slips, and, with the
breakwater, will afford the finest oppor
tunity for the loading and unloading of
deep-water vessels in the world.
One of the features of the new wharf
will be a special landing for coast steam
ers, so that passengers and their effects
can be landed and placed on trains for
Los Angeles with a great saving of time
and expense, This undertaking was de
cided upon immediately after the harbor
decision, and will be the biggest thing of
its kind on the coast.
The officers of the company smile when
the matter is broached to them, and say
that the Southern Pacific is at San Pedro
to do business, and now that the harbor
is located therj they will have the most
complete and extensive facilities for
handling tnis business.
According to the plans vessels of all
draughts win be able to tie ap to this
wharf and pier and unload without the
slightest friction or damage. The wharf
and pier will be a regular gridiron of rail
roads, and there will be bunkers for coal,
warehouses for merchandise and depots
in abundance.
FOUNDER'S DAY AT PALO ALTO.
Faculty and Students Honor the Memory
of the Late Senator Stan
ford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 10. â Yesterday was a holiday for
the university students, and the birthday
of the late Senator Leland Stanford was
appropriately observed with exercises in
the chapel in the evening. The chapel
was well filled with students, faculty
members and visitors before the com
ment of the exercises. The pulpit from
which the speakers addressed the audience
was tastefully decorated with evergreens
and choice flowers and potted plants.
Dr. Stillman. acting president of the
university during Dr. Jordan's absence,
presided. Miss Edith V- Jaggers ren
dered "Sing^ O Heart," with great expres
sion. She was accompanied by Dully '97.
Dr. Stilltnan then traced briefly the his
tory of the university. Said he:
We observe this day in memory of the Illus
trious founder. Twelve years ago the endow
ment act was signed. This put the bequests to
the university under the protection of the
State. Palo Alto, a place now dear to us all,
was chosen as the spot for the location of
Stanford University. In 1891 the univornlty
opened with thirty instructors and the sur
pnsiug number of 400 students. Then came
days of trouble. Mrs. Stanford, with lndomi
tabie courase, met them all unflinchingly.
Great praise ia also due to Dr. Jordan. With
out the help of Dr. Jordan the faculty and the
university itself could not be held together.
Laws have been passed by the State of Cali
fornia to aid Mrs. Stanford in her work. The
lawmakers have refused, however, to relieve
the university from taxation. Mr. Timothy
Hopkins has also been of great assistance to
the university. The seaside laboratory and
the railrond library are due to his free-handed
generosity.
Rev. Mr. Briges was then introduced as
the speaker of the evening. He said, in
part:
We are not here to strew flowers on the
graves of the dead. We are here to garland

TO SUPPRESS SCALPERS
Fine and Imprisonment Pro
vided as Alternative
Penalties.
Action of the License Committee.
Ottinger Says Scalpers May
Feht.
The License Committee of the Board of
Supervisors will report to the board an
ordinance to repeal the ordinance licens
ing ticket-scalpers and providing a penalty
for selling railroad or steamship tickets In
this City and County outside of a railroad
or steamship ticket office. The text of
the proposed order is as follows:
Section 1. It shall be unlawful for any per
son to sell in the City and County of Sun Fran
cisco any railroad ticket at any place other
than at the office of a railroad company, or to
sell any steamship ticket at any place except
in the office of a steamship company.
Sec. 2. Any person violating any of tho pro
visions of this order shall be deemed guilty of
a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof,
be punished by a fine of not more than $100,
or by imprisonment not more than 103 days,
or by both such nne and imprisonment.
Sec. 3. This order shall not be construed to
apply to the tickets of street railroads operated
in this City and County.
Sec. 4. Order 1904 and hII orders or parts of
orders conflicting with the provisions of this
order are hereby repealed.
Sec. 5. This order shall take effect and be in
force from and after its passage.
In addition to the proposed order tne
committee will submit a report setting
forth, as the reasons for such action, sub
stantially the following:
The committee of the Carnival of the Golden
Gate, in consideration of the railroad, steam
ship and other transportation companies hav
ing agreed to materially reduce fares to and
from this City and County, and to carry
and transport exhibits free of cost or
charÃe, desires to be protected from ticket
peddlers, who will and can take advantage of
such coupons by purchasing tickets so sold at
reduced rates, with siop-over privileges, for
persons who under lalse pretenses obtain sucli
tickets at reduced rates. As represented, the
companies agree to subscribe liberally to the
fund as well as to make sucti reductions nnd
ex. end nil privileges desired if this board will
prohibit the sale of railroad or steamship
tickets at any place except the regular oftleea
of the railroad or steamship companies.
As it is important that every aid should be
extended to foster anl encourage the efforts
ot tho general committee la inducing a large
influx <ji visitors to this City and County and
the State it can only be done by lessening the
expenses of transportation to and from the
City and County, atid if that is done it is ex
pected by the general committee that about
50,000 strangers will visit this City. Tour
committee therefore reports in favor of repeal
ing order 1904 and of requiring all railroad or
steamship tickets to be sold at the respective
offices of the railroad and steamship com
panies.
General Warfield, 8. M. Backus, Henry
Martin and S. H. Friedlander of the car
nival committee appeared before the
License Committee yesterday morning
and urged the adoption of an order.
The License Committee denied the ceti
tion of the Madrid Mutual Benevolent
Society to change the date for holding its
masquerade ball from April 24 to May 1.
The carnival committee objected to the
change of date because that would bring
the Madrid Society into competition with
the carnival.
Adolph Ottinger, the ticket-broker, of
618 Market street, when asked whether
the local scalpers proposed to take any
definite action in opposition to the pro
posed order of the Supervisors, said that
they would undoubtedly raise. a protest.
"General Warfield's argument," continued
he, "to the effect that we are likely to do
a thriving business during the carnival
at the expense of the transportation com
panies, hasn't great weight in this case,
because most of the tickets we sell are
transcontinental. The railway companies
are taking advantage of the carnival pre
text to create a monopoly and enable them
to charge high ratei. If the ordinance
passes the public will never obtain any
reduction."MAY HIT

Referee Siler Announces
the Rules to Govern
the Fight.
IDLE RUMORS HASTEN
HIS ACTION.
Reports That He Would Favor
Fitzsimmons Had Been
Circulated.
THE AUBURN'HAIRED FIGHTER
NOT PLEASED.
Wanted the Announcement Delayed
Until the Men Entered the
Ring.
CARSON, Nev., March 10.â The most
delicate subject in connection with the big
light was broached to-day, when Referee
George Siler submitted to Corbett and
Fitziimmons his interpretation of the
Queensberry rules. Siler's communica
tion, which Is in the nature of a formal
letter, was not received with manifesta
tions of joy at either camp. The big fel
lows read their letters thoughtfully, and
reserved judgment. If Biler had any
doubts as to the propriety of his action in
outlining his views at this time, they
must be dissipated now. The fighters
could never have agreed upon the rules
after entering the rinc. Each man ap
pears to be playing possum and waiting
for the other to commit himself. It is not
unwise, however, to predict that a con
ference between Slier, Stuart and the
representatives of the principals will be
necessary before the matter of rules is
finally settled.
Mr. Siler's letter, which was handed to
the public shortly after noon, was as fol
lows:
Caksox, Xev., March 10, 1897.
To James J. Cotbett Esq. and Jiobert Fitzsim
â¢ . - Esq., Carson Cityâ uenti.emk.v: Herewith
I hand you each ihe rules of the Marquis of
Qneensberry, under the provisions of whish
you are to contest for the heavy-weight cham
pionship of the world in this city on March
17, 1897. Accompanying the rules 1 hand
you some suggestions and instructions. These
are based upon careful study, research, equiiy
ana fairness. You are principals to what will
be the greatest contest of modern times. You
have both trained carelully and assiduously.
The principals and public are alike engrossed
iO an extent never belore made manifest In a
]!ke encounter.. While it Is a departure to
jTi.-Kruet.ons to the combatants in a
batiie like this a week in advance of the
meeting, I think that the importance oÂ£ the
affair fully warrants this move. lam conn
dent that yon both -want to win solely and
wholly on your meritÃ. Neither of you can
nfford to have the slightest suspicion of doubt
cloud the title which will belong to the victor.
To that end I herewith hand you the rules
anil certain interpretations under which you
are to battle:
Rule Iâ To be a fair, stand-up boxing match
in a twenty-iour-foot ring, or as near that size
as practicable.
Rule 2 â No wrestling or hugging allowed.
Rule 3â The rounds to be of three minutes'
duration and one minute time between
rounds.
Eule 4â lf either man fall, through weakness
or otherwise,- he must get up unassisted, ten
seconds to be allowed him to do so, the other
man meanwhile to return to his corner, and
when the fallen man is on his leps the round
is to be resumed and continued until the three
minutes have expired. If one man fails to
come to the scratcn in the ten seoonds allowed
it shall be in the power of the referee to give
h!s award in favor of the other man.
Rule 5â A man hanging on the ropes in a
helpless state with his toes oft the ground
Bhall be oonsidered down.
Rule 6â No seconds or my other person to
be allowed in the ring during the rouuds.
Rule 7â Should tne contest be stopped by
any unavoidable interference the referee to
name time and place as soon as possible for
fiaiihing the contest, so that the match must
be won and lost, unless me backers of both
men agree to draw the stakes.
Rule Bâ The gloves to be fair-sized boxing
gloves of tne best quality.
Rule 9â Should a glove burst or come off it
must be leplaced to the referee's satisfaction.
Rule 10â A "man on one Knee is considered
down, and if struck is entitled to the slakes.
Rule 11â No shoes or boots with springs al
low cd.
Rule 12â The contest in all other respects to
be governed by tha revised rules of tne Lon
don prize ring.
The first Uiree rules need no comment, as
they are plain, simple and understood by al
liaost everybody. Rule four, however, re-
Vulres some analysis, as some of the points are
â  :ten misconstrued. The rule says: "Ifeiiher
fall through weakness or otherwise, he
must get ud unassisted, ten seconds to bo al
lowed him to do so, the otherman, meanwhile,
to rettirn to hig corner."
This, of course, was Intended to prevent a
man from standing over his fallen opponent.
It probably never appeared to the framer of
the rules that at times a man neither falls or
Is knocked down in his opponent's corner. If,
then, the man on his feet retires to his corner,
as the rules direct, he will be standing over
his fallen opponent, and doing just what the
rules mean he shall not do.
To avoid- all disputes on this score I will
simply instruci you in ca<e of a knockdown to
retire at least ten feet from your fallen oppo
nent, lo give him an opportunity to rise.
Rule 12. which says "The contest in all
other respects to tie governed by the revised
rules of the London prize ring," is, I consider,
one of the most important of the twelve rules,
and appears to be the bone of contention in
almost ever/ contest. It has been the custom
of re :erees, myself among them, to inquire of
the principals whether they chose to hit in
clinches with one arm free, and also in break
aways. Invariably the principals agree not
to hit in clinches or in breakaways, but they
generally forget all about thuir agreement
and frequently violate it. This causes not
only the seconds but the spectators to cry
â¢â¢foul!" every time a blow is delivered in a
clinch or on a breakaway, and causes much
trouble and argument. It also makes the du
ties of a referee arduous and disagreeable and
keeps him continually in hot water. Further
j more it gives the referee an opportunity to de
â¢â (ide a contest on a technical foul, which is
generally unsatisfactory to everybody con
cerned.
Neither of you, I am sure, desires to win the
coming contest on a technical foul, and to
Bvoid any such contingency tiirough hitting
in clinches with a lree arm and in breakaways
1 will rule:
That you be' permitted to nil in clinches
with one arm free, and also on breakaways.
With this interpretation of this rule an
nounced a week before the contest, you will
both have Hmple time to practice these im
portant points, and will have no cause for
complaint shouid either of you be caught off
his guard.
Pivot blows, missing with cither hand and
whipping back with the elbow, mretine an
opponent with or deliberately striking him
with the elbow or knees are barred and will be
considered foul. Should any of the above
blows have any material effect ou the result of
the contest I shall use my judgment accord
ingly. Should any ot the- seconds of either
principal enter the ring during a round to ren
der any assistance to the fighters or prevent
them from committing n frul or to throw
water on them it shall be deemed a foul.
Coaching by seconds during the rounds is
objectionable to everybody, and is apt to cre
ate ditcord and argument- Both oi you have
undoubtedly mapped out youi plans of attack
and defense and need no advice from your re
spective seconds. The latter will, therefore,
refrain from making any comment dur.ng the
contest.
Trivial fouls may be unintentionally com
mitted by either of you, which, unless they
have a direct bearing on the result, will be
overlooked by me at my discretion.
This, I believe, covers all the Important
points. Both of you are thoroughly ac
quainted with the Marquis of Queensberry
rules not touched upon by me, and I hope to
see you both live strictly up to them.
With a fair field, no favor, no prejudices, I
remain very truly yours,
George Siler, Referee.
At the suggestion of George Siler, Dan
Stuart to-day f elected Alalachy Hogan of
Chicago to referee the Smith-Green and
Hawkins-Flaherty contests on March 16;
Corbett's father will come up from San
Francisco to-morrow in company with Al
Smith of New York.
WILL NOT COMPLAIN.
Corbett and Fi.zslmmons Likely to
Accept Referee Siler's
Rules.
CARSON, Nkv., March 10.â Bob Fitz
simmons came into town to-day madder
than the proverbial wet lien. He had
heard of Referee George Siler a announce
ment, as appeared in Tht Call pesterday,
to the effect that the famous Chicagoau
who >s to decide the creat contest would
to-day formulate and give the rules which
are to govern the battle, and he claimed
that if Siler did this it would be treaiins:
him unfairly. Fitzsiromons has declared
all along that the referee had no right to
say what special rules should govern the
contest until the very day of the battle
itself. The particular clause which per
mits hitting in the clinches and break
aways is what has bothered the Cornish
man. While he could never be made to
admit that he had any fear of meeting
Corbett at this> game, still he advanced
the argument that it was unfair to have
the rules known in advance so that Cor
bett could perfect himself in the particu
lar style of fighting laid down by those
rules. At one time he declared he would
not right if Siler made his announcement
in advance.
Corbett, however, has said all along that
he did not care what rules were to govern
the contest, but he preferred that they be
known early, so thai the public as well
as the fighters would have a chancs to get
familiar with the rules. Jim argued that
when the spectators were ignorant of the
regulations governing a contest they were
apt to hiss and cry "foul," when in re
ality no violation had been committed,
and consequently the referee and the
boxers were made to feel uncomfortable.
With Fitzsimmons clamoring for one
thing and Corbett's n.ind set on another
it would naturally be supposed that all
Referee Siler's troubles were not to be con
fined to the ring proper. This might be
true enough in a measure, but not to the
extent of adding any gray hairs to the
head of this greatest of all ring judges.
Siler is too old a bird to be rattled by dis
putes of this sort â he has been too long a
wise sportsman. As soon as it became
manifest that a wrangle over the rules was
In sight â and it was nearly two weeks
ago â Siler decided to turn a deaf ear to
both pugilists and pursue the even tenor
of his way.
"If Coroett and Fitzsimmons can agree
between them upon any particular set of
rules, why, I am ready and willing to
abide by them and see that the terms of
the agreement are carried out," said Siler
at the time, "but if they don't agree
within a reasonable time I will announce
the rules myself, and announce them
when I get ready."
Argument on this tioint was dropped
after this, and for a fortnight nothing
more about rules was heard. Siler evi
dently came to the conclusion that the
reasonable time he had allowed to the big
fellows to reach an agreement had about
expired yesterday, and that is why he
announced that be was about to make
public the rules that would govern the
mill.
Fitzsimmons' contract to be exclusive
did not prevent him from declaring on
the street this morning that he believed
Siler was giving him the worst end of the
deal.
"All I have asked for in this case was
justice," he otclared to a number of
acquaintances. "I told Siler and every
body else who spoke to me in reference to
the matter that the easiest way to be fair
to both Corbett and myself would be to
announce the rules at tne ringside. That
would compel both of us to practice all
styles â hitting in clinches and square
breakawaysâ and would be as fair to one
as to the other. lam asking for no ad
vantage; I want none. When Siler held
off I was led to believe that lie va* going
to follow up my suggestion, but I see now
that hd is not. But, then, 1 don't sup
pose there is much use of kicking about it
now. I will take matters as they come,
and will lick that fellow just the same."
The fight is just a week off yet, and it
may have been Siler's intention not to an
nounce the rules until Saturday or Sun
day. In fact I have reason to believe that
such was really his programme. But I
also have authority for saying that George
had particular reasons â the result of quite
recent occurrencesâ that actuated him in
making his announcement earlier than
he had intended. A day or two ago word
reached Carson to the effect that a tele
gram was sent to Chicago from here by a
close friend of Siler, advising speculation
on Fitzsimmons 1 chance*. The recipients
of the telegram must have reached the
immediate conclusion that Siler was go
ing to formulate rules that would suit tne
Cornishman and put Corbett at sea, for
they began to bet on Bob and to distribute
their information amone their friends.
This news reached both Siler and Cor
bett. The latter said he thought he was
entitled to some sort of an explanation,
and he received it promptly from the ref
eree in the shape of a declaration that be
was in no way responsible for the news
conveyed in that telegram. It was then
that Corbelt suggested that the best way
to prevent any surprises at the ringside
was to announce cbe rules as soon as pos
sible. Siler, after a moment's reflection,
agreed tbat the Californian was right.
Siler's honesty baa never been ques
tioned throughout his career in the sport
ing v.orld, and this was not the time, he
concluded, to permit of even the slightest
shadow to bi cast in h:s direction. This
is really what hurried him into declaring
last night tbat he would give the rules to
the world to-day. He sat up all night in
order to Keep his word. In reality only
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 11, 1897.
two of the clauses in the rules bothered
him. The fir-t of these was the one
which treated of tbe mooted privilege of
hitting with a free arm in the clinches,
and hitting In the breakaways. Custom
has practically made it a rule in modern
glove contests for the referee to separate
the comb itants the moment they clincn,
and permit no hitting until they are well
apart. But this is in reality a violation of
the Marquis of Queensberry rules. Eiler,
after several hours' cud cling of his brain,
decided to adhere to the original rules.
The otbar provision that bothered him
was the one which decrees that when one
contestant knock? the other down he must
immediately retire to his corner and wait
uniil his foe has arisen before resuming
the attack. Now Siler, during his expe
rience as a referee, has often had occasion
to note the impracticability of this rule
under certain conditions. Suppose, for
instance, Fitzsimmons would be knocked
down in Corbett's corner. The Califor
ni:iii, under the rules, would have the
right to deliberately stand over him and
strike tLie moment he reached his feet,
which, of course, is something that never
occurred to the originators of the Marquis
of Queensberry regulations. In this parti
cular case Siler decided to depart from the
original rules and enact in its stead some
thing smacking of justice. He will re
quire that when one man is down the
other must step uway at least ten feet,
there to remain until the fallen one has
regained his feet.
Corbett said, after glancing over the
rules, that they suited him in every par
ticular, lie said be never had entertained
any doubt as to Siler's fairness, and the
rules as interpreted by that gentleman
proved conclusively that he deserved his
good name.
Fitzsitnmons, whi'e still a little huffy
over what lie considered the premature
issuance of the rules, declared that there
was nothing in them that he could object
to, and he guessed they would prove to be
&s fair to one as to the other. Now that
ihey were out he had no further com
plaints to make.
Everybody has been enjoying a laugh
tv-day at the expense of the prophet of
tbe locul weather bureau. This seer
gravely announced yesterday that to-day
would bring forth another snowstorm,
and the light promoters and their well
wishers were in consequence much de
pressed. What added strength to the
weather clerk's prophecy was the fact
that a violent wind blew up last nigut and
howled and moaned until the cocks boy an
to crow. Everybody expected to woke up
and find Carson once more attired in h
garb of white, but it was an agreeable sur
prise to note that not a fluke had fallen
and in place ol the storm the sun shone
its brightest. And in defiance of the
Signal Service a veritable summer's day
followed and everybody went out for a
sunning.
In consequence of this propitious
weather unusually large crowds journeyed
out to the training quarters <;f both of the
heavy-weiehts. True, there was not a great
deal to see, in view ol the fact that both
Corbett and Fitzsimmons are not doing
the hard work thut characterized their
training during the past three weeks, but
a glimpse at the big fellows themselves
auits tbe average visitor, so there was no
grumbling.
The greater part of Fitzsimmons' work
consisted of walking and running on the
roads surrounding Cook's Ranch, and in
cluding his usual trip to tbe penitentiary
for a bmh and a run into town. By coinci
dent Corbett, who was out for a tramp
during the forenoon, also v.'sited the prison.
Had he arrived there live minutes sooner
he would have met the man he is to face
in the ring next Wednesday. Coibett hates
the Cornishman and the latter despises the
Californian. While no one supposes that
the big fellows would have bÂ±en silly
enough to clinch the moment tbey espied
each other, still it is conceded on all sides
that it was better that they missed meet
ing, for there would have at least been an
exchange of compliments that would only
have tended to embitter them the more
toward each other.
The afternoon work of the eladiators
consisted of the i^sual routine of bag
punching, handball - playing and light
boxing.
The Central Pacific Railroad Company
sent one of its heaviest locomotives from
Reno to Carson thia morning lor the pur
pose ot testing the strength of the Virginia
und Truckee Company's roadbed. There
has been some doubt regarding the letter's
ability to hold the mammoth Pullmans
and engines that it is desired to send to
Carson during the two days preceding the
fight and after it, but to-day's test dis
pelled all such fears. The only difficulty
encountered was at the tunnel near Lake
view. Th's was found a trifle low, but a
force of workmen is now lowering the
track so as to obviate this little fault.
Nearly everybody in Carson is rejoicing
over the happy adjustment of the diffi
culty between the fi.-.ht management and
United Siates Attorney Charley Jones,
which for a fewj hours seriously threat
ened Dan Stuart's big project. It is ad
mitted that Jones was correct in demand
ing his lights, and the generosity of the
promoters also comes in for much com
mentation.
T. R. Hofer, a prominent man of Car
son, to-day received deeds for land and
securities, valued in all at $8000, from a
friend in Arizona, to be wagered on the
big contest. The Arizona man leaves the
little matter of picking the winner to Mr.
Hofer, and the latter gentleman promptly
announces that the securities would be
placed on Corbet t. J. G. MANSFiKr.D.
CORBETT'S FIRST FIGHT.
Battled With Choynski In a Barn
Until Mann's Sheriff In
terfered,
Jim Corbett's first professional fight of
note was in May, 1889, against Joe
Choynski. The men were mntcned to do
battle to a finish, Â»nd the site was a de
serted milk ranch three milea back in the
hills from San Anselmo, Marin County.
Sheriff Healey of Marin County vras on
the lookout for fistic disturbances, but
through some mistake he pot on the
wroni; track and did not arrive at the bat
tle-ground until the principals had
warmed up to their work. In fact the con
test could have been decided long before
the Sheriff arrived if the principals had
I not delayed so long in getting ready for
business.
A tins was pitchra in the barn and tne
"invited guests" who had cards of admis
sion to the old loft gathered around the
ropeu, but not before they were searched
I and all weapons taken from them. Some
! cad razors, some pistols and others bowie
knives. A few pairs of scissors were
; lounti among the tailors of sporting pro
clivities. Such a collection of frontier
i armaments cutild not have been found
â¢anywhere at the time outside of Buffalo
i Bill's Wild West show.
Two lookouts were posted at the win
| dow*, with instructions to keep an eye
open for the Sheriff's posses, and the mas
ter of ceremonies instructed the gang not
to scatter it the officers appeared. A pair
: of iiillows was provided to take the place
! of the small gloves mentioned in the arti
cles of agreement if the Sheriff inter
fered.
At 10:27 on the mornine of May 30 Jim
Corbelt dung his bit; overcoat lo one eide,
when the query, "Are you leady, Doys? 1 '
was given, and he stepped lightly between
me ropes into the ring. His opponent,
Choynski, did not keep Corbett lone in
suspense, for he, too, stepped quickly be
tween the ropes=, and the fighters "sizsd
each other up" as they stood in their re
spective corners ready for action.
Instead of the regulation wooden buckets
the seconds of the men carried old oil
cans filled with water, and their bottles
were those which had been emptied of
liquor on the road from Sausalito to the
battle-ground. Corbett was attired in
pink-colored knee-tishts and low gym
nasium-shoe?, while Clioynski wore black
knee-tights, stockings of the same color
and high laced fighting-shoes. The gloves
were of the finest kid and weighed two
ounces. Corbett's weight is said to have
bpen 182 pounds and Choynski was credited
with Iti3 pounds. Corbett as usual ap
peared pale and excited and looked any
thing biit a man tit to enter into a fistic
engagement. Choynski bore a confident
louk and his condition was admired by all.
While shaking hands Corbeit offered to
wager Choynski that be would win, but
the offer was made in such an unassum
ing and good-natured way that the crowd
applauded it heartily. Choynski an
swered that he had no money to bet, and
Corbett did not press him.
Upon the call of time the men toed the
scratch and sparred cautiously, but Cor
bett soon took the defens.ve and Choyn
ski backed into a corner. Joe led for Jim's
stomach and then fell short, then he
swung his right for Jim's head and
mised. Corbett fiddled conn lerably, as
if to draw his opponent along, anci finally
seeing an opening he sent out his left
straight from the shoulder and the blow
landed lightly on Joe's jaw as time was
called.
In the second round Corbett went at
Choynski sharply and sent in lefts and
rights, some of which were neatly stoppad.
Choyiuki got in a hard glancing shot on
Corbett's nose, which peeled some of
the bark from that orean; then there
was a mix-up, both men landing on body
and face. As Choynski ducked lroin a
right hook he was cau^hi with a left
uppercut which staegered him lor an in
stant. . Corbett rushed his game, but
Choynski by clinching and hugging
avoided further punishment. Corbett was
now full of light, and in trying to release
himself from a clinch he flung Choynski
on the floor, Joe landing on his back.
When Choynski regained his feet he
dashed at Corbett and some hot fighting
resulted. Aaain the men clinched, aim
while they wer- locked Corbett was indus
triously stnashine Joe with his right fist
in the kidneys. A loud cry of "Foul" was
raised, and as the fignters finally broke
away Corbett landed heavily on Joe's face
and one of his backers cried, "Bo careful,
Jim!" A short rally ended the round,
after both men had exchanged lefts on
facf and body.
When the next round was called both
men were puffing, and whatever blows
were delivered were of the long-range
order. Corbeit certainly had the best of
the mill up to this point, and he was cut
ting out a pretty fast dash near the finish
of the round, when one of the watchmen
shouted:
"Boys, let go I Sheriff Healey is coming
on horseback!"
The fighters walked to their corners,
the small gloves were quickly removed
and the pillows substituted.
ThÂ« Sheriff dismounted and was soon
standing at the ringside. Some one intro
dnred him to Corbeit, who said:
"I'm glad to meet you, Sheriff, but I
would have been a heap gladder if you
had landed here about ten minutes later."
The Sheriff smiled and said that time
was up for the breakaway. The hint was
taken, and after the ring-stakes were
pulled up the crowd dispersed in the same
manner as it hÂ«d ccnr\
Sinldtin Heath at Modesto.
MODESTO. Cal., March 10. â Peter
Lesber, a pioneer and one of the best
known business men in this valley, died
suddenly of heart disease this morning.
Commodore Lesher came to Modesto in
1883, and has been in the liquor business
| here ever since He was a member of the
j linn of Lestier <fc Vogelman, which form-

SUICIDE OR MURDER
William Hennessy Daad and
Several Suspects Ar
resied
It Was at First Thought He Killed
Himself, but Another Theory
Is Grcwio*.
William Hennessy, abont 30 year 9of
age, was thought to have committed
suicide by shooting himself through the
head in a small room in the St. David
House, 715 Howard street, at an early
hour yesterday morning.
Hennessy, accompanied by George
Riley, Thomas Shannon, Mary McCann
and Kate Frank, entered the St. David
House about 2 o'clock in the morning.
Several drinks were purchased by Shan
non and Rellly and Hennessy finally
ordered refreshments, lieiore they wero
served, however, he left the party and
went into a rear room.
A few moments later a shot was heard,
and on investigation Hennessy was found
lying in a pool of blood, dead.
Tup body was removed to the Morgue,
and when searched it was found that tho
deceased was penniless.
This fnct Jed the Coroner's deputies to
believe that after having ordered the
drink?, t lie suicide was ashamed to let his
friends know that he was without money,
and killed himself.
Sergeant Donovan of the Southern sta
tion was instructed to investigate the
case.
He did so and last evening, concluding
that the case was worthy of further inves
tigation, arrested those who were with
Hennessy at the time of his death.
They were George Riley. Thomas Shan
non, Mary McCann and Kate Fiank.
Riley says that the two women, Shan
non himself ami Hennessy were all drink
ing i:i the St. D iviii House.
Hennessy wanted one of the women to
go with him; she refused, and then he
got up and wont into another room nnd
they heard a shot. That was all.

FELL OVER A
DOG AND LOST
Many a Sensation at the
San Jose Bicycle
Meet.
McFarland Thrown, Ziegler Woo,
but Refused to Take the
Money.
The Amateur One-Tbird Mile Fina'
One of the Closest Races
en the Track.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 10.â The meet
given here to-day under the auspices of
the Garden City Cyciers was largely
attended and productive of many a sensa
tion.
Th" Ziegler-McFarland match was the
great event, but after each had won a
heat and two-thirds of the final had been
ridden, a dog interfered, with the result
that McFarland and the pacemakers,
Terriil and Davis, were thrown, while
Zi-gler strung to the outside and passed
by iv safety. Ziegler won the first heat In
2:01 and McFarland the second in 2:00 2-5.
Kefeiee Col awarded the race to Ziegler,
who finished the third heat in 2:08. The
little fellow refused to take the money,
and desired to race the final over at
some future date. It was decided to
bring it off at the indoor tournament to
be held in San Francisco commencing
March 20.
The mil*) open professional was won by
C. S. Wells in a surprising manner, with
Jones a ciosa second. The favorite,
Loughead, failed to qualify, much to the
disappointment of many a fair one in the
big crowd. Wing won the third of a mile
scratch amateur from Percy Mott, while
the latter got even by defeating him in
the two-thirds of a mile handicap.
The Ziegler-McFarland race was divided
into three heats, Ziegler securing the pole
in the first. The start was a rolling one,
the men being scarcely in motion as they
crossed the tape. Clarence Davis and Bob
Terrill did the pacing on a tandem, and
right well did they perform their work.
Ziegler was forced from his position be
hind the pacemakers on the backstretch,
Mcl-'arinii'i winning the first blood amid
great enthusiasm. On the last Jap the
tandem dropped out and McFarland led off
in ihe sprint. Zegler passed him in the
homestretch and, won out by a length.
In the second heat McFarland again got
the tandem and held the lead this time
clear to the tape, Ziegler having his sprint
taken out of him by the furious clip at
which the mile had been ridden. As al
rendy told, the third heat was spoiled by
McFarland fulling. Tne pace up to the
time of the fail had been faster than in the
ottier, and McFarland looked every inch a
winner.
Tne mile open professional was divided
into three preliminary heata and a final.
Those qualifying for Hie latter were
Becker, Wellj, Jones, Ha ry Terrill, Stev
ens, Bovee ana Downing. Longhead did
the pacing, Downing getting the position
after a struggle of nearly a Jap. Oil the
last lap Wells went up from rear position
and won out in a driving tini.-h with
Jones. Becker was a dose third and Ter
rill fourtu. Stevens was fifth, Bovee sixth
and Downing last. Time, 2:14 2-5.
The amateur races were somewhat
dimmed by the brilliancy of the profes
sional event, but in their own way pro
vided excellent sport. In the first heat
of the one-third mile race Mott and Wing
came together, Mott winning in rather
ordinary time. The second heat went to
(Jooch after a hard tigiit with Bacon of the
Olympic Cyclers who rode in excellent
form. The time, 45 seconds, was excel
lent.
The final was one of the closest races
ever seen on the San Jose track, six men
finishing with wheels overlapping. At
the start Bacon led off, with Mott in close
attendance. At half the distance Gooch
assumed the lead and started the slash for
the tape. Moti went out on the last Dank
and looked all over a winner, but as the
field straightened out for home he went
back to his men, and as they neared the
tape all came up together with a rush.
The placing of the men was a difficult
task, the judges finally deciding the order
of the lirst three to bÂ« Wing, Mott and
Bacon.
In the two-thirds of a mile handicap,
amateur, tho men on the limit mark did
not try to get away, the consequence be
ing t at the lifid bunched at once and
made it a scratch race. Hardenbrook
sliowed lirst in the sprint, followed by
Mott. In the last hundred yards Goocii
made a determined effort and secured the
lead from Mott, who seemel to let up in
his exertion*. Gooch won, with Mott
second end Wing third.

THEIR SHOW WAS
QUITE A SUCCESS
The Unemployed Cleared
Nearly Two Hundred
Dollars.
Old Clothing and Old Shoes
Badly Needed at Head
quarters.
Railroad to Be Asked for Low Rates
for Unemployed Leaving for
Country Jobs
The unemployed were busy yesterday
to the extent of gathering in unsold tick
ets and determining just how much they
made from the show in the Auditorium
on the night before. At latest accounts
they had cleared about $190, or over $40
in excess of the original estimate.
This cash is sadly needed at the head
quarters, where applications for relief
come in daily from women and little
children in dre distress and threatened
with ejectment from their miserable liv
ing places. What is most needed, and
what should be more easy to obtain, is old
clothes for the destitute and needy among
the unemployed aud those depending
upon them.
The relief committee wishes to make a
special request to benevolently inclined
individuals ior old clothing of any kind,
and especially for shoes, for men, women
and children. If the address be sent to
the relief committee at the headquarters
for the unemployed at t>l4 Howard street
some one will'be detailed and properly au
thorized to collect the contribution at the
home of the donor.
Yesterday a bundle of old clothes was
Fentin by "Miss Fanny Muraskey ot 1014
Harrison street. L. A." Bryan of 300 Mar
ket street gave eight pairs of new shoes,
and other kindly disposed persons sent
old clothes and some nity loaves of bread.
The relief committee assisted eleven
familes yesterday and relieved forty-four
of the unemployed with allotments of old
clothes from the small supply on hand.
A communicaiion was received from
Mrs. Emily E. Lassague of 311 Van Ness
avenue offering shelter for three or four
persons.
The chairman of the relief committee
a-serts in explanation of his request for
certain accommodations for unemployed
cases at the City and County Hospital
and at the County Almstiouse that some
provision is necessary lor dangerously ill
persons such as have been reported to the
committee and for aged persons who are
beyond the working age.
They are cases for public care and can
not be providea for by the unemployed,
but if life is worth saving the City and ;
County should upon application offer some !
shelter to those very urgent cases. He ;
a^ked for three cots in the Almshouse and )
for three cots in the City and County Hos
piial that the little funds of the army of
unemployed might not be heavily taxed
by having to be used in paying for care at
private nospitals, where humanity de
mands that attention be given particular
cases of dangerous illness.
Last night several hundred of the un
employed, apprised at a late hour of the

"THE SOCIALISM OF OERIST."
Rev. Dr. Moreland Lectures at the
Turk-Street iemple.
A largo audience was present at the
Turk-street Temple last evening to hear
Rev. Dr. W. H. Moreland, rector ol Bt.
Luke's, lecture on tlje "Socialism of
Christ." The interest manifested through
out was intense, and the speaker was fre
quently interrupted by applause. J. Lar
sen acted as chairman.
"I am present," said the speaker, "as 8
disciple of Christ and a priest of the
church to remove any wrong Impression
with regard to the attitude of the church
toward socialism. The kingdom of ChriÂ«t
is the kingdom of humanity and social
equality and justice.
"When you are trying to spread the
reign of justice and equality on earth you
are disseminating the doctrine of Jesus
Christ."
Competition Dr. Moreland regarded as
the cause of poverty, and thought mer
chants on that account were unable to
mate a living by observing the golden
rule. Neither did he believe that an act
of Congress or any legislative enactment
could change human character.
Rev. J. E. Scott, P. Ross Saartin, Leo
Gffsger, Theodore Lynch, William Edlin,
Henry Warnecke, Dr. j. D. Brock and
George Barnaby followed in short, rive
minute speeches. In general their senti
ments were in agreement with that of the
lecturer, except Barnaby, who believed
the little book entitled "Merry England"
contained more socialism in ten pages
than the whole of the Bible. Brock's
views coincided in the main, bnt he did
not believe that Christianity could work
any decided change.
lecture on "The Maid of Orleans."
Professor Alhin Putzker of the University of
California will lecture this evening on
"Woman's Patriotism Idealized in Schiller's
Maid of Orleans." This is the fifth lecture in

fessor Putzker at the German Y. M. C. A. Hall,

in these literary evenings has increased from

FARES BY THE RIVER.
One of Two lival steam* hip I.inpi
Slakes a Complalnt-25-Cent Fare
From San Kafael.
Before the meeting of the State Rail
way Commissioners yesterday a letter
was read from James GiUis, president of
the Union Transportation Company,
charging the Valley Railroad with dis
criminating against his company and in
favor of the California Navigation Com
pany. Both Mr. Gillis' company and the
latter run steamers between San Fran
cisco and Stockton. They are rivals of
each other.
Mr. Gillis thought that the managers of
the new railroad had reduced passenger
and freight rates to the California Nuvi
gation Company, and, as he said, entered
into a conspiracy with it. His own com
pany could not get such rates, nor could
the public. It wai decided that the matter
should be heard in detail on the 24th
inst., when officers of the Valley road will
be present.
Girvin and Eyre have been making this
fight for some timÂ», and Gillis, who is also
interested in warehousing in Stockton, in
tends to press the matter. Both the
Valley road officials and the managers of
the California Navigation and Improve
ment Company, who handle the Valley
road freight going by water, have claimed
all along that it ha-* been far from their
intention to do anything to injure
Stockton.
A petition was received from Marin
County asking for lower rates of fare be
tween San Francisco and San Rafael. J. S.
McCue of Oorte Madera, n said couniy,
who appeared to indorse the petition, ar
gued that a single round-trip tare should
noi cost over '2r> cents. He also com
plained that men were charged $â¢"> for
monthly commutation tickets while
women were charged but $3. It wns de
cided to communicatt with the otticers of
the two transportat ion lines.

W. J. Dingee et Al. Are Temporarily
Restrained by the Court From Sell

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,^
903 Broadway, March 10. )
A suit wa<* filed to-day against the Liv
ermore Water and Power Company. Wil
liam J. Dingee, Frank J. Moffi'.t, W. F.
Boardman, J. M. Carroll, E. P. Cook, Ed
ward McGary and James Stanley by John
Aylward of Livermore. Aylward alleges
that the defendants are acting illegally
by levying a heavy assessment on his
block of stock, which it was agreed should
not be assessable.
It is then alleged that it was agreed be
tween the plaintiff and the defendants,
Dingee and Stanley, that the latter should
incorporate a company to control the
property and sell water to Livermore and
surrounding towns. There were to be
2000 shares of the value of $100 each, and
it is alleged that Dingee was to receive
1333VÂ£ shares and Aylward 66Â«?Â£ aud that
the plaintiff's stock was to be transferred
to Stanley to be held in trust.
It is further stated that Dineee agreed
that the stock was not to be assessable,
and that he further agreed to raise $25,000,
of which Aylward was to get $2000 and
$0000 was to Be paid to Elizabeth Kodgers

the plant, so that an income of $700 per
month should be produced. It was also
agreed that the plant should be mortxaged
if necessary and later bonded for $25,000.
the surplus profits to be shared by Dingee
ami Aylward.
The complaint then states that the com
pany was formed and the promised stock
was turned over to Stanley to be held in
trust for plaintiff. According to Aylward,
Stanley was given 200 shares, and the rest
of the stock was portioned among the
other deienuants, who it is alleged were
employes of Dngee, and who did not
part with any valuable consideration for
the stock.
It is thnn allesed that Dingee failed to
raise the $2"),0u0, that all the defendant*
have not expended over $<>000 for improve
ments, and that the promised $^000 has
not been paid and that the Rod gers -mort
gage has not been satisfied as was
promised.
The plaintiff sought an injunction re
straining the defendants frons selling a
block of stock in which he is interested, and
which has been advertised for sale on
March 11. Judge Hall granted the tem
porary order.
An officer of the comnany said to-night
that the proceeding was perfectly regular,
and that the sale of delinquent stock was
legitimate.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 11, 1897.
BRAVOS FOR THE
FRENCH OPERA
Society Attends in Force
at the California
Theater.
The Season Opened With Meyer
beer's Opera "L'Afri-
Ciiae."
Massart and Henry Albers Win
the Laurels of the
Evening.
â¢'II Trovatore" had been billed as the
medium for introducing the French Opera
Company to a San Francisco audience,
but in the middle of the week it was an
nounced that "L'Africaine" would be
substituted lor the early Verdi work. The
change did not cause much disappoint
ment, for ''L'Africaine," old as it is, has
some of the charms of novelty in this City
when it has not been heard much
of late years, whereas the dear old hand
organ airs of "II Trovatore," sweet as
they are to the ears of people who love to
hum the melodies in the foyer between
the acts, have come to be associated with
amateur performances, and consequently*
"II Trovatore" has lost some ot its pres
tige for opening a much-advertised grand
opera season.
Considering the difficulty of marshaling
stagehands in a foreign language, the per
formance was laudably punctual in be
ginning. The Grst scene, representing the
council chamber of the King of Portugal,
was modestly set. It was not stage up
holstery that the audience had assembled
to enjoy, however, but grand opera singing,
and consequently the accent of lnes re
ceived much more attention than the red
benches of the council chamber. Mme.
Marthe Berthet took the part and her sing
ing of "Addio Mio Sol Natal" was received
with enthusiasm, wiich might be luokcd
upon as something of a triumph for the
first aria in an opera.
Mme. Berthet has a ringing soprano
leggero voice, although it is not free from j
a certain hardness which detracts from its
sympathetic quality. Stie sings with con
siderable freedom of execution, and alto
gether she carried off the honors on the
feminine side of the cast.
The real honors of the evening, how
ever, were all swept away by Vasco di
Gama and Nelusuo; they won nearly all
the "bravos," and it was a toss up which
of them had won most. The moment
Vasco di Gama was summoned into the
council chamber and M. Massart, in a
tight-titting costume ot red and gold,
responded, one knew he was the primo
tenore of the organization by the very way
he strutted on to the stage.
Vasco did not deign to notice, so much
hs by a glance, the august grandees, the
cardinals, bishops and inquisitors assem
bled in council; he strutte I right down to
the footlights and addressed himself at
once to the audience, witn a frank disre
gard of any one but himself which is
sacred to tenon beloved of the multi
tude.
Massart had not sune a dozen notes of
his opening aria, "Io vidi," before every
one saw that he was justified in assuming
the airs and graces ot a primo tenore a-^
--soluto. His beautiful voice, whicn gives
evidences of high training, is full and
dramatic in quality, and he pro
duces exceptionally high notes in a
chest quality of voice, or at least in
such a skillful blending of the chest and
hpad qualities that the dramatic effect of
a chest note is produced. He sings with
MLLE DE CONCOLE, the Premier Danseuse of the French
Opera Company.
little or no effort and in spite of his tight
Clothes, bis impossible strut and his petit
maitre manner, there was no affectation
ab.'Ut the genuine expression of his
singing.
Massart's aria was received with fervid
applause, and he remained the hero of the
footlights till Nelusko (Henri Albers) ap
peared and t:;en honors were divided.
Nelusko, tne noble but delusive savage,
has not very much to do in the council
chamber scene, when he is brought in as
Vasco di Gama's slave, but the full,
vibrant qualities of his voice and his fine
musical and dramatic rendering of his
score quickly revealed the artist
Nelusko has a chance of showing his
quality in the second act. w::ere Vasco di
Uama is thrown into prison with his
slaves for daring to declare that
he can reach India by rounding the
Cape of Storms. Henri Albers took
full advantage of the opportunity
offered, and his aria, "Daughter
of Kings," brought down a storm of
"bravos" and "bis," particularly from
the part of the house where a large con
tingent of opera lovers from North Beach
was seated.
All through the rest of the opera Al
bers' success continued. He acted as well
as sang with ease and abandon, and in
the scene on board ship he and the male
chorus bora most of the burden of the
MONSIEUR MASSART, the Leading Tenor, as Vasco di Gama
in " V Af ricaine."
score. Hii ballad, "Adamastor, Monarch
of the Deep," made the hit of the third
act.
Apart from Masaart and Albers, the
company did not give any remarkable
proofs of talent. 11 me. Foedor, the Selika,
was not received with any enthusiasm.
Her voice proved to bo dramatic and
powerful in the upper notes, but it is un
even, and sne does not use it with any
particular art.
Her appearance would no doubt be tak
ing and piquant with another make-up,
but the darkened skin of Selika was very
trying to tier.
M. Athes w:s neither a very good nor a
very bad Don Pedro. Both in the sinking
and" acting he just reached the standard
of mediocrtiy. PMward Deo, the second
tenor, sang acceptably as Don Aivar.
M. Javid was as fervid a Christian in
the role of the Grand Inquisitor as he was
an ardent heathen in the role of the Grand
Brahmin. The minor parts were all sat
isfactorily sustained.
As for the choruses the men's voices
were far superior to those of the women.
S>me of the male choruses in which Mey
erbeer is always so strong were very well
sung, but the chorus of women in the
third act was weak and out of tune.
A large orchestra under the direction of
M. Nicosias did efficient service. On the
whole the ensembles were good, though
there was a slight evidence of pulling
hither and thither in a few of th,e grand
ensembles. This was only momentary,
however, for on the whole good precision
was observed.
The wait* between the acts were not
long and the scenery, though simple, was
appropriate. T n the fourth tableau there
was a grand Indian mnrch, executed by
Mesderooiselles R >ssi, De Brassi, Boggio
and the corps de ballet. *
The audience was prodigal with ap
plause nnd it is many a long day since
a San Francisco theater has rung with so
many "bravos."
A "SOCIETY" HOUSE.
It Was Dressy, Chatted French and
"Visited."
It is pro Ten; no matter how great the
lyric artist, if he or she appears only in
concert San Francisco 'will have none of
it. That is, she will not don her finest
clothes and lonpest plumes to extend
greetings to a concert programme. Nor

dicaand her famous company taught us
that melancholy fact. Opera is what San
Francisco wants â opera with artists whose
fame has preceded them. Opera mounted
grandly and gorgeously, such as the Cali
lornia management offered their patrons
last ni-ht.
Compared to the Nordica audience â
latest and most brilliant in our memory
â the assemblage that tilled the California
last evening was as a brilliant meteor to a
tiny twinkling star.
K very body was there. Everybody
dressed in their very best, with added
splendor in the shape of rare and costly
laces and priceless jewels.
The opera season summoned in evi
dence the people, the hoi polloi. They
stood three deep in front of the theater en
trance and held their breath or gave vent
to joyful exclamation as carriage after car
riage unloaded its quota of fair occupants.
Another fact proved is that woman, no
matter how fair or lovely, never looks so
handsome as in the gorgeous costuming
which opera not only permits but de
mands. Society answered nobly fashion's
imperative decree, and the result was one
of the "prettiest houses," according to
managerial vernacular, the California
Theater has ever held.
The California is not a theater that is
easily "dressed." For some reason or
other costumes must be more than gor
geous, jewels raora than brilliant to make
a good showing at this house. But the
theater last evening was a dream of love
liness. Fair necks gleamed, diamonds
outshone themselves, silks rustled and
satins shimmered in a way to please even
the most exacting of tastes. Hats were
not in evidence, that is, there was not a
Gainsborough in the house, and the few
head coverings that were worn were so
tiny that thty looked more like a ribbon
or a feather or a bit of luce fastened
daintily in Ihe coiffure. The dressing was
not confined to the lower floor. In the
balcony there were rare laces to be seen,
ladies without hats and gentlemen in the
evening dress operatic performances de
mand.
Probably the fact that the comnany
haiis from New Orleans may account for
the charming custom introduced last
evening of "visiting" between acts. The
lobby formed a charming retreat, and not
a few ladies mingled with the gentlemen
and exchanged greetings and opinions.
Of course French was heard all over.
Good French, poor French and most in
different French. It seemed to be the
thing. Those who could not formulate
sentences to express the enthusiasm they
ielt gave vent to their joy and lingual
attainments in load and oft-repeated
"Bravos."

UNION MEN DISCHARGED.
Trouble May Grow Out of the Affiliated
Colleges Building.
The Laborers' Protective Association,
Hod-carriers, met at 1159 Mission street
last evening.
The union decided to again affiliate with
the Building Trades Council. The presi
dent, Patrick Hannon. William O'Donnell
and Jerry Holland were appointed as dele
gates to that central body.
A report was made that the Rae Build
ing Company, contractors for the con
struction of the Affiliated Colleges, had
discharged all the union hod-carriers and
that it was announced that hereafter non
union laborers will be employed. It was
also asserted that tbe company had taken
the same action with regard to the con
struction or the High School building and
the nev Hall oi Justice on Kearny and
Washington streets.
The union decided that as the Affiliated
Colleges is a State building the work
should be done by union men only, and
that in order to effect this end the best
thing to do is to call the Board of Kegents'
attention to the injustice. A committee
will call on the Regents before the next
meeting. â

NOBLE RED MEN
TURN INFORMERS
Hoopa Valley Indians Re
ceive Very Light
Sentences.
The White Man Who Bought
L quor for Them to Be
Arrested.
Slid to B; G3od Indians, but Very
Fond of Firewaterâ Got Thirty
Days Each.
The noble red man, represented by
three Hoopa Valley Indians, has turned
informer, and there will be wailing arui
gnashing of teeth in Humboldt County
about North Fork when it is learned lhat
they have told more than was ever before
known of the mysterious agency by which
the Hoopa ValJey aborigines get the fire
water that often causes them to put on
warpaint.
James Anderson, James Richards an<l
Milo Ferry are good Indians, according to
Captain Dougherty, the retired army oni
cer who acts as agent at Hoopa Valley,
but they, as well a? other inhabitants of
the reservation, have a quenchless thirst \
for whisky. Moreover on many occasions.yA
much to the discomfort and astonishment^ 1
of the agent, they were able to obtain the
dreaded firewater and become uproari
ously drunk.
A close watch failed to discover the
I means by which the liquor reached the
! reservation until one day when tie three
men rode into the valley with a comfort
able "jag." They were searched and
enough whisky found to make a dozen
Indians drunk.
They refused to tell where the liquor
came from and were arrested on a charge
of selling liquor to other Indians.
After arriving in tfiis City in charge of
Captain Dougherty the three men con
sidered their chances of going to jail for a
long time and then concluded that to tell
where they obtained the liquor would get
! them off with a light sentence. In this
j idea they were encouraged by the agent
and the United States District Attorney's
office.
When they were called np for trial yes
terday in the United States District Court,
' nil pleaded guilty and both Captain
: Dougherty and Assistant United
j District Attorney Schlesinger asked the
i court to be lenient with them in view of
the fact that they had given valuable In
| formation that would put a stop to the
selling of liquor to tne Indians on the
! Hoopa Valley reservation. The captain
! testified to their ; eneral good character
and Judge Morrow sentenced them to
I thirty days' imprisonment and to pay a
: tine of %f> each. They were taken to Ala
raeda County Jail last evening to begin
j their terms.
It is understood that the Indians told
; the authorities that they hired a man
from Ilock Creek, which is not far from
! the reservation, to buy the I'qnor in North
Fork, ana that be delivered the whisky to
them at a rendezvous in the mountains.
They claim not to know his name, but
nave so described him that the author
ities will have no difficulty in making his
arrest.
It is believed that this mau'-fcas been *
making a regular business of supplying \
the Indians with whisky, and that he la I
responsible for the introduction of large
quantities into the reservation. *
Hoopa Valley reservation is in Hum
boldt County, about forty- five miles from
Arcata, and is about eight miles square.
One hundred and eighty Indians make
their homes there and practically support
themselves by farming and hunting.
The barking of a dog on the earth can
be distinctly heard by bailoonists at an
elevation of four miles.LINCOLN II TOOK

racing.
A cheap collection of "dogs" started in

their way la9t night to Third streetâ
that place known to tha pioneer as
"Happy Valley," which lay behind the
sand dunes where the Claus Spreckels'
building now stands. All came to join in
the grand celebration over ihe trausforma

brought about by the combined co-opera

tenant. j
The celebration of the advent of the
electric ligh's bad been postponed time
and again because of the inclemency of
the weather until eventually last night
was the time Â»el down by the executive
committee to celebrate, weather or no
weather.
Bonthes at each of the five street cross
ings between Market and Harris n stre> ta
acted as beacons to signify that some
thing unusual was about to take place on
that street.
These signals were no fake alarms.
There wfis adis;lay of bnniintr, calcium
li^ht?, Japanese lanterns, Roman candies
and bky rocksts, with a band of music
seated in a rockaway behind four horses*,
which traversed the street from Market to
Harrison.
On the sidewalks were thousands of
persons, some of whom had not been on
Third street for years, but they turned
out iast night 10 see the old place in its
change from flickering lamps into an elec

rendezvous for all. Here the proprietor,

I UNION STOCKYARDS, iii,; March 10. â As
was expected the advance in price of cattle Mon
day started a great many ihli way, and the re
celpis to-day were about 14.600, against 9540 last
Wednesday. For the first half of the week the
receipts foot up 33,450, as compared with 26.343
for the same period in last week, and 29,669 for
the corresponding time a year ago. An increased
supply caused a weaker feeling to-day, and sales
were slow with prices generally 10c under those
of yesterday. The advance In ho{ prices has
failed to stimulate the movements of country
shippers, and supplies are fallin; off instead of In
creasing. Feeders throughout the country are too
bullish in their views to sell freely, and the
wretched condition o; the country roals prevents
a great many shippers from sending stock to
market. Only about "20,000 head reached hers to
day, against 34,169 last WeJneÃday, and the re
ceipts for the first half of the wees aggregated
75,650. as compared with 1<9.747 for the same por
tion of last week, 74,580 a year ago, and 109,951
two years ago. The market to-day was firm, and
prices advanced 5c per 100 rounds. The arrivals
ofsheÂ»pfor the first half or the week foo. up 36,
--500 hÂ«-:v< of sheep and lamb*, as compared with
37.819 for the same portion of last week, and 42,
--896 a year ago. The estimated run to-day was
14.000 head, and tra was fairly active at steady
prices.

salt- s from first hands were 15,538 bags, against
15,297. The stock on hand March 1 was 8448
ba^s, against- 9H53 bags March 1. 1890. The
world's visible supply .March 1 was 3,9J3,234
ba^s. against 3,011,655. The circular says: "The
condition of the market has not improved either
in values or volume of business. Although arrivals
are light and stocks in both first and second hands
rather below the average, the poor demand from
the interior and uncertainty as to the future offers
little encouragement to local dealers, who continue
to buy in the most sparing and careful way. Tna
rand markets appear to be In about the same
condition as our own and shipments have been
very light To-day's stock consists of 694 Costa

Mr. Manuel Off?:s Mr. Hobart
a Thousand Dollars for
Charity.
Eut the Minister Must Prove That

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
9JS Broadway, March 10. j
Although the election is over politicians
are still busy. Mem tiers of that profession
in Oakland die hard, anil so long as they
can discover any fuel to add to the fire
there will be a blaze. Now that the
chances of candidates for election cannot
be discussed everybody is explaining how
t came about that so many who consid-
SOLVING THE SECRET OF DEFEAT.
There were about 150 candidates at the municipal election and now 118 are
figuring on the value of "indorsements."
ered themselves abnormally strong came
out at the small end of the figuring.
Altogether there were about 150 name*
on the ballot. Of these 32 were elected
and 118 are now traveling the street or
supporting saloon bars or writing com
munications to the papers explaining
why they were not elected. Mayor Davie,
who.wa-i beaten by about 100 votes, hints
that after the official canvass he may dc
ci :e on a recount.
Others declare that the election boards
in many precincts were composed of too
many men of the same political faith and
ihat this iufluenced the result. Although
the District Attorney has decided that
ibis could not affect the validity of the
flection a few disgruntled ones are still
harping on that string.
The right against the saloons, however,
is the one that requires most explanation
and can only be accounted for on the sup
position that OaKiam! must have a laree
floating population. Prior to election the
ladies canvassed the city from house to
house, and according to the promises
made them about four-fifths of all the
votes cast should have been against the
saloons. Instead of that, about two-fifths
voted for closing, and the result was very
similar to that of the woman suffrage vote
of last November.
These two experiences have established
the precedent that Oakland gentlemen
keep just one-half of their promises to
lady politicians. This result, however, is
very encouraging, for it is an improve
ment of many hundred per cent on the
amount of promises that male politicians
â¦ this city keep to each other.
V Councilman Manuel became very reck
jk^s to-day. In a card published last Dight
*>v. C. H. Hobart stated that Mr. Manuel
n*d knuckled to the California Protective

sion of the Sunday closing question. Mr.
Manuel vigorously denies this and bets,
or rather offers to give $1000 to Mr. Ho
bart'.s church, if a committee of ministers
are satisScd that Mr. Manu?l did the bid
ding of the saloon men.
As it is hardly likely that such a charge
could be proved ordisproved Mr. Manuel's
money is quite paTe and the general public
will have to satisfy themselves on the
matter by the record of his vote in the
Council.
J. A. Col burn, who was beaten for Coun
cilman from the First Ward by James
Henneberrv, will fie a contest. Henne
berry'g majority was only thirty and Col
burn is willing to spend a few dollars to
try an<i overcome it.
The vote regarding the saloons taken by
wards shows that the measure carried
only in the Third and Seventh Wards. In
these two districts committee* will be
organized who will appear before the
Council and oppose the renewal or grant
ing of any licenses in their respective
wards. They contend that the result of
the v ote givt- s them the right to oppose all
efforts seeking to continue the open
saloons within their boundaries.

they were absolutely unpledged, one
might suppose that some of them bad
actualiv discussed p:itronago before elec
tion. Presumably, however, r.ot a single
thought was given to this subject until
after the votes were counted.
Comparing the personnel of the branches
of the city povernmen t-elrct with the in
cumbents, it is very reasonublo to sup
pose that there will t-e an < mire change of
those offices within the gift of the re
spective officials. Auditor Snow and
Treasurer Gilpin, who succeed ttiemselves,
will be the only exceptions.
In the Mayor's office there is little
doubt that a new expert will be appointed
to succeed Mr. Alexander. The City
Council, Judging politically, will not re
tain City Cierk Tompkins, altnougn he
has been one of the most efficient and
courteous men th:it ever held that office.
The Board of Works may probably retain
Secretary Spauiding, although there are
other candidates for the office.
Mr. Spauiding was a very earnest
worker for City Attorney Dow and Mayor
Thomas, but as he was put in by Wilson
and Peirs 1, two of the retiring members,
he will reauire much support to retain
his position.
The preat change*, howevr, will be in
the police, tire and street departments.
M. K. Miller, Superintendent of Streets,
and a Populist, cannot expect any sup
port from a Republican majority In the
Board of Works. Chief Fair of the Fire
D'partment certainly nas nothing to ex
pect from Monte Cement, the City Engi
neer, having foaaiit earnestly on behalf
of the defeated candidate, Wilson. l
rie also has no claim on Captain Thomas,
.vhose name was omitted from the card
which Jt is alleged Fair distributed
throughout his department. City Attor-
ney Dow will undoubtedly support Fair,
but his vote will avail nothing against the
Other two.
Cbie! Lloyd of the Police Department is
in a p culiar position. He is an out-and
out Populist and was e.-pecially supported
by City Engineer Wilson. Lloyd nas
mad* a conscientious Chief, but merit, of
course, cuts no figure.
Some muiuhs ago Rod W. Church was
mentioned for the position of Chief of Po
lice, and as he was a very active supporter
of Captain Thomas, in whose ward he re
sides, it is very probabie that his candi
dacy will be again put forward.
Some little interest attaches to the con
dition of the Police Cout. Judge Wood
was appointed lo the office by Mayor Par
dee and was not disturbed by Mayor
Davie when his term expired on the Ist of
January. Mayor Davis can, however, at
any time before he turns over his oilice to
Captain Ihornas next moith, make a
change and offer the police judgeship to
Justice Allen.
He declines at this time to say whether
he anticipates making any change or not.
Ahhoug i professor Burrill of the high
school has some strength in the new
Board of Education, it is hardly likely to
prove sufficient to prevent the election of
.Superintendent McCiymonds of the School
Department.
P. M. Fisher, who has been considered a
candidate, stated positively to-day that
he had no ambition whatever in that
direction.
Although there will be numerous
changes there is no candidate yet whose
name can be mentioned with any degree
of certainty in regard to any office.

Much of this stock was floated, and George

PRIVILEGE OF
SELLING AT HOME
Manufacturers Make a Re
quest That a Hardship
Be Abolished.
Cannot Compete in Their Own
State With Merchants From
the East.
Ex-sting; Laws Compel a Condition
That Seems L.ko Ccmmer
cid buicide.
Oakland Office San Francibco Call,)
908 Broadway, March lU. >'
The Board of Trade received word to
day that the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association lias indorsed the ef
forts of Oakland manufacturers to secure
the passage of the legislative bill pro
hibiting the imposing of a license upon
any person soliciting orders or selling
articles manufactured or produced in this
State.
On this bill hangs the foundation of the
municipal license system of every city in
the State. Durins: the past year Oakland
has been particularly active in regard to
licenses, and in some instances the effect
has been the reverse of what was antici
pated.
The manufacturers and producers have
now concluded that it is folly to permit
any municipality to impose a license on
the sale of home-made goods, no matter
in what part of the State they may be
manufactured.
A very emphatic letter has been sent to
every merchant in the State and to every
member of the Legislature, which sets
forth some facts of which the average
citizen is certainly in ignorance. In one
section it says that the act is simply in
tended to promote the development and
manufacture of products of this State. It
is intended to put the sale of California
produced goods on the same footing as
goods produced in other Stutes when sold
by travelers in California. The letter
says:
It seems absurd to think that California
law discriminates against its own people, but
such is really the fact at present ami tins law
is intended 10 correct just that evil. The in
tention is not to take away from the towns,
cities or counties in this State the power to
Dags and enforce the usual license ordinances.
It is inlet. only to prevent the imposition
of a license on the home manufacturer when J
he offers goods for tale through travelers, and
in the same manner as the same goods are sold
by the travelers of other States. It seems like
suicide to nut a prohibitory tÂ«x on the sale of
the pioducts of this State, when they are in
just such competition with goods from other
States. This is occurring every day in Cali
fornia, so that millions of dollars' worth of
foreign goods are sold here without let or
h:nJr:i' cc and the- California manufacturer
or producer is cringed out of existence if he
tries to sell In the .same way.
It is true that the license is not always en
forced; in fact is rarely framed with a view to
venting the sale of such, articles to the
dealers. â  But, .in&i much as this State i*
young in the matter of home products, and
inasmuch as it is necessary to encourage the
small manufacturer mid producer if we ever
expect large institutions to crow from them,
we surely ought not to allow statutes to re
main in existence whicn tend to crush the life
out of these embryo enterprises. If we do
allow such statutes to remain how can we
ever have pro.>perity for home products?
How can home products grow and prosper?
It is true that the large manufacturers and
producers can sometimes find ways to market
their goods other than by sale to the con
sumer, but we claim that every beginning
is at a disadvantage in the matter of market
ing produces and otherwise creating a de
mand that will lead to ultimate success and
growth. ia *'B>l
The contemplated law, as you will notice, is
intended to apply only \\ hero competition re
quires ii to be app".ieU, and surely the State of
California can nftord lor it* own sake to allow
this right to its own products.
Outside the boundariesof this State the Cali
fornia manufacturer is free to sell his ioods to
whom he pleasesâ ln fact, is then a free man
and on an equal footing with the manufac
turers of other States. Within the State, as
matters are at present, he iÂ« crushed out of ex
istence. For tnese reasons and many others
that could cc given this pet should become a
law at the present session of the. Legislature.
The State Board of Trade has also as
sured the local commercial organizations
that the prosecution of the bill has their
heartiest indorsement and will be sup
ported by that body.
BEATEN IN HIS CABIN.
Brutal Assault on an Old Man Supposed
to Have Money.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 10.â Stephen
Airing was violently assaulted and robbed
in his lonely cabin near Melrojse last
nigh?. Three men armed with clubs and
a revolver entered his cabin and, accord
ing to his story, took $750 from him and
left him unconscious and tied hand and
foot.
This morning Airing came to his senses
and succeeded in loosening the rope on
his feet with his teeih. He went to a
grocery-store on Bay avenue, near the
railroad track, and told his story, which
was at once reported to the Sheriff.
The injured man, after his wounds had
been dressed, said that at dusk last night
three men approached his cabin. One
man stood outside while the other two
clubbed him. One wore a mask, but the
features of none of them were very plain,
on account of the darkness. They also
took a double-barreled shotgun from the
cabin, which they searched thoroughly.
The injured man lived in a small shanty.
He worked about boats and did gardening
and other odd jobs. An examination
showed that he ha* six big cuts on ttie
head and his nose and lip are also lacer
ated.

A BRUTAL ASSAULT.
Stephen Arring, a Veteran,
Beaten, Bound and Robbed
in His Own Cabin.
Only a Smai: Amouut of Money Taken
The Assailants Cam? in a Bo it
and Were Doubt ess Sailors.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 10.â A mosi
brutal assault, accompanied by robbery,
was committed upon an old man named
Stephen Arring at Clarks Point last
night. Arring is a veteran of the late
war and lives alone nt the isolated locality
mentioned. About 7 o'clock in the even
ing he heard a noise at the door, and
opening it was confronted by two men,
one of whom, without a word, struck him
over the head wiih a clnb. He staggered
into his cabin, when both rushed in, and
with clubs belabored him most unmerci
fully until he became insensible. They
tied him to a chair, lied his feei, and then
ransacked the house, but got only $5 or
$6. After this tney built a fire, cooked
some food, and finally left, their victim
being still insensible.
It was some time before Arring recov
ered consciousness, but he finally came to,
and after a hard struggle, freed himself
from his bondd and cave the alarm. It
was 11 o'clock when Dr. Keys of this city
was notified of the case. He wetit at once
to the scene, and found Arring so badly
injured that it took him till 4 o'clock this
morning to dress his wounds. It is sup
oosed that the two robbers had been
watching Arring, who is a pensioner, and
thought he had his pension money in his
cabin, but in this they were disappointed.
They are supposed to have come in a boat,
and are beiioved to have been seafaring
men, from expressions used by them and
from their manner of tying the knots in
the rope 3 with which they bound their
victim. No clew has yet been found to
their identity.
No Annexation for Alameda,
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 10.â The
movement for a "greater" Oakland meets
with a cold receptiou in Alameda and no
one can be found who supports it. No ar
gument which can be brought forward has
any weight with Alamedans, who are al
most without exception in favor of a con
tinuance of the present autonomy of this
city, and have no desire wuatever to be
merged into Oakland cr any other place.
N o encouragement whatever is held out to
those who are agitating the question.

PLAYED FOR A
DYING COMRADE
Why Horns of Red-Shirted
Warriors Awoke East
Oakland
While Waiting for the End Mrs
Sergeant Brown Wished to
Hear the Music.
Her Fatal Sickness Was Caused by
Her D votiea to the Cause
in Haywards.
Oakland Office San Francisco Gall,)
908 Broadway, March 10. f
A very pathetic incident was made
public Mondny night when the norm of
the Salvation Army were heard on the
east side of Late Merritt, a territory which
they had never previously invadod.
I The musicans played gently in the
garden surrounding a house at Tenth
avenue ana East Twenty-second streets.
They were playing in accordance with the
wiÂ«h of one of their members, whose lease
of life has almost run out.
Mrs. Sergeant-Major Brown for many
years has been one of the most active and
conscientious workers in this city. She was
a familiar figure at the prison and in bur
rounding towns, and was everywhere re
garded with a feeling akin to affection.
She is comparatively a young woman, and
with her husband a most useful addition
to the local army.
Three years ago while conducting a
meeting at Haywards, she caught cold,
but paid little attention to it. In course
of time it developed into consumption,
and a trip Eust was taken with the hope
that it would prove beneficial. The effect
was not such as was anticipated, and a few
months ago she returned home. Requests
have frequently been sent in from Hay
wards a.skiiiL' that the kindly worker
again go to that town to hold occasional
meetings, and promising her encouraging
support. The young lolks of the town
were considerably disappointed whon
they learned tf at their mend could not
again visit them.
During the past week Mrs. Brown has
been gradually sinkine. On Monday
evenirg she expressed a desire to hear t c
army band once more, and after they had
paraded on the streets in the city, th y
look the cars and conducted a mournful
serenade beneath ihe patient's window.
The soft music attracted quite a crowd in
that neighborhood, where the. army is a
comparative stranger, and had the effect
of ereatly increasing the interest in the
sufferer.
S'Tgeant-Major Brown was the first to
introduce the work of t'.ie army into San
Qientin, and every alternate Sunday he
still continues his visits to the convicts.

BIG STORIES OF WEALTH
Bogus Yarns About the Estates
of Dsad Calif or
nians.
Foreign Heirs Seem to Think Their
Relatives Are Bound to Leave
Immense Fortunes
judge Coffee was yesterday in receipt of
a letter from Ireland asking about the
estate of John Tucker, deceased, which
was reported by the British newspapers to
be worth $100,000. It was also said that
there were no heirs in America and that
if he had any kinfolks in Ireland, the
country of his nativity, they might as well
declare the r identity and pick up the for
tune that awaited them.
All these matters were published atlarge
by the newspapers of Belfast, with com
ments on the good fortune of Mrs. A. M.
Egan. Mrs. Kiizabeth Quigley and William
Tucker, who had established their claims
to be next of kin.
Judge Coffey replied to the inquiries by
referring the correspondent to the records
in the County Clers's olnce, where it ap
pears that the estate of John Tucker is
worth less than $10.C00 and that the widow
of the deceased is in possession of the
property, with a family allowance of $100
a month.
Incidentally the noted case of Guglielmo
Martini was referred to in the following
words:
Many letters have been received touching
the succession of one GuÃiielmo Martini of
Italian or Slavonian origin, whereby it ap
pear* that ft statement has been published in
various European newspapers to the effect
that a person of lhat name had died in San
Francisco recently, leaving an estate amount
ing to $170,000,000, at:d sucftestiug that the
writers of the .etiers were entitled to share
therein as heirs.
The records of this court have been exam
inea to ascertain if any person of that name
has died leaviue a succession of any value
whatever. No such narue appears on the md x
of successions; and it Is not probab.e that any
person ol that name resident here has dieJ,
whether possessed of fortune or not Jt is
further impossible that any one possessed of
so great an amount of wealth, whether of the
name 01 Martini or not, could have passed
away In San Francisco or California or else
where in the United States without the fact
becoming notorious.
The Judge of the Superior Court cannot un
dertake to reply specially to all the inquiries
that may do directed to him, but suggests that
communications from residents abroad be ad
dressed through the proper consular repre
sentatives here, who are, us the court takes
this occasion to say, competent and vigilant
in the line of their duties, and as a rule com
municate promptly to their respective Gov
ernments any iac;s touching the successions
of aliens within their jurisdiction as soon as
such successions are opened.
It appears that whenever a man who
was born abroad dies in California his re
lations in the land of his nativity assume
that be I -ft a large fortune, and the orig

TROUBLE IN THE
HALE & NORCROSS
A Court If junction Pro
hibits the Annual
Election.
M W. Fox Now in Fossession
of tbe O.ficas of the Mining
Company.
Stockholders Cannot Vo'e Proxies for
Stock in Choosing the Officers
of the Concern.
The annual stockholders' meeting of the
Hale & Norcross Minnie Company, which
was called yesterJay afternoon in the
office of the company in the Stock Ex
cuanue building, cume to a rather sudden
termination and in an unexpected manner.
It became known early in the day that
Jeremiah Lynch, who was elected presi
dent a year ago, had tendered his resigna
tion, and the directors of the corporation
placed M. W. Fox in the chair to preside
over the meeting. When the roll was
called the representatives of 86,000 out of
tho 112,000 shares, into which the stock is
divided, answered, the majority of this
being held by proxies.
Robert R. Grayson held a number of
proxies, and after the rollcall Mr. Fox at
tempted to question him as to the amount
of stock standing in his name or actually
held by him. Mr. Gray son refused to an
swer on the ground that ai no one had
appeared to protest his answering for and
voting the stock it was no one's business
whether the certificates were in his name
or not. This was done on the advice of
his attorney, W. E. P. Deal.
At this point an injunction sued out by
M. W. Fox in a suit entitled M. W. Fox
vs. R. R. Grayson, the Hale & Norcross
Mining Company and others was served
on the meetinu.
The injunction prohibited the voting of
stock other than that actually represented
by certificates in the election that was
about to ue held. After the reading of
the injunction Mr. Fox declared the meet
ing adjourned in spite of the protests of
the o.her stockholders present. An appeal
was taken from the action of the chair,
and 86,000 shares voted to go on with the
meeting, on the ground that there was
other business to transact besides the elec
tion.
Mr. Fox declared emphatically that no
further business would be transacted, and
tinally when the stockholders had organ
ized among themselves by the election of
a secretary, and A. J. McDonald us cnalr
nian, he ioid them angrily to "get out of
here."
He was aÂ«fced why he obj cted to a
meÂ«tin<; of the stockholders, but declined
to vouchsafe an answer. The stockholders
then adjourned to room 11 of the building
and held another roiJc.aii of s'.ock, with
the result that over 86,000 shares were
rbpresented rithoot a protest being
entered aprainst its being voted.
The meeting then ajjourned, in obedi
' enci to iliu order of the court, without
Having elected officerH. A bitter legal
right will at once be inaugurated to oust
Fox from the possession of the uftica and
booka of the comrany.

FIBER CULTURE
IN CALIFORNIA
Data Produced by the
Slate Development
Committee.
A College of Commerce Advo
cated for the State
University.
W. H- Murray, Founder of the San
Francisco Journal cf Commerce,
Makes Suggestions-
An important meetine of the State
Development Committee was held at their
rooms in the Mills building yesterday. W.
M. Bunker presided at the meeting, whicli
vas called to discuss the proposition of
fiber culture in California, and the estab
lishment of a college of commerce at the
State University.
In reviewing the works of the oast eight
months, the chairman stated that ample
demonstration nad been made of the fact
that fiber culture and the manufacture in
to articles of the raw material in this
Ktate is entirely practicable.
Among trie facts cited were the follow
ins:
In 1594" San Francisco imported over
300,000 pounds of twines and netting, all
beina: ihe product of flax. Farmers pay
annually over $250,000 ior sack twines and
fish canneries over $300,000 for netting
twine?. The BCKO bales of cotton yearly
consumed by the cotton-mlis of the State
all come from Texas aud Isew Orleans.
In ISOi ever 19,000 pounds of flaiseed,
u?ed in the manufacture of Unseed oil,
w.is imported, and 31.407 pounds of flai
and hemp yarns.
The speaker also asserted that a promi
nent business man of this City lias im
ported from Scotland machinery for the
manufacture of flax, twine?, nemp and
ramie. As ?oon as the raw material can
be mrnished it will be put into operation.
A bill was introduced in the Legislature
by Frank L. Cooni b*, speaker of the As
eembly, after havine been indorsed fay the
various bodies composing the Council of
Associated Industries, tending to brine
together the various department of the
business so as to make tnem a success, but
it was found to conflict with a bill pre
viously introduced lor she benefit of the
"University of California and withdrawn.
Ihe committee has, however, urged upon
the regents of the university the impor
tance of establishing a deDartment to
carry out the purposes outlined by the
committee. A resolut on has been intro
duced by Reirent Arthur Kodgers wnich
covers the m;itter nicely.
The following resolution was offered by
Mr. Rich and adopted unanimously:
Betolved, That this committee earnestly re
quest tl.e Board ot Regents of the University
of California to promptly take such measures
it may deeoi wise to further the fiber indus
try of California, and that we pledge the
hi'ar.y support ot the State Development Com
mittee in any plans they may inaugurate.
In speaking on the subject, W. H. Mur
rÂ»y, founder of the San Francisco Journal
of Commerce, said :
â 'Mr. Rodgers' resolution, offered before
the Board of Kezents, meets with my
heartiest approval. A coilese of com
merce for the .State University is a timeiy
suggestion. It could co-op?rate in its
d'.itips with the College of Mining and the
College of Agriculture, thus benefiting in
common the mining and farming indus
tries and commercial and o:her trades.
''San Francisco should have factories,
not only lor fiber culture, but for tobacco
and linplate. Special reports could be
made, samples of articles of commercial
value placed on exhibition, and the devel
opment following would eive employ
ment to our mechanics, tend to build up ]
our cities and make a good demand for !
our horticultural and agricultural prod
ucts."
The following data as to the manufac
tures in San Francisco wers furnished by
the same gentleman :
Food products $40,000,000
.Metal 11.000.000
Textile, etc 30.00U.000
Lumber, etc 8.800.000
Leather, etc 8,000,000
Miscellaneous, or a toml Â£4,000,000
Vo.uine of trade 00,000.

THE CHINESE OASES.
They Fill Two Courtroom* and * Hall
way With Mongolians.
Two Chinese muraer cases are on trial
in the Superior Court, one in Judge
Dunne's department and another in the
department presided over by Judge
Troutt. As these courts are directij'
facing each other in t':e Larkin-street
wing of the new City Hall, the corridors
thereabouts are crowded with natives of
the Flowery Kingdom, giving the place the
appearance of the Unired States Marshal's
office in the Appraiser's building atter the
arrival of a reamer from the Orient.
â¢Lee Ah Lung, who has several alias
name attacned to him in the official in
formation, is being deiended by Attorney
John E. Richards before a jury in Judge
Dunne's court. P'or the Btate tl:ere is
quite an array of talent. Deputy District
Attorney Walu-r Hinkle is assisted by
lawyers M. M. Foote and C. B. Darwin.
Won? Long was the first witness for ihe
rrosecution. He testified that he saw
Lucy shoot An? All Chang on the 6th
of last October. According to hii story it
WaÂ« ;i deliberate murder.
"What did you do after the occurrence?"
naked Mr. Ricnards, and Wong Long
Bwnre that he walked into a restaurant
and to' k a cup of coffee.
Mr. Richards' questions shook tin story
of the witness in several particulars. He
intimated that he expected to show the
witness to be an opium fiend and not
worthy of credence.
In Judge Troutt's court Chin Ah Wan
is on trial for his li!e, charged with the
murder of Gin Lun Chee on the 4th 01
last October.
In this case also there are two lawyers
employed as special counsel for the prose
cution. District Attorney Barnes is
present in person as the representative of
the people, and he is assisted by Thomas
D. Riordan and W. \V. Foote. The law
yers for the defense are ex-Judge Robert
Ferral and Colonel T. V. Eddy.
DELAYED WILL CONTEST.
' Litigation Over the KÂ§tate of a Man
Who Died Nineteen Years
Ago.
James S. Morgan has filÂ°d a sensational
suit against Cecilia Blackburn and Daniel
Blackburn. Morgan alleges that Mr. and
Mrs. Blackburn used undue influence over
the mina of James H. Blackburn, who
died January 27, 1888, when he made his
will on Jannnry 13, 1888, and that as a
consequence Morgan was excluded from
his rightful share in the $300,000 of the
testator. He avers that the defendants
acquired $250,000 by their wrongful acts
and insists that he is entitled to a large
portion of the property. The Superior
Court is asked to determine the rights of
the several parties in the property under
dispute. ___^________

SPRECKELS
RESIGNED
A Big Upheaval in the
Pacific Coast Jockey
Club
OBJECTED TO EASTERN
INNOVATIONS.
The Club's President Will Per
manently Retire From
the Turf.
VICE â¢ PRESIDENT CROCKER
WILL WITHDRAW.
And the Association's Able Secretary"'
W. S. Leake, Will Hand in His
Resignation To-Day.
The greatest racing organization west
of the city of Chicago is threatened
with complete bankruptcy, disruption,
if, indeed, it has not already been
accomplished. There was a meet
ing of the directors and leading
spirits of the Pacific Coast Jockey Ciub
held at the Palace Hotel yesterday, the
results of which came as a thunderbolt
from a clear sky to the local and visiting
Eastern turf frequenters.
President A. B. Spreckels tendered his
resignation as president, the resignation
of Vice- President H.J.Crocker and Sec
retary W. S. Leake will go in to-day and
the resignations of Directors Androus and
Tarpey will ahortiy follow. Thus disap
pears from the California turf men who
have raised the sport in this end of the
country to its present high level.
Mr. Sprockets said last evenine that his
action in the matter was taken from the
fact that his club had tried to furnish the
public with the cleanest and best sport
that substantial purses and stakes could
afford, but that he objected to "Eastern
innovations."
Secretary Leake stated in an interview
that bis family connections had always
objected to his embarking in the racing
business and that a more prolitable busi- j
ness offer compelled him to accept.
President Spreckels will dispose of all i
of his stock in the Ingleside Association, j
as well as his large racing stable, and the j
familiar red, white and blue carried byCad- |
mnrf, Piquante, Pat Murphy and others ]
will be known no more. Mr. Leake also !
said that his stock would go as the market
went.
The Western turf has suffered an irre
trievable loss. From a barren sand
waste lnjrleside track has becomo in a
period of less than tvo years the Morris
Park of the West.
The policy of its millionaire president
nnd its directors has been to give the pub
lic high-class and clean sport. It was the
ilrst track to dispense with the poveriy
breeding entrance fee that kept poor un
fortunate platers munching on straw and
their owners walking about in rags. Its
munificent stakes have been the talk of
the turf world. In return the public re
posed the utmost confidence in its officers
and the play ai Ingieside was tremen
dous.
Captain J. H. Rees of Memphis, a gen- I
tlemau of wealth and honor, presides in i
the stand with J. W. Wilson of Sacra
mento as associate judge, and the decision
of these gentlemen was never questioned ;
by the big crowds.
If racing for glory constitutes a gentle
man sportsman, A. B. Spreckels was the
one pre-eminent in this section of the
country. With millions at his command,
Mr. fcJDreofcels did not seek to win every
event and stake on the card at the course
over which he held the office of president.
With a tine stock farm in Napa County
well stocked with the choicest of brood
mares and several se ect stallions, he took
great pride in watching the youngsters
grow up until they were old enough to
carry the colors. With only a fair stable
of horses, none above mediocrity, he de
fired no races made for them, no weights
adjusted, but entered them in races along
with horses of the poor owner and gener

ECZEMA ON HANDS

Hears of CUTICURA. Husband

First Application Gives Perfect
Ease in Five Minutes, and
a Night's Sound Sleep.
My hands were completely covered with
Eczema, and between my fingers the skin was
perfectly raw. I had to sit with both hands
held up, and away from the fire. My husband
bad to dress and undress me like a baby. I
tried the best physicians, but their medicines
gave me no relief, and drove me almost crazy.
I was advised to try Cpticcha Remedies,
and did so, although my husband had to go
twenty miles to get them. As soon as he got
back, I used the Ctjticdka (ointment), and
five minutes after the' first application I was
perfectly fasy, and slept soundly all that night.
Before I commenced using Ccticcra Reme-
dies I could get no ease night or day. I could
not bear to get warm, it would put me in a
rage of itching. I always keep Ccticuha
Remedies in my house now, and recommend
them to everybody, because of their wonder-
ful effect. Yours gratefully, .

erally had a commission on them regard
less of tne odds.
Sometimes they won, oflener they did
not. Still this did not dull the appetite
of this generous patron of the turf.
In a great measure much of the success
of Ingleside can be attributed to the inde
fatigable efforts of this hard-working, far
seeing secretary, \V. B. Leake. Mr. Leake
came from Sacramento a complete
stranger to the turf, but in a short time
mastered its many curves and intricacies
and became a power.
In fact, bad he continued in his unex
pected vocation he would undoubtedly
have acquired National reputation, for he
displayed ability in turf affairs far above
the average. Through his far-seeing
policy Ingleside wa9 enabled to make
a wonderful financial showing at the end
of its inaugural meeting, and it is ?aid
with another meeting it would be entirely
out of debt.
The Corrigan-Uilroan-Gunst faction will
probiibly now guide the interest of Ingle
side track. The Chicago-St. Louis clique
of horse-owners which have visited tins
coast for a couple of seasons have not cre
ated the best of impressions. They have
brought their own jock ys with them, and
these riders have demonstrated the fact
they and their employers were not of yes
terday's crop of wate-rmelons.
They were cherry-ripe, right off the
vine. If we are to have a Hawihorne-
Roby-ldeai Park regime of racing, this
noble sport will be placed in a mound
alongside of the National game of base
ball â now dead several years through
taking.
The resignations created the greatest
commotion among turfmen and book
makers, c.nd Ingleside track stock at once
took a tumble. The gentlemen in ques
tion were very popular in turf circles, and
general regret was expressed that internal
dissensions should have occurred. Many
of the horsemen said sorrowfully, ''This is
my last winter in California."
Senator S. N. Androus, who is one of the
directors of the Pucitic Coast Jockey Club,
and who last evening arrived from Sacra
mento, was a good deal surprised at the
resignations. He said the club had been
so prosperous and Mr. Spreckels and Mr.
Leake had so lonsr devotedg themselves to
it that tne changes came with force, though
he was one of the directors.
"Mr. Spreckels has certainly furnished
great entertainments for the public," tie
said, "and made a great bus;ness success
of the track. He had the complete conti>
dence of not only myself but of all the
directors."
As to what was now proposed, he did
not desire to be quoted.
Captain James H. Rees said he knew
littJe about the matter, and preferred not
to give an opinion, except that of most
horsemen, that Spreckels had furnished

THE HUDELSON LIBEL.
Judge Campbell Gives Kxpression to
Hi* Di<guÂ«t at the .Prolonged
Hearing.
The long-drawn-out preliminary exam
ination of Benjamin F. Hudelson, on the
charge of criminal libel, was continued
before Judge Campbell yesterday after
noon.
The defendant was again laced on the
stand and Attorney Woodworth asked ;
him a number of questions as to what
took place before the judiciary board of
the American Protective Association.
The Judge several times objected to the
irrevelant questions' put by Woodworth,
and once when WooUworth argued the
point the Judge tersely remarked, "It's
useless to talk French to a turkey," and
shut off further discussion.
M. T. Brewer was then called as a wit
ness and he testified as to Woodworth's
proposition regarding the sale of the
mine and other points covered by Owen
in his testimony.
While Brewer was being cross-examined
by Woodworth the Judge interrupted and
adjourned court, saying that he was sick
ol hearing so much irrelevant matter.
"I nave given you all the latitude I
could," said the Judge, "but there must
be an end to it some time or this case will
never be finished. The introduction of
all this outside matter does not cut any
figure with me and 1 fail to see why it
should be persisted in. If properly, con
ducted, this case could be settled in half
an hour." /
The hearing will be resumed on
! March 17.
THEODOBE PAINTER LOSES.
Judgment for Â»:{J,a'>4 44 Kntered
Against Kirn by Judge Troutt.
Judge Troutt of the Superior Court yes
terday handed down an opinion in the
noted case of Painter against Painter,
wherein the interests of the Painter Type
Foundry business have been for so many
years in litigation.
The decree of the court gives judgment
I in favor of Caroline A. Painter and E. B.
' Dallam, executors of the last will of Je
\ rome B. Painter, and against Theodore P.
i Painter for $33,224 44 and for one-half of
i the real estate of the partnership. It was
I ascertained by the court that Jerome B.
: Painter was not indebted to his firm at
I the time of his death in 1883. An imme
diate report and accounting is calied (or
irom the receiver.
As is customary where relatives are ar
rayed against one another in litigation,
the legal fight has been very bitter, ex
tending from the year 1883 to the present
time. An exception to the rule, however,
appears in the fact that the estate has not
'â  suffered material loss, but on the con-
I trary has actually increased in value,
j being now worth something like $80,000.
HOLBROOK CHOLERIC.
! Bad Entanglement of the Affair* of the
Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children.
Affairs of the Society for the Prevention
I of Cruelty to Children seem to be in a bad
I rix, even threatening disruption, la ad
j dition to cutiing Secretary Welch's salary
! $10, it was decided at a recent meeting to
' remove from his position Special Officer
: Holbrook, also on the p!ea of economy.
Holbrook will make a statement of his
case to the directors in a few days. He
blames Welch for the action taken by the
directors.
Sister Julia, the great charitable worker
who presides over tiie Siielterine Arms, is
also opposed to Welch, stating in written
I charges that "lie is no >;enUeman" and
her society would not affiliate with his.
As she has given shelter to many infants
picked up by the society until they could
be cared tor her action has hampered Mr.
Welch's body not a litue.

Appointments to Evening School Posi

The Board of Education last evening
had a very lively session. The matter of
contracts for the Mission High School was
disposed of after a discussion In which |
Director Derhara questioned the leeal |
right of the board to rescind the contracts I
made by the preceding board. The action
recommended oy the Committee on Buil l
ings and Grounds was taken. Director
Head objected vigorously to the appoint
ments recommended by the Committee on
Evening Schools, which meant, he said,
the adding of six new teachers to the de
partment who were not on the substitute
list. One of these is Madison Babcock. |
who had a position made for him at once j
at a salary of $100 per month. Director j
Head also introduced a memorial to the
California delegation in Congress, which
was adopted, and to which the signatures
of the president, secretary and all the
Director? will be appended. The text of
the memorial was as follows:
To the Honorable California Delega
tion, Fifty-fifth Conijresa, Washington,
D. C. a Gentlemenâ The Board of Kdu
cation of Sau Francisco do request of
you that you uÂ«e your utmost endeav
ors toward having: the new Postottlce
building to be built in thia City, com
menced at once. The lurk of proper
postal farilitie* are well known to all
citizens* and the proper time has now
arrived for the united California Dele
gation to rotifer with the new Secretary
of the Treasury and insist that the su
pervising architect should finish the
plans for a new building and begin ac
tive operations for the commencement
on the building of the sume, thus re
lieving many of our unemployed me
chanics and laborers by giving them
the meant of making a livelihood for i
themselves and families and erecting a
monument to the Government of the
United States which shall show to the
people of California the generosity of
the Government. The public service j
needs the new Postoffice and we are |
certain that your efforts in our be
half will bring forth from the Govern
ment a prompt action in the com
mencement of the (..i mp. Trusting
that you, gentlemen, will attend to
this as soon as convenient, we have
the honor to remain, your obedient
servants.
A report concerning the contracts for
the Mission High School was made by the
Committee on Buildings and Grounds.
The committee found that the contracts
of the Rae Building and Contracting
Company and Sweeney & Co.'s contract
for plumbing were legal, but there were
some contracts declared to be illegal, these
being as follows: Hindes & Co. for inside
blinds, W. Morgan & Co. for heating and
ventilating apparatus. The committee
also recommended that Peck, Williamson
& Co.'s bid for heating and ventilating
apparatus should be accepted. These
recommendations were adopted in reso
lutions.
When the report of the Committee on
Buildings snd Grounds was reached Di
rector Head said thiÂ»t the proposition to
rescind a contract entered into by the
preceding board was a serious matter. It
was a mutter, in his opinion, to be settled
by the courts. He was opposed to the
recommendations of the report also, be
cause they would tie up the construction of
the Mission High School.
The report was adopted, Director Head
alone votinsr no.
Director Derham spoke against award
ing the Peck-Williamson contract, as the
committee recommended. Mr. Derham
said that the way to free the board from
any possible suspicion of jobbery was to
submit the matter to the courts. The
resolution was adopted, only Directors
Armer, Derham and Head voting no.
A resolution was adopted substituting
wooden laths for iron laths in the con
struction of the Mission High School, to
bring the cost within the appropriation.
A resolution was adopted providing for
a committee on secondary education, not
withstanding the objection of Director
Derham, chairman of the Committee on
Classification. The committee will exer
cise general supervision over the high
schools, technical schools, commercial
schools and classes of special instruction
in the schools.
A resolution was also adopted, on mo
tion of Director Gallagher, authorizing
the Committee on Rules to bring in any
amendment to the rules that it may see
lit.
The Committee on Evening Schools sub
mitted a report recommending as follows:
Tuat Madison Babcock be elected principal
of the Franklin Kvening School and detailed
to act also as principal ot the Mission and
Richmond evening schools, the latter two
schools having no prineipa.s; also appointing
Mia Kate A. Humphrey to a position in the

Wilson Tunnicliffe and Dr. Bunneil as
teachers.
Tne l'oint Lobos Improvement Club
asked that a new school be established in
Richmond.
Miss Fannie L. Soule asked to be retired

of the rules of the department was

COLLEGE RIVALRY.
Stanford Accepts Berkeley's Challenge
to an Intercollegiate Clee and
Mandolin Club Contest.
Berkeley has challenged Stanford to an
intercollegiate musical contest, the first
event of its kind in this country, and Stan
ford has accepted the challenge.
The contest will take place in this City,
probably at the Baldwin Theater, on the
evening of university day of the Golden
(iate Carnival, May 7. The participants
will be the big glee and mandolin clubs
of both universities. The judges will be
chosen from Hie recognized local authori
ties on music, and are to give ihe decision
on the merits of the contesting clubs.
Both musical bodies have attained a
high standard, both are eminently repre
sentative of ihe universities under the
names of which they have become known
to a wide circle of admirers.
Berkeley starts with a slight advantage
I in probably having anticipated the con
test before she issued the challeng â . Stan
ford's musical clubs made an extended
tour of the Northwest during the Christ
mas holidays, and got much valuable
practice from actual performances before
I critical audiences, and since then have
given a number of concerts in this part of
the State. Berkeley's Glee and Mandolin
clubs, larger and better than ever before,
made a tour of Southern California dur
ing the holidays. Both have some fine
individual talent, and a good deal of
rivalry has long existed between them.
The Stanford organization upon accept
ing the challenge immediately decided
upon the following strict rule governing
candidates for the musical ciubs that are
to represent the cardinal: "Every mem
ber missing a rei earsal without good ex
cuse will be dropped regardless of his
ability. No excuse but for sickness or
necessary absence from the university
will be accepted."
Stanford musicians who have been per
manently chosen are: McNeil, Abbott,
SawalJ, Bush, Schneider, Lanagan, Kauf
man, Sutherland, Kiley, Decker, Young,
King, Kaathoven and McGuire. Ana
these are accepted conditionally: Brun
ron, Claire, Strohn, Morgan, King, Frost,
Macy, Ross, Morrow and Connick.
OLD-TIME PUBLICATION.
A Copy of the First Paper PriDted on
the Pacific Coast I- in the
Free Library.
There is in the private office of George
T. Clark, the librarian of the San Francisco
Free Public Library, and which may be
seen upon request, a rare publication. It
is a coiy of the first newspaper published
on the Tacinc Coast, and with it are other
issues of the same paper.
It is the Oregon Spectator, the first num
ber of which appeared in Oregon City, Or.
Ter., Thursday, February 5, 1846. It was
issued by the Oregon Printing Company,
J. Fleming, manager, and edited by W. G.
T'Vault. The papers in the collection run
from the date ol the first issue to and in
cluding the 20th of January. 1848. These
papers contain much of interest about the
early history of Oregon, and they were at
one time the property of the Rev. R. E.
Parrisb.
The Oregon Spectator was issued several
months before the rirst Caliiornia publi
cation, whicu was the Californian, which
first appeared at Monterey on the 15th of
August, 1846. On the first page of the.
Spectator is published the organic laws of
the Territory and a remedy for the blues.
On the editorial page the editor in double
leaded type declares his principles and has
a sub-editorial in which there is a call for
a city corporation and the advice to the
Mayor and Trustees to "die up the
â  tumps, erade the streets, tax dogs, pro
hibit hogs and advertise in the Spectator."
Among the advertisements is one that
calls for the Masons in the district to
attend a meeting for the purpose of mak
ing arrangements to apply for a charter.

The Amount NÂ»l Kxtortionate
In the case of Margaret J. Barry against the
St. Joseph's Hospital and Sanitarium of the
Sisters of Mercy of San Diego the Supreme
Court yesterday rendered a decision affirming
that in favor of the defendant made by the
lower courts. The plaintiff', as administratrix
of the estate of John M. Little, deceased,
brought action to have a deed ot three pueblo
lots canceled, on the ground that at the
time of execution the grantor was, on ai count
of illness, unfit to attend to any kind r>f busi
ness. The lots were valued at $2000 and
deaaed for $500 and Little's keep for life. In
case he left the hospital he was to pay $40 a
month for board, lodging and medical service.
He recovered, but failed to pay anything, and
sui I was brought for the property at his death.
The court ruled that the transaction was legiti
mate and fair.

Charges Made by the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children.
They Are Characterized as False and
Malicious and an Infamous
Ca'nmny.
The remarfcs made by President Sonntag
and Directors Gilbert Palache and P. B.
Flint, at the meeting on Tuesday of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children, regardinz the alleged difficulty
experienced by the society in getting from
many of the police courts even the co-op
eration specified by law, formed the subject
for vicorous replies from Judges Conlan
and Campbell yesterday morning.
It was charged that warrants had been
refused, that jury trials in Judge Camp
bell's court were farcical, the jurors being
bums around the police courts, and that
the Judges and people around the courts
got passes 10 the theaters.
Judsre Conlan, as soon as court was
opened, referred to the charges and char
acterized them as ialse und malicious. He
said that if the remarks had been made in
his presence outside his courtroom he
would have characterized them in much
stronger language.
"I have no acquaintance with Secretary
Welch," continued the Judge, "and want
none. It is untrue that warrants have
been refused in my court, and those mak
ing such a statement Knew it to be false.
"The trouble with the officers of the so
ciety is that they want to dictate to the
Judges bow a case s.iaU be disposed of,
irrespective of law, justice or equity, and
because they are denied that privilege
they make a cowarJly attack upon the
Police Courts. What the society wants is
not prosecution, but persecution.
"The charge that Police Judges have ac
cepted tree passes to any theater is, as far
as I am concerned, another malicious
falsehood. I have always given strict in
junctions to mv bailiff not to accept any
passes of any kind, and when I attend any
theater I pay mv way like other persons."
Judge Campbell, alter opening court,
said:
I think it is my duty to remark that I
noticed in the morning papersâ the Chronicle
and The (."all â an articie lrom the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and 1
was very much surprised indeed to see such
an article, for the reason that accusations
referring to Police Judges not doing their duty
In regard to issuing warrants for the society to
have persons arrested for cruelty to children
have been made. It has always been my cus
tom, and I believe every person that practices
here will bear me out in the statemeut, to
issue warrants. This court is particularly
selected by the agents of that socieiy to pro
cure warrants, and I have never yet refused a
warrant in those cases. I have now about
twenty-five defendants on my list, who are
paying from $2 50 to $5 a week for the support
of their children.
In regard to their saying that there were a
lot of bumsâ Police Court bumsâ on the jury
of the Tivoli case, those gentlemen, I believe,
are all merchants, regularly summoned by the
Police Departm' ntâ all doing business in this
City â and I think it is an Infamous ealumuy
upon those gentlemen to call them Police
Court bums, aud also to me to say that I re
fused on any occasion to issue warrants for
this society. I issue a great number of war
rants, and have now at this time a great num
ber of cases on my calendar that are carried
over from week to week so as to make them
support their children, which they have re
fused to do, and I force them to do it.
I think they ought to be a little better
posted before they make public accusations
against Police Judges in the public press.
Tnoy certainly must be iniormed by some
one. The officers of that society select this de
partment of the Police Court particularly for
j that purpose, and they evidently propose to
i threaten and buildoze Judges into doing
things that they think they ought not to do.
They make a mistake in this department witli
mp. I can be led, but not driven. '
There are two different societies that have
made this mistake now. The other is the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association.
This is twice now that they have made these
mistakes and published them to to the worldâ
that the eouns were not doing their duty.
They would better come here themselves and
see how the cases are conducted and perhaps
then they would be better satisfied. I know,
however, that the officers of this society nave
all been perfectly satisfied witn my work in
regard to the matter.
Judges Joacnimsen and Low have yet to
be heard from.
