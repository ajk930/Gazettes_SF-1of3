GREEKS DRIVEN
FROM DHOMOKO
BY THE TURKS
After a Terrible Slaughter the
Sultan Agrees to an
Armistice.
EUROPE SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF THE MASSACRE
Pitiable Failure of the Powers to Hold the
Moslems in Check After Causing
Greece to Consent to
Mediation.
(Copyrighted, 1897, Dy the Â»w York Snn.J
LONDON", England, May 18.â Tne war
is at an end, and tne sdanie, not of Greece,
but of Christian Europe, is complete.
The final act oi the Moslem army was
not battle, but massacre. Two thousand
Greeks at Dhomoko, according to meaner
accounts received here, were slaughtered
by Edhem Pasha's troops after the pow
ers had forbidden their opponents to en
gage in further hostilities, under a pledge
that they would restrain the Turkish
forces. Even the bloody record in Arme
nia does not match this crowning dis
grace and defiance flung in the face of
united Europe by the grinning creature it
maintains on the gory throne at Constan
tinople.
And then, with splendid insolence, hav
ing accomplished his entire purpose, tde
Sultan sent a message to the representa
tives of the powers to-day saying, as an
earnest of his amiability and spirit of ac
commodation, he would abstain from
further hostilities pending negotiations
for peace.
Ihe history of mankind, verily, has
nothing to compare with this sublime
triumph of evil over the forces oi right
eousness, which federated Europe assumes
itself to be.
The Sultan openly declared he would
not check his army until Dhomoko, on the
old frontier, was in his possession. All
Thessaly is his now beyond dispute, and
he intends to retain it.
Possession is much more than nine
points of the law in diplomacy in Europe.
Accordingly all the expressions of public
opinion during the past few days have
been unanimously against him. If mere
words would drive him out he would have
to go, but few persons believe these will
be of any avail. Nothing but force re
mains, and Europe is so mortally afraid of
her own weapons siie will submit to almost
any indignity ra;her than use them. Such,
at !ea=t, is the sentiment that controls the
policy of Great Britain, which is the
strongest of all the powers. The impo
tent rage of the English Government over
the desperate dilemma into which its pol
troonery has le-.l it is both pitiful and
amusing.
The Times, the proudest Tory of them
all, denounces the Sultan's "cynical in-
Eolence" and declares its "resentment is
moderated only by contempt." War al
ways has been and should be master in
stead of diplomacy. The attempt to make
it a tool in the present case has been an

The San Francisco Call
I ignominious failure. It has been pre
vented from spreading, but it has made
the problem that it was expected it would
simplify vastly more complicated and
I difficult.
This is true both in Turkey and Greece.
I Revolution in Athens, can now be avoided
i only by a miracle. The Government suc
ceeded in concealing the full knowledge
| of yesterday's disaster at Dhomoku until
I to-night. The effect of the revolution is
awaited with the keenest apprehension.
! The cenditious for a revolution are more
i aggravated than they were in 1870 in
\ Paris. The Greek people are of much the
: same temperament as the Parisians. The
popular rage and grief is indescribable
and it is impossible to believe tnat they
j will keep within bounds.
The news from Athens to-night is pain
j fully meager. The Government gave the
I :ullest publicity to the announcement of
' an armistice late this afternoon in order
j to offset the effect of the disaster, which
| was made known in fragments. To-mor-
I row, however, will be a critical day for
i Greece and the present dynasty.
Regarding Turkey it is useless to specu
late. It may be taken as certain that
nothing s-hort of extreme measures will
induce the Sultan to iorogo the fruits of
victory. Any indispenable preliminary
i to these measures must be a change. in
j the attitude of Emperor William. This
erratic sovereign is sometimes more
â  amenable to civilized influences than his
' colleague at Constantinople, but his posi
tion constitutes one of the grave difficul
ties of the situation. So long as the Sul
' tan believes he has the moral support of
I the Kaiser he will continue to defy Eu
! rope. The hour has now come when the
fine hand of Russia may be expected to
appear. Tne Czar's influence, and his
alone, is potent both in Berlin and Con
j stantinople. Should the situation prove
beyond Russia's control, then, indeed,
must the nations prepare for great events.
DEFEAT AT DHOMOKO.
Greeks Said to Have Lost 2000
Before a Retreat Was
Ordered.
ATHENS, Greece, May 18.â The report
of the evacuation of Dhomoko by the
Greeks is confirmed. The left wing of the
army was turned, after which the right
wing yielded to the assault by the enemy
and a general and extremely disorderly
retreat of the Greeks to the mountains of
Othrys to the southward ensued.
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, MAY 19, 1897.
DHOMOKO AND ITS CITADEL AS SEEN FROM THE SOUTHEAST.
[Draivn by a "Call" artist from a picture in the London Illustrated News.]
A private telegram says the Turns have
occupied Armyros, but this is doubted in
official circles. â¢
General SmoJenski's brigade has re
treated to Gardike, twelve miles south
west of the Gulf of Volo, and is destined
thence to Stylida, where the troops will be
embarked in transport ships. Crown
Prince Consta:itine is at Phurka Pass, ten
miles south of Dhomoko on the road
across the Othrys Mountains.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon nothing had
been heard here of the conclusion of an
armistice. If the armistice is not pro
nounced within two days it is the inten
tion of the Government to *Â£pt*! l 0 tue
people, calling (he whole nation to arms
to rescue the fatherland.
ROME, Italy, May 18.â The military
attache of the Italian legation in Athens
telegraphs that the battle at Dhomoko re
sulted in an irreparable loss to the Greeks,
who iost half of their artillery and had
2000 killed. The same dispatch says that
General Smolenski's brigade was out
maneuvered and divided into two
columns, one of which retreated to Gar
| dike and the other to Stylida, hoping to
eÃcape by sea.
LONDON, Esq., May 18.â No account of
the battle at Dhomoko from the Turkish
side has yet reached London.
Official and officially derived reports
from Athens persist in stating that the
Greek loss was only two or three hundred,
and that the retreat was effected in good
order.
Fears are expressed by the Sun's cor
respondent of a big slaughter, which
seem, however, to be well based.
The Athens correspondent of the Stand
ard, evidently suspicious of a massacre,
says the public has been so often deceived
that they no longer greedily shallow
every of good news that officials
vouchsafe them. The official statement
that everything was safely removed from
Dhomoko, except one heavy cannon,
seems incredible. Despite the welcome
fact of a cessation of hostilities an anni
hilation of the hopes rained by Monday's
account of great successes has caused' pro
found depression. This feeling hitherto
has been so deep that although there is
intense anger against the members of the
ministries and generals, and above all,
the Crown Prince, there ii no visible ex
citement and there has been no renewal
of the demonstrations which followed the
earlier disasters.
The correspondent adds that the Crown
Prince's persistently evasive replies to the
Government respecting the casualties
during the fighting and his assertions
that every Turkish troop was repulsed
with heavy loss have male the blow of bis
ultimate announcement of the retreat
from Dhomoko necessary al! the heavier.
The Ministers could not imagine why if
all the positions were held as the Crown
Prince reported there could be any rea
son for evacuating a position of enormous
natural strength and so strongly fortified.
They, however, telegraphed to the Crown
Prince, he being on the spot, that he must
be the best judge of the necessity of so
grave a step. If he considered the salva
tion of the army demanded a retreat be
must assume the whole responsibility.
A dispatch to the Daily News from
Lamia describes the battle at Dhomoko
as most desperate. Under cover of a
heavy artillerw fire from eight of the
largest caliber field batteries and two
mountain batteries the Ottoman infantry
advanced on the Greek intrenchments at
the foot of the Dhomoko hills. The Greek
center and left repulsed the attack by an
apparently murderous artillery and in
fantry fire. The battle was hottest Irom
3 o'clock in the afternoon until dark.
At 6 o'clock the wheat fields in front of
the Greek trenches were strewn with the
Turkish dead. Just before sundown the
Turkish reserve infantry advanced with
flags flying and heavily charged the Urenk
center, bat were repulsed with what
seemed fearful losses, the Greeks
throughout having the advantage of much
higher ground. The Tnrks, however, suc
ceeded by dint of mas es in driving back
the Greeks' right, commanded by General
Mastrapas.
This induced the Greek staff to order a
general retreat upon Derven Karya and
Phurka Pass. The retreat began at mid
night, the Crown I'rince leading, and
ended at 10 o'clock this morning. Excel
lent order was maintained. A small force
of Turkish cavalry followed the Greeks
Home distance, about 2000 yards in tbe
rear, but did not engage, .o rearguard.
The Greeks are now in a position on the
old frontier which is considered impreg
nable. The News' correspondent says the
Gieek losses were under 200.
PROCLAIMED BY HAMID.
An Official Announcement by the
Sultan of the Suspension of
Hostilities.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, May
18. â It is officially announced that the
Sultan has proclaimed a suspension of
hostilities with the object of showing bis |
good will toward ths powers.
Representatives of the powers have
been unofficially informed that the
Porte is willing to modify its demands
upon Greece, thereby granting to the pow
ers what Turkey must refuse to the van
quished and arrogant enemy. Edhem Pa
sha has been ordered to cease hostilities.
ATHENS, Greece, May 18.â The Turks
have hoisted a flag of truce at Imaret, and
sent delegates to Arta to arrange the
terms of an armistice.
POWERS TO BLAME.
They Did Not Restrain the Turks
After Greece Consented to
Mediation.
LONDON, Eng., May 18.â Greece has
sent a note to her foreign envoys calling
attention to her acceptance of mediation.
It snys the diplomats promised to act
promptly. Nevertheless t;.ey achieved no
practical result. The Turks availed them
selves of the delay to strengthen tneir
positions in Kpirus and Thessaly, with the
object of surrounding tne Greefc troops,
forcing the latter to accept battle where
the enemy had every advantage. Despite
its conviction, whi^h was communicated
to the diplomats, that Turkish inaction
was only preparatory to a fresh attack,
the Government, trusting the powers not
to allow the Turks to derive any advan
tage, consented to order the troops not
to take the offensive. Nothing was done
to intercept the enemy's communications
or to construct fortifications menacing
their positions. The consequence is the
Turkish attack on Dhomoko forced the
Greek army into a position for which the
Government cannot accept the responsi
bility. That position was due to the obli
gations the Government undertook at thu
instance of the powers. The note con
cludes by requesting the envoys to draw
the attention of the powers to the state of
affairs and demand prompt and efficacious
action on their part.
ATHENS, Greece, May 18.â All the re
maining troops in the city, with the ex
ception of the royal guard, have gone un
der Colonel Vassos to join the main army.
SALISBURY'S SYMPATHY.
Says His Kindly Feeling for the
Creeks Cannot Protect Them
From Follies.
LONDON, Eng., May 18.â Salisbury pre
sided to-night at a dinner given by the
Junior Constitutional Club. In Lib ad
dress he made sign ili cant references to
the trouble in the East. He said the Sul
tan under pressure from the powers, and
I especially Russia, had consented to a sus
pension of hostilities. 'J his would give
time to reflect and negotiate, but it did
not seriously diminish the difficulties of
the Giseco- Turkish problem. Neither the
Sultan nor Greece could have any illusion
as to the feeling of Great Britain. It was
impos>ible for the powers to allow Chris
tian communities to pass from Christian
rulers and fall to the Sultan's Govern
ment, which many years' experience had
shown was such that the public opinion
of Europe could not tolerate. But it must
not be imagined that any special abnor
mal sympathy had been interposed to
protect Greece lro:n tbe natural results of
her unworthy, unwise and unjust follies
and errors. There were many sympa
thies of Great Britain for Greece, for
which Salisbury declared he had the high
est respect, but these were personal and
cotild not be suffered to guide the policy
ot the nation, which must Oe ruled by in
ternational law, justice and the high duty
imposed upon it. In conclusion the Pre
mier declared that the nations were pur
suing a course most likely to lead to the
maintenance of the peace of the world.
OSCAR B. LEWIS SELECTED.
Will Superintend the Construction of San
Francisco's Public Building in
All Probability.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 18.â Upon
the recommendation of Congressman
Loud, Oscar B. Lewis will be appointed
| superintendent of construction of ihe San
l'ranci-co public building, provided be
can successfully pass the civil service ex
amination. He is a friend of Mr. Loud
and the Congressman has given him a
fluttering indorsement. Mr. Lewis re
sides in the Western Addition of San
Francisco. He has been a foundry man
and molder and a house contractor.
The Call correspondent had another
interview with the supervising architect
of the Treasury to-day, who said : "I see
that some of the San Francisco news
papers are inclined to doubt the correct
ness ot the dispatch printed in The Call
to the effect that work would soon be.:in
on the new public building. lam glad to
be able to say to you to-day that the plans
and specifications will be completed much
sooner even than I thought. Whan you
were here last I said I thought they would
be ready in thirty days, but I am told by
the engineers and draughtsmen that they
will be completed in about a woek.
"Within to weeks we expect to have the
work 'on the market.' By this I mean
that in about two weeks the advertise
ments for bids for the work of excavation
and fonndation will be published. These
advertisements will run for about four
weeks, or until about June 28. The con
tract will be awarded as soon as possible
after that and work begun immediately.
Our advertisements for bids for demolish
ing the buildings now on the Sevonth and
Mission street lot is now running in The
Call, and the bids for this work will be
opened on May 28."
OBJECTS TO PAYING FOR WATER.
Mexican Consul at Chicago Thinks He Is
Exempted by (he
Treaty.
CHICAGO. 111., May 18.â Felipe Ber
riozabal, Mexico's Consul, has protested
aaainst paying the water tax, believing
himself exempt under the treaty of 1883.
Berriozabal received a bill from the city
rua nesting the payment of $6 80 for water.
To-day the Superintendent of the Water
Bureau received a formidable communi
cation from the Consul's attorney in
which the treaty of 1883 was quoted to
suow one of the special privileges being
that a foreign Consul is to be exempted
from the payment of water taxes.
He referred the question of interna
tional law involved to the corporation
counsel. Recently a similar claim was
made by the German Consul's secretary,
who asked to be exempted from the pay
ment oi a dog license fee in accordance
with the treaty.
Pilgrimage to Historic Point*.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., May 18.â A
party of members of the Society of the
Daughters of the Revolution to-day made
an historical pilgrimage to the point on
the Schuylkill River in Merion township
wnere 119 years to-night Lafayette crossed,
escaping from General Howe, who was in
hot pursuit. The family graveyard of
David Bicking, who made the paper for
the Continental Government, and the
Nerion meeting-house, built 202 years ago,
were also visited.
TREATY OF PEACE
WITH THE YAQUIS
Mexico Concludes Terms
With the Tribe of
Indians.
Young Warriors Favored the
Continuance of Incessant
Warfare.
But the Counsel of Chief Matdonado
Prevailed and Great Benefits
Will Follow.
ORTIZ, MExrco, May 18.â The peace
conference between tne Mexican Govern
ment and the Yaqui Indians was con
cluded to-day, after a three days' session.
The conference resulted in a formal rati
fication of the treaty of peace between
the Indians find the Government by the
terms of which the Indians accept lands
in several ty and yield their claim for the
remainder of a vast area, tor the control
of which they have been waging a bitter
war tor years, killing hundreds of inno
cent settlers and driving out Federal
troops whenever they sought to suppress
violence.
This gathering of Yaqui Indians is the
most notable and picturesque ever seen
in Mexico. Cbief Maldonudo told the
Mexican officials the younger braves of
his tribe were in favor of continuing the
war for the retention of their lands, but
he had counseled them to accept what the
Government offered and become peaceable
citizens.
The Mexican officials assured the chief
of the tribe that they would receive every
protection and assistance and never have
any cause for complaint.
The pacifying of the Yaquis is a highly
important event for Mexico. This is the
! first time they have ever acknowledged
the tribe to be subject to the Government.
Their war has been continuous. Their
lands are the richest in gold in Mexico and
Indians are known to own and operate
pold mines of fabulous richness. They
have kept a strict guard on their terri
tory and no one but members of their own
tribe are known to have ever lived to
penetrate the interior of their rich coun-
"SAY, WHO ARE YOU?"
That Question Asked by a Parrot Badly
Frightened a Southern Pacific
Train Robber.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., May 18.â A com
pany of Texas rangers and a po*se of dep
uty sheriffs arestiil pursuing the Southern
Pacific train robbets, trailing them to
ward Mexico. The Wells-Fareo Express
Company will make no statement of their
loss, but it is believed to be very heavy.
Express Messenger Joyce states when
one of the robbers started to go into the
express car a parrot cried: "Say, who are
you ?" Tire robber dropped to the ground
and pointing his pistol into the car said :
"Hands up, hands up, or I'll fill you full
of boles."
"That's only a parrot," said Joyce, and
the robber laughed and said : "Tne blanked
tbing scared me almost to death."
The robbers left several hundred dollars
in Mexican silver money behind.

Morgan's Belligerency Resolution
Causes Interesting Arguments
In the Senate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 18.-When
the business of the morning hour was dis
posed of in the Senate to-day's calendar
was taken up and many bills upon it were
passed. The final conference report on
the Indian appropriation bill was agreed
to, a compromise naving been reached on
the Utah Gilsonite amendment. The con
siderrttion of the calendar continued until
2 o'clock, thirty-five bills having been
passed, when Morgan's Cuban belligerency
resolution was taKeo up.
The pending motion was that of Hole
to refer the resolution to the Committoe
on Foreign Halations. There was a great
display of interest among the Senators
ami crowded galleries aa Mason of Illinois,
noted as an entertaining speaker, took the
floor. Mason said fee would have little to
say about the international law aspect of
the case. That was as changeable as timÂ«.
He stood in the Senate to lift his voice in
behalf oi carrying out the Republican
party's pledge to reply to the appeal of
the people and to strike a b.ow for liberty,
i'o prove, as he said, that the hour had
come for th^ passage of Morgan's resolu
tion, Mason read from the President's
Cuban message to show the actual condi
tion of things in Cuba.
"Who forced 800 Americans into starva
tion ?" he asked. "Whether it was the
Spaniards or the insurgents, it is plain
that war exists. If it, does not exist, then
it ought to."
"Eight hundred starving Americans in
Cuba," shouted Mason, "and yet we boast
of the power of the United States to pro
tect its citizens."
With biting sarcasm he referred to the
fear of certain Senators to do anything an
noyinj: to Spain. At this applause broke
out in the ga^.'ery, and it was checked by
tne Vice-Presidem'fl gnvel.
Mason described the condition of the
starving and outraged Americans and
scored the minority of the Senate for pre
venting action in their behalf. The Sena
tor had newspaper accounts read to certify
to the existence of a legitimate Cuban
Government, dwelling at length upon its
workings.
Wellington interrupted to ask if this
kind of evidence is to be relied ur-on to
prove the existence of a Cuban Govern
ment.
"If Cuba holds her Government under
the trees with only the stars of God over
it," replied Mason, "I am for that Govern
ment jusi the same."
Gallineer interruDted to submit an of
ficial document printed by authority of
the Senate to prove the actual existence of
a Cuban Government.
"A Government on paper," shonted
Wellington.
"That's more than Washington had at
Valley Forge," replied Mason.
Wellington insisted that back of Wash
ington was the Continental Congress, and
with much passion he charged Mason
with falsifying history for the benefit of
the Cuban insurgents.
Mason replied that Wellington shouldn't
get excited, and repeated that Washing
ton had only a paper government at Val
ley Forge, and a paper, moreover, not
worth a continental . "We propose
to give yon what Washington gave the
English at Valley Forge,' ' he shouted.
At this the applause was so great that
the Vice- President read the rule against it
and warned the spectators against a repe
tition.
Wellington repeated his charge that
there had not at any time been a legal, re
sponsible Government in Cuba, and de
clared that Mason's speech was baaed on
the romance of fiction.
Mason quoted from the Cameron report
to prove the existence of a Cuban Govern
ment, which was made, he said, before
Wellington and himself became states
men. He referred to the business men's
petition favoring action in behalf of Cuba,
and said he would continue to stand on
that platform "while my name remains
on the payroll." He attacked with keen
sarcasm the assurances of the Spanish
Minister, as quoted in the Senate, that the
situation in CuDa had been exaggerated,
and sneered at the crocodile tears caused
by the remembrance that Queen Isabella

pawned her jewels to get money for Colum
bus' voyage of discovery.
Then he had the business men's peti
tion read at the clerk's de^k, so it
â would be inserted in the record, with all
the names, as part of his remarks.
"Some Lafayette will be found to lead
Cuba to victory and freedom," he shout
ed, "and all we are asked now to do ib to
treat Cuba as we treat Spainâ honestly
and justly."
He referred to alleged letters sent from j
ex-Assistant Secretary of State Roclchilli
instructing Consuls to give a pro-Spanish j
tone to their reports, but said that in view
of Rockhill's reported denial he would
not make the letters a part of the offi
cial record. Neither Rockhili nor any
body else could deny, however, the facts
set forth in the President's message,
which, the Senator intimated broadly, were
received long ago from the United States
agents and purposely withheld from the
Senate and House.
"I get my Cuban doctrines from St.
Lcuis," he said, "aDd I adhere to them."
He then savagely attacked the minority
for filibusterins and threatened to retali
ate in a way to make them sorry. The
Republican party never broke its pledges
v.hen it had the legislative power to fulfill
them. The Cuban plank of the last Na
tional convention, written by Lodge and
which was adopted while the rafters rang
with applause, must be lived up to and
the Republican Senators who seem to
have gone to sleep and forgotten their
pledges must arouse themselves in Cuba's
cause. Mason read striking instances of
Spanish outrages upon Cuban insurgents.
Would ti-is great, powerful nation submit
to such things? He was opposed to war,
but if war were to come as a reply to the
notices o: free America that liberty ana
humanity shall prevail and Cuba be free,
then in God's name let war come. When
Mason sat down there was a burst of ap
plause Bnd Hoar arose to reply.
"I expect," he said, "to retain that re
spect for the constitution I have sworn to
re.opect and which the Senator from Illi
nois seems to despise. I shall also main
tain mr re-pert for what he calls that
barnacle, international law."
Cuba, Senator Hoar said, was sar
rounded by a sea controlled by a Spanish
fleet, and the only effect of the Morgan
resolution is to declare while the present
condition exists that Spain can search our
snips at sea at pleasure and that Ameri
cans in Cuba shall have no claim against
Spain for damages of any kind. Hoar
practically accused Mason of being ignor
ant of the true nature of the resolution
and intimated that whether he was a fili
buster or not the pending resolution would
i c unacted upon for months to come.
Hoar told the Senate mat in his opiuion
tue President should be asked by Congress
to use his good offices with Spain to bring
about peace in Cuoa. This measure, he
said, was what the Republican platform
meant. He would ascertain officially all
the facts and then demand that Spain
âºâ¢top the war or see it stopped by the
United States. He accused Mason of
"bragging" and "shouting" and "sput
tenner.'' In his opinion, the belligerency
resolution was like a mosquito, "very
much buzz, very little sting."
At tbe conclusion of Hoar's remarks
Galiinger toot the floor in favor of the
resolution. He attempted to get some
sort of an agreement as to when a vote
would be taken, but the anti-Cuban Sen
ators, under the leadership of Hale, con
tinued their filibustering tactics and with
plausible excuses prevented an agreement.
Hawley spoke in opposition to the pass
age of the resolution at this time, and
during bis remarks Mason and Hoar be
came involved in another dispute as to its
effects. Hawley desired, he said, to pro
test against this flippant talk of war by
those in Congress, many of whom refuse
to vote for coast defenses.
"Let us first prepare for war," be said,
"before we bring it oh."
The Senate then went into executive
session.
POLICY OP JHE PRESIDENT.
He Will Offer the friendly Offices of the I
United State:
NEW YORK, N. V., May 18.-The
Herald's Washington special quojes a
"prominent Senator very close to the
President" as outlining the Cuban policy
thus:
"The first step of the President is to
afford immediate relief for American citi
zens in the manner indicated in the mes
sage yesterday. Next will be a tender of
tbe good offices of the United States to
bring the war to an end through the
medium of diplomatic negotiations.
"This step will be taken when Special
Commissioner Calhoun has made a report
on the exact situation. The President
expects Calhoun will substantiate all that
Lf-e and other consular officers have said
regarding the deplorable condition of
flairs and the inability of Spain to crush
tbe rebellion.
"This report, coupled with the petition
received to-day from many prominent
business men whose interests have been
â¢e-iously affected, will furnish the basis
for an exhaustive note to be sent to the
Madrid Government. It will be friendly
in tone, but firm in its insistence that the
War shall be brought to a close. It will
make a formal tender of the good offices
of the United States, with this end in
view.
"If the mediation of the United States
is accepted the President will suggest that
the independence of the island be brought
about through purchase. If this is re
fused the President will adopt rome plan
for a more active intervention. The Presi
dent does not now favor the belligerency
resolution. Developments in tbe island
may cause him to change his mind, but
he finds nothing in the existing situation
which would warrant such action."

THE SUGAtt SCAADALS.
Jteluctance Shown by Senators to Make an
Investigation.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 18.â A special
to-day says that the Senate is moat re
luctant to take up tbe sugar scandals.
This is 30 apparent that Tillman Bees his
opportunity and is preparing to pitch in
viciously as soon as the Cuban debate
ceases to monopolize the Senate's atten
tion. /
Tillman is ready to cause a whole lot of
trouble. He is going to comment on the
fact that stories are baing freely circu
lated about Senators dabbling in sugar
stocks now, despite the fact that Have
meyer and Searles are to come up for
trial.
Meanwhile Broker Elverton R. Chap
man is in jail in Washington for refusing
to answer questions which were asked
him nearly three years ago.
The President is reported to be in great
distress over tne situation. A majority of
the directly affected Senators and many
others have asked for the pardon; the
powerful sugar interest is working for the
broker's discharge; many prominent men
above suspicion are expressing sympathy
with him, and the argument is used that
Judge Cole in sentencing him imposed
the minimum penalty, as Chapman re
fused to answer questions on tbe advice of
his counsel that he had a legal right to
do so.
What the President will do is still un
certain.
BUNKOED IN NEW YORK.
An Englishman on the Way Back Re
hevtd of All His Earthly
Possessions.
NEW YORK, N. V., May IS. -The
police have a well-dressed Englishman in
their custody. He was able to give his
name to-night as Charles Restrow and said
lie arrived Monday from Los Angeles on
his way to England.
He hÂ«a a steamship ticket on the Teu
tonic sailing to-morrow. This is about
all he possesses, he says-, aside from Â» new
straw hat and a si v*Mop cane. He would j
not have had the ticket if it had been in
his pocket, but his passage was paid in
advance and the purser of the boat
iias me ticket Restrow is 43 years old.
He has been livine in California four
' years and left Los Angeles May 12. A
| letter found in his pocket requests rail
road conductors atone the line of the
Southern Pacific to "take care vi him, as
he is a stranger in a strange land and lia
ble to bunko and other games."
At 10 o'clock to-night Policeman Ward
found Restrow ir a drugstore in Hudson
street looking over the directory trying to
find "Isaac." The druggist called tl>e
policeman's attentcn to him, saying the
gentleman was lost. The crowd in front
of the door told the policeman the man
had been bunkoed. Restrow himself said
he did not know where he was.
"You see I am perfectly sober," he
"for I'm not a drinking man. But
I'm green in this bloomin' country and
can't find the name of the hotel where I
stopped last night, nor can 1 find the
gentleman I gave my trunks to. He told
me his name was 'Isaac,' but there's so
blooming many of them I can't find
which it is. He said he was baggagemas
ter of the Cent re port road and tnat he
would take care of my baggage."
The policeman took Resirow to the sta
tion-bouse. There the stranger made in
quiries for "Isaac," whom he met at the
hotel on Broadway, and who took every
thing but the cane and hat.
Captain Petty seat a policeman to the
steamship agents and there learned the
passage ticket awaited Restrow's arrival.
A woman had telegraphed passage money
:rom Los Angeies. That was all the steam
ship folks knew.
"Who is the woman?" asked the cap
tain.
"She is the lady who came over here
with me," said Hestrow, "but she won't
go back." Upon the captain's advice
Restrow spent the night in the police sta
tion.
7O MAKE GOOD CITIZENS.
Reformer* From All Sections Meet in
Convention at -^anhrille,
NASHVILLE, Ten*., May 18.â A large

United States Capitol." The convention
opens this afternoon and will continue for

NEW QUARANTINE OFFICER.
Passed Assistant Surgeon M. J. Rosenau
Is Detailed for Service at
This Port.
WASHINGTON, P. C, May 18.â With
the approval of the President, Passed As
sistant Surgeon M. J. Rosenau of the
Marine Hospital service has been detailed
for duty a? Quarantine Oificer at San
Francisco to enforce tbe rules and regula
tions promulgated by the Secretary of the
Treasury. It is stated at the department
that the quarantine regulations of the
treasury, as well as the local regulations,
have been repeatedly violated by tbe
lecal officer; that the local authorities
made no provision for the necessary dis
infection of vessels and personal apparel,
nor tbe isolation and treatment oi the
afflicted, and the local officer otherwise
had snown himself incompetent. This
action of the President ib taken at tbe
solicitation of the State Legislature of
California, the Chamber of Commerce of
San Francisco and the Board of Health.
Dr. M. J. Rosenau, who is stationed at
Angel Island, had not received any offi
cial information last evening of the orders
from Washington. It is probable that the
City Board of Health will still maintain
Dr. Chalmers in his position as local
quarantine officer. When the Legislature
soupht to abolish hto office the San Fran
cisco Board of Health resisted the
measure.
Some time ago the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company was advised by the Treas
ury Department that the company ships
would not be permitted to enter at the
Custom-house in this City unless the bills
of health were approved by the Federal
Quarantine Officer. Tbe health authori
ties of the City, of course, would be power
less to dock a steamer in opposition to the
Federal authority, but it is contended that
ihe local board could refuse a landing to a
ship that had been duly passed by the
United State" officer.
There would be a conflict should the
local board attempt to establish a more
rigid government than tbe United States
Government exacted. Physicians who
have studied the subject take the view that
the United States' authority will not be
questioned. Dr. Chalmers may be per
mitted to adviÂ«e, but the orders of the
United States officer will be obeyed.

MYSTERY OF A SKELETON.
Ghastly Discovery Made by Workmen In
an Underground Passageway at â 
St. John.
ST. JOHN, N. H., May 13.â This city
has a profound mystery on its bands,
which from present indications will never
be explained. â -. â¢
Workmen while excavating on the prop
erty occupied by the Thome warehouse,
which bus been taken by the St. John
Street-railway Company, came upon a
secret subterranean passageway in the
rocs. -
The workmen, while removing part of
the debris in the passageway to satisfy
their curiosity, found a skeleton of a man.
The passageway is about six feet wide and
encased with wood. It runs a long dis
tance in a southerly direction and is
twelve feet below the su face of the street.
The skeleton was found in the midst of a
quantity of lime. The teeth werj black
ened with age and some of the bones had
succumbed to the devouring influences of
the lime. The fleshy tissues were en
tirely gone and the remains bore evidence
of having been place<i there years before.
The city officials say that the passage
way is not an old sewer and that it never
could have been used as one. It was con
structed by private individuals for some
secret purpose. It is sud that at this point
1 190 years ago, and less, smugglers plied a
I busy trade, and many a cask of rum and
bale of silk was mysteriously brought in
past the customs officials. Many believe
that this structure was an important fac
tor in the evasion of customs officials.
CANADA'S COAST DEFENSELESS.
Senator David Mills Sounds a Not* of
Warning That the Country Is
Not Protected,
OTTAWA, Ont., May 17.â Senator David
Mills has sounded a note of warning re
{ ? pectinj: the defenseless condition of the
i Canadian coast cities, with the exception
> of Halifax and Victoria. He thinks neither
I the Government nor the country fully
! comprehends the critical situation of the
j empire, and considers it of greater impor
tance to provide for adequate coast defense
I than to spend vast sums of money on a
railway through Crows Nest Pass, or s
fast Atlantic steamship service. He says:
'"Tbe seaboard towns should be placed
in a position to resist any attempt to seize
them by surprise and to prevent an inva
der from even temporarily occupying them
I for the purpose of levying tribute."
Mills is a leading Liberal Senator, in
touch with the present administration.

Riches.
From a Prison Cell He Directs
the Attack on the Dead
Man's Will.
The Putative Son of the Late Cap
italist Awaiting Trial on a
Serious Charge.
VENTURA, Cal., May 17.â The briefs
of the lawyers were filed yesterday before
Judge Williams auent the demurrer of
the proponents to the contest of the will
of Antonio Sciappa Pietra. That is the
contest now being made by Michael An
tonio Ortegaâ for there have been other
contests of this will, and the story of the
litigation forms an interesting bit of his
tory. The contestant, c Spaniard of
36 years, is now in jail at Los Angeles
awaiting judgment in the Supreme Court
upon an appeal from a conviction in the
lower court of a brutal crime with which
! he was charged by a young girl.
The estate in contest is valued at about
> $500,000. Antonio Scieppa Pietra was at
I one time one ot the principal figures in
| ti e affairs of this county. There were
i three brothers Sciappa Pietra, and they
were all in business together, but the
name of Antonio Eciappa Pietra stood for
the firm. This was true to the extent
that the others were recognized merely as
employes o' the dominating head of the
concern. When Frederico dropped dead
one day in 1867 it was supposed that he
left nothing. Great was the surprise,
therefore, when Antonio weut inio court
and announced that the dead man was a
I full partner and owner of the one-third of
the firm's asset?. The firm was engaged
in sheep-raising on a large scale and mer
chandising. Frederico was unmarried
and Ins estate went bacfc to his brothers.
One of the present contestants of An
tonio's will is a young woman who claims
the relationship of nieco, as having been
the daughter of the unmarried Frederico.
Her name is Minnie R. Danner, and her
! contest is, at least for the time being, out
of court through the granting of a motion
of the attorneys for the proponent to
strike out the essential paragraphs of her
petition. The granting of the motion
practically Hilled the petition,; and no
new move has since been made by her at
torneys, who are in San Francisco, where
she also resides.
Antonio Sciappa Pietra went to Italy
for health and recreation early in 1895,
but found neither. He was overtaken by
| sickness, and on February 1 died at lie mo.
I It was not until a year afterward, in Janu
j ary, 1896, that his will, leaving nearly all
j of his estate to his surviving brother Leo
\ poldo and creating him executor, was pro
bated. No voice was raised in objection,
and a decree of distribution was filed at
the end of that year, in December. Still
no objection was made until the last days
in which, under the law, a contest could
Ibe filed. Miss Danner was the first to ap-
I pear upon the scene on January 1 of this
year, -and on the ISth of the same month
came Michael Antonio Ortega.
Miss banner, as stated, claimed to be
{ the daughter of the brother Frederico, and
because of her not setting forth her claim
in proper shape she is now out of the
held.
Ortega claimed to be a legally recog
nized son of Antonio, accepted into his
! family as such, although Antonio was not
i married. The proponents of the will
! formally deny this and offer in support
I the record of the famous old Mission of
! San Buenaventura, which sets forth that
Michael Antonio Ortega, said to be the
contestant, was baptized there by the
officiating priest on September 30, 1861, as
the natural son of Vicente Ortega and
Carlotta Bravo.
However this may be, there are many
citizens here who acknowledge having
been familiar with the claim of young
Ortega for years, and before the death of
Antonio Sciappa Pietra, that he was the
son of that wealthy citizen. It is said to
have been quite commonly accepted as
true.
Ortega was convicted three months ago
at Los Angeles under the name of John
Lee of a criminal attack upon a girl. He
has appealed from the judgment to the
Supreme Court, and, pending the decision
of the higher court, is in jail in that city.

them proposed that the commons be
transformed into an Arizona prairie and
that the serious task of impersonating
cowboys and Indians be assumed by the
boys.
The proposal met with general approval.
Some of the iads stuck feathers in their
hats and became Indians, while others
turned their coats inside out and assumed
the swaggering roles of cowboys.
A midnight attack was planned by the
Indian-, and in the course of the attack
John Shim p. a cowboy, drew his revolver
and shot Charles Harvey in the ab
domen. Harvey fell to the ground in
great agony and several of the boys ran
for medical assistance.
A careful examination by the physicians
gave the result that the boy was fatally
wounded anÂ« could not live many hours.
Shimp. of course, is very sorry that it
happened. He says he did not know the
pistol was loaded. The authorities, how
ever are not disposed to deal very Jen
iently with him, and it is probable that
he may have to stand trial for his worse
than criminal carelessness.

Alarming Aspect of the Tailors' StrikÂ»
in yeiff Torfc City.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 18âTha
strike of the tailors is assuming enormous
proportions. The indications are that it
will spread to other cities if the strikers'
reports are to be believed. Twenty-two
thousand tailors, asserting that their
families are starving, are now strikine.
The East Side is in a ferment. StriKe
leaders say that 35,000 workers will be nut
before the end of the week. The trouble
has been brewing for some time and many
people wonder that the strike did not
occur long ago. The tailors have a very
strong organization ami they are very
popular with other organizations and it is
more than probible that a sympathetic
str.ke may result. If such a sirifea does
happen there will be thousands more
destitute families in New York added to
those who are already in need ot food.
Judging Iron present appearances
neither tb<Â» strikers nor the employers will
yield unless some very important conces
sions are made.

William Inglis Elected
Mayor by a Large
Majority.
The Republican- Democratic
Combine Carries All

Defeat of the American Protectve
Association Ticket Is Over
whelming.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 18.â The town
has gone wild w.tb. political enthusiasm
to-night. Cannon are booming, anvils
are being tired, and crowds of Republi
cans and Democrats are marching the
streets arm in arm to the strains of brass
bands that are parading with thousands*
of citizens. The victory for the fusionists
in the municipal election is the cause of
the demonstration. The joint ticket of
the Republicans and Democrats defeated
the Citizens' candidates, as the nominees
of the American Protective Association
â¢were called, by an overwhelming ma
jority. Not a single nominee of the
American Protective Association was
elected.
Two years ago the American Protective
Association, under the name oi the Non-
I'artisans, defeated both the Democrats
and Republicans, boih of wnich parties
placed straight tickets in the field. Since
then the entire city government has been
in the hands of the order. To overthrow
the dominant power, for the first time in
the history of the city the old-line parties
this year joined issues.
The returns were received at the joint
quarters of the Republicans and Demo
crats to-night, but the committeemen ad
journed lone before the complete returns
were in, as it was evident that the fusion
ticket had carried everything before it
The offices of the Mail and Independent
were serenadad, and the enthusiastic sere
naders went out to the aristocratic portion
of the city and played before the residence
oi Mrs. L. Clare Davis, the only woman
on the ticket, and who was elected by a
large majority as School D. rector at
large.
The successful ticket follows:

WASHINGTON POPULISTS' UKASE.
Fusion Denounced, and Senator Marion
Butler Scored for Selling Out
His Party.
TACOMA, Wash., May 18.â During the
last session of the State Legislature the
middle-of-the-road Populists broke loose
and quietly formed a separate State or
ganization. L. E. Rader, iormerly editor
of the Tacoma Sun, was made president,
and the other officers of the organization
were divided among prominent Populists.
To-day they issued an address calling
for five district conventions, for the pur
pose of selecting ten delegates to the Pop
ulist convention, which is to meet at Nash
ville on July 4.
In this address they denounce fusion,
and unmercifully score United States Sen
ator Marion Butler for selling out the
Populist party.
They claim the Populists were bunkoed
in all tbe fusion deals, and declare that
the only way to carry out their reforms is
to remain a distinct and separate organ
ization. To these district conventions
none will be admitted who do not un
equivocally indorse the Omaha and St.
Louis platforms and the Ellensburg State
platform and are known as old-time
Populists.
The general impression here is that the
desire for this separation is not unanimous
among the Populists, but that enough are
in favor of it to make a serious split in
the fusion forces and greatly help the
Republicans to capture the State. The
district conventions are to meet prior to
June 30.
ROMANCE OF WALLA WALLA.
Young Bridegroom and His "Best Man"
Arrested for Swearing Falsely to
the Bride's Age.
WALLA WALLA, Wash., May 18.â
August Englehart, a German living near
Hadley in thii county, swore out a war
rant to-day for the arrest of James Shearn
and T. H. Lenark, on the charge of r.er
jury. Lenark was arrested and the offi
cers are now looking for Shearn.
This is the outcome of a rcmanlic mar
riage which took place in this city on
Saturday night. During a band concert
at the Courthouse young Shearn snl liiaa
Amy Englehart presented themselves at
Clerk Mullinix's office and said they
wished to be married. They did not have
a marriage license, hut the Auditor was
founa and issued one. A minister wa->
summoned and performed ti.e ceremony,
and the newly married couple left tbe
office. No more was thought of the mat
ter until the girl's father came to the city
and made the complaint against Shearn
and Lenarfc.
For some time Shearn had been a suitor
for ;he girl's hand, but her parents ob
jected. On Saturday she left home, osten
sibly to vim friends in this city, but met
ShÂ»arn and came witii him. Lenark ac
companied them and made affidavit that
the girl was of legal age, and thus he, too,
is implicated in the perjury case.

DEL MONTE, Cal., May 18â The ex
tensive improvements that have been in
progress at Hotel del Monte have been
brought to completion with most satisfac
tory results. To-day the management out
into effect the contemplated change from
tue American to the European hotel plan.
Instead of having one' immense dining
room there are now rive rooms of varying
eizes and uses in which meals are served.
The cafe, which merges upon the piazza
and is inclosed in glass, and is beautifully
finished and furnished,; and the ; grill
room, which occupies the space that was
formerly the ladies' reading-room, and is
also handsomely furnished and decorated
by expert fresco artists, have a separate
frill be!-->w them in the basement of the
hotel. ; Tnifc grill is fitted with an odorless
pa? range and an apparatus for absorbing
and dissipating all the odors of tin cook
ing. The breakfast and lunch rooms,
across the main corridor to the right of the
main dinin -room, are entered through a
series oi iour anterooms, all of which are
niost tastefully decora'.ed, and these
smaller rooms will be used for dinner also
when there are comparatively few guests
at the hotel. No table d'hote meals will
be served hereafter.
LAST DAY IN MARIN' S JAIL
Colonel Finnegan's Attorneys Confident
That He Will Be Released This
Morning.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., May 18.-This is
the last night that Colonel Peter A.
Finoegan will spend in the Marin County
Jail. He will go free in the morning and
Mrs. Emiiy B. Finnegan will not receive
the $730 ordered to be paid to bei by Jud^e
Angelotti. Finnegan's attorneys say that
Judge Angelotti can but give the colonel
his freedom, and they insist that Mrs.
Finnegan will not be paid.
The public may thmk it strange that
Colonel Finnegan can afford to keep his
daughters at the Hotel I>a!a->1 and yet
plead beiore the Superior Court of Marin
County for his liberty upon the grounds
that Le is a pauper and unable to raise
enough to pay Ins wife's alimony; yet
the attorneys for Colonel Finnegan state
that his sworn siatemeut filed with
County Clerk Thorna* B >nneau is true, and
that be has not committed perjury, lhe
amount of Colonel Finnesan's indebted
ness to his wife is now $1050 and this sum
will not be realized from the assets for
some time to come, if at all.
Colonel Finnegan's last night in jail is
like any other. Tbe prison fare, heaped
on a sinple tin plate, is not what he re
ceives. He eats the best and washes it
down with wine and such liquid refresh
ments.
SAXTA FE EMPLOX ES WARSKD.
Railway Men Hay i>o< Engage in Any
Vuttide Speculation*.
ALBUQUERQUE, N. Mix., May 18.â
President Ripley of the Santa Fe system
lias just issued a "warning" to all em
ployes of the railroad. It takes the form
of a circular and has been freely dis
tributed in Albuquerque and other points
where large numbers ot railroad men
make their homes.
The gist of the warning is contained in
the first section of the document, which
altogether is quite lengthy. This section
is as follows:
The entire working time of all employes is
paid for by the company and must be devoted
to its interests. No officer or employe will be
permitted to engage in other business occupy
ing any part of his time or requiring his at
tention, without the express sanction of the
undersigned in writing.
The other sections of the document go
into the details of what is meant by
"other business," and seem to even object
to speculation in real estate. The little
side issues in which most railroad men
are interested more or less are all tabooed.
In referring to the matter the Albu
querque Citizen says that the new order
is simply mystifying and likely to cause
confusion as well as loss to a number of
men.

Theatrical jnananer I*. G. Waldron
Pa**** Away Unattended at -fright.
EUREKA, Cal., May IS.â D. G. VVaid
ron, manager of the Zera Specialty Com
pany, was found dead in his bed at the
Vance House this morning. Waldron re
tired lust nigbt in bis usual health, but
when his partner, L. P. Sanford, attempted
to awaken him this morning he could get
no response. When the door was opened
Waldron was found to have been dead for
several hours.
The company played at the Occidental
Pavilion last night, but trie remainder of
the engagement has been canceled.
WaJdron's wife lives at 218 Stockton
street, San Francisco. The body was
taken south to-day.
Waldron was a native of New Hamp
shire, 64 years old. He had visited all
parts of the world, having been in the
show business forty years. This company
which he was managing on the present
trip was organized in San Francisco
several weeks ago.
CATTLE TO It IHE JUKO*.
Steamer Load to tie Shippad to Alaska
from Puget Sound.
SEATTLE, Wash., May 18.â John Dal
ton. tbe pioneer Alaskan, arrived on the
Al-Ki this morning from Juneau, and will
at once begin preparations for shipping
back a cargo of livestock, to consist of 100
head of beef cattle and ten horses. The
steamer Satjta Cruz has been chartered lo
sail from Seattle on June 6. It is proposed
to take the cattle into the Yukon. They
will be shipped to the head of navigation
and thence sent across by way of the Dal
ton trail. A second herd of about the
same number will be taken in some time
in August.
Willis Thorp and one or two others have
also announced that they propose driving
cattic into tbe Yukon this season, so it is
probable that tbe gold hunters will have
plenty of fresh beef, provided they can
afforJ to pay the prices.
A.4.V JOSE MORTGAGE VOID.
Trantfer of Property by fruit-Dealer
Anderson Set aide.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 18.â The mort
gage given, by J. Z. Anderson, an insol
vent fruit dealer, to the California Fruit
Transportation Company for $48,000 a
month before his failure was set aside by
Judge I. origan to-day. It was contended
by George W. Cozzens, the assignee of
Anderson's estate, that the mortgagor de
frauded the other creditors in order to
give the California Transportation Com
pany a preferred claim. The decree as
prayed for was granted. .' '*;?Â£%:
In January, 1896, Anderson failed, the
liabilities amounting to $160,000. A month
prior to this time he and his wife gave the ;
$48,000 mortgage to the company. The
property involved comprises over six acres
of land on which the Anderson fruit dry
ing and packing plant is situated, at the
corner of Cinnabar and Montgomery
streets, valued at about $40,000. '

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAT 19, 1897.
NOW IS HANFORD
DOUBLY BLESSED
With the Knights of
Pythias Comes the
Valley Road.
Workmen Lay Rails Over the
Boundary Line of the
Convention City.
Rejoiclnar in Their Good Fortune,
Citizens Are Lavish In Hospi
tality to Their Guests.
HANFORD, Cal.. May 18.â The Knights
of Pythias gathered here from all over the
State, and the Rathbone Sisters, the wo
man's branch of the same order, are being
overwhelmed by the hospitality of its
people. Grand Chancellor McGlashan's
statements in responding to Major Hicks'
address of welcome exactly fit the case.
"You have not merely hang the latch*
string on the outside," he said, "but you
have pulled the string out ana given it to
us."
Hanford is enjoying the thrill of pecu
liarly exciting days in her history. The
city is not only being overrun by a big
body of representative men and women
from every Quarter ol the State, but the
city limits were crossed this afternoon by
a body of workingmen bringing their
work with them, and that work marking
an epoch in the town's onward and up
ward march. They were laying the track
of the San Joaquin Valley Railroad. Only
a few months ago a great part of the pop
ulation of the city refused to believb that
the road would ever come to Hanford, but
the most stubborn doubter has been
changed into the most enthusiastic be
liever by tne presence of the track itself.
So the reception to the Knights, which
is to continue through the week, will have
a climax placed upon it by a grand cele
bration on Saturday of the completion of
the Valley road into the city. The pro
gramme for the weet embraces street
parades by day and music and dancine by
nijrbt, with receptions, exhibition drills
and drives through this land of vinefl and
wines between times. With all the temp
tations to outdoor enjoyment with which
I the Knights and Sisters are being sur-
I rounded, those who attend the formal
business sessions of the Grand Lodge and
the temple will deserve more than ordi
j nary credit.
The Grand Lodge convened promrjtly at
I 9 o'clock this morning. One hundred and
i seven paÂ«t chancellors were admitted to
! membership. At 10 o'clock the doors of
I the lodge, which is in session at the
] opera-house, were thrown open for the
! Mayor and city officers.
Mayor Hicks took the platform and for
-1 mally welcomed tne delegates to the city.
Instead of the stale old key proposition,
ne said, he presented Grand Chancellor
McGlashan with a latchitring in the form
! of a plaited riboon of festal colors. In his
remarks Mayor Hicks said:
Probably no fraternal organization has met
with more marted growth within the past
quarter of a century thnn the Knights of
Pythias. The very name of your order as well
as the work it does appeals to the sense of
right, and for men to be banded together to
maiutain lowaid each other the relations
whicn existed between Damon and Pythias ot
old is the highest standard oi earthly brother
hood. 1 am also reminded that your order
through its auxiliary, the Uniform Rank, has
become a military factor recognized by the
Nation, and shoulda ioreign foe appear upon
our shores an arinv of Knights as brave at> any
that honored knighthood of old will meet
them and defend the stars and stripes.
iiut, best ot all, I am reminded that your
order, true to its progressive spirit, has taken
women into its fraternal homes, In tbe persons
of the Kathbone Sisters, and in extending this
welcome to you 1 am glad to Bar that Kings
County, conscious of woman's rights, at the
recant election roiled up 300 majority ior
equal suffrage.
The grand chancellor responded Driefly,
saying that the exhibition of good will
and hospitality by the city had been un
tqualed.
The session of the lodge was then re
sumed with tbe reading of the report of
the grand chancellor. It congratulated
tne order upon its increased strength of
members. Despite tbe pressure of hard
times some -'20 new members have been
added to tbe loilj during 1896, making a
total at present of 10,772, the highest
number reached in twenty-eignt years. It
spoke highly of the Sacramento board ol
relief, and it suggested the lowering of
the age limit so as to admit young men ol
18 years, a move which would enlist en
thusiastic young blood wnich would hold
to Pythianisru as its first love in fraternal
ortiert. T c report instanced graphically
the scope of the order's good work in the
following words:
"Once a knight always a knight" has been
practically illustrated in many instances dur
ing the Dast year. Mars Lodge No. 20:2 es
poused the cause of brother Frank Tucker,
member of an Eastern lodge, who was under
sentence of two years' imprisonment at hard
labor in Aleatraz. At first it seemed as if nis
only recommendation was tliat be was a
Kmght of Pythias, but upon examiuiiig into
the facts be was granted a pardon after a
brief lour months' incarceration.
Colton Lodge No. 137 finds one oi its mem
bers lying in a bou in American jail, charged
with murder but unable to secure a hearing.
Through the grand and supreme chancellors,
the authorities at Washington are reached
and the entire machinery of tbe American
Government is in active motion endeavoring
to secure for him a fair trial and an oppor
tunity 10 vindicate himself.
Another lodge discovers a former member
serving a life sentence at Folsom for a crime
of which he protests he knows nothiue. A '
thorough, systematic investigation is set on
foot, and, if the facts warrant, steps will be
taken to secure his release.
Ours is a law-abiding, crime-detesting, in
tensely loyal order, but it is great enough,
broad enough, liberal enough, and it has
sufficient strength and influence to protect in
nocent men in every peril, to iollow worthy
men when unjustly accused to dungeon cells,
or, if need be, to the gallows itself. We hope
the lime has come when every American citi
zen who clings to tne Stars and Stripes for
protection will secure his just rights in any
foreign land, but we are inexpressibly proud
to know that Py thianism protects its mem
bers wherever the sun shines.
Pluio Lodge No. 130 has knowledge that a
member of an Eastern lodge Is in destitute
circumstances and sorely afflicted by an al
most fatal illness. Uisown lodge is in finan
cial straits and cannot aid him. Pluto Lodge
obtains a dispensation, appeals to her sister
California lodges and gives the brother the
most skillful medical care and attendance of
one of the bust hosplmls in Sau Francisco
Summit Lodge No. 54 knows that a long
suspended member is in want and dying from
rheumatism. It enlists the Masons and Odd
Fellows in his behalf, for he was formerly an
honored member of both, and the three or
ders send him away to medical springs, where
he is cured.
Ban Jose No. 25 has a moit deserving past
chancellor who lose* a leg. Alter helping him
to the extent of their power they obtain a dis
pensation to appeal to me lodges or tho State
for help to procure foi him an artificial limb
that he may be able to support himself and
those depending upon him.
Redlauds Lodge No. 180 is aware that a de
serving knight has become permanently
blind. The afflicted brother belongs to an
other domain, but has lived in Redlands long
enough to demonstrate that he is a noble
beirted Pythian. The lodge decides to pro
vide a home for the destitute man and his
family. A peution is circulated among the
lodges, asking them each to assist slightly,
but Kedlands No. 186 bears the brunt of the
burden and does it cheerfully and generously.

It ID DA Via LEAVE A WILL?
Sensational Story Told by a A#tc Jersey
Contie:
BUTTE, Most., May 18.â A stir was
created to-day among the heirs of the
Davis estate by the receipt of a letter from
the American Tract Society of New I'ork
inclosing another from Edwin Stoddard,
an inmate of the Trenton (N. J.) peniten
tiary.
Stoddard says he has positive knowl
edge of the existence of a will of the late
A- J. Davis by which the American Tract
Society , the American Bible Society and
the American Board of Foreign Missions
were each to receive $10,000, and by which
$500,000 is set aside for the University of
Butte.
Stoddard's knowledge, he says, comes
from the fact that he had the will in his
possession tor a lone; time for the purpose
of forging another will at the Instance of
certain persons. The scheme of forgery
was not completed when he was sent to
the penitentiary, and he only recently
learned that the original will had not
been probated.

Democrats and ttitrtr Republican* at
Loggerheads.
L.OS ANGELES, Cal., May 18â Local
Democrats and Silver Republicans are
having a pretty row over the question of
ownership of W. J. Bryan, who will be
here on July 5. The Silver Republicans
claim that he belongs more to them and
they propose to appropriate him bodily
on his arrival, give for him a banquet of
3000 plates and in other ways shower at
tentions upen their chief. The old-line
Democrats da not want it that way. They
claim that Bryan belongs to them and his
effulgence is for them alone. They have
started a movement to raise a large stun
of money, pay Bryan for his lecture, hire
the fiesta tribunes for him and give every
body a chance to hear or see him free. .
The rivalry between the Democrats and
the Free Silver Republicans is so warm
now that it may cause a serious fracture
in their heretofore close relationship.

CHICAGO, 111, May 18.â Ex-Governor
Altgeld has spent the last six days in the
seclusion of the Sacred Heart Sanitarium,
Milwaukee, in a serious nervous condition.
The sanitarium authorities say that the
ex-Governor did not take the regular
Kneipp treatment; all be did was to walk
barefooted in the wet grass during the
aariy morning hours and take a few baths
daily. Every effort was made to keep his
sojourn quiet, as he had decided to have
perfect rest.
The ex-Governor and wife returned to
Chicago last evening. Altgeld retired im
mediately and no formal announcement
of his condition was made, though the at
tendants at the hotel said he was ill. It
is generally known among his friends
that Altgeld has been suffering from
nervous prostration and locomotor ataxia.
There is little doubt that the ex-Gov
ernor is worried greatly over Spalding's
defalcation. Aside from his financial
troubles, which are many, ex-Governor
Altgeld has found himself entangled in
the Dreyer embezzlement to the extent
that he had secured the appointment of
Dreyer as treasurer of the West Park
Board and had borrowed money of him.

THE YOUNGEST SOLDIER.
William C. Shute Presents the
Record to Prove His l - â¢
â â  Title, : 'â *"''â '.:.';;â ..,:
He Was Wounitd in Battle When
Fifteen Years Old, Mastered 1 ;
Out at Sixteen.'
William C. Sbute properly salutes the
flag and steps to the front, asserting that
be is the youngest soldier of the Union
army in the Civil War now residing on
the Pacific Coast. He quotes the record
of George E. Bayless, who was born on
August 11, 1849, and enlisted February 26,
1864, as a member of- Company B, Thir
teenth Ohio Cavalry, and was discharged
at the close of the war, just before he-was
16 years eld. In comparison with. . Bay
less' record Mr. Shute presents his own in
this language: ... ( Â; . .. . Â j
I, William C... Shute, Company A. Four
teenth Maine Volunteers, First Brigade, Sec
ond Division, Nineteenth Army Corps, born
in Prospect, Waldo County, Maine, August
29, 1849; left school in Bangor, Me., went to
Augusta and enlisted in tbei^urteeuth Maine
Volunteers January 14", 1864; was mustered
out of the United States' service â  August 28,
1865, one day before I was IB years of age. I
was wounded at Winchester September 19,
1864, under Sheridan.' Our brigade made the
lust long march from Savannah to 'Augusta,
Ga., and my company (A) took charge of
Jeff Davis and wife, Alex Stephens and oth
ers and took them to Fortress Monroe on the
steamer William P. Clyde. 'â  '. '
I joined Lincoln Post No. 1, G. A. R., here in
San Francisco in 1884, and had the honor of
carrying the flag in me Second Division the
night of the grand turnout for James G.

ployed there in Pope & Talbot's towboais
about -six years and have been away from Shu
Francisco about twelve year*. lam now mate
of the steamer Czarina In J. D. Sprockets' em
ploy. . ...
Mr. George K. Bayless says he does not
claim the title of being the youngest soldier,
but until another infantile patriot pops up
with ample proof he will claim the distinction
of being the youngest soldier on the Pacific
Coast and in San Francisco in particular.
Well, this infantile now pops up with ample
proof, If the article in the paperâ the Satur
day Blade of Chicago, May Iâ is correct, Mr.
Bayless is eighteen days -older than I and
joined the army one month and twelve days
later and was discharged eighteen days before
I was mustered out. Now let the lnfantiles
pop away and if any can go one better 1 will
say no more. This contioversy does not in
clude drummers or buglers, but refers to the
I youngest soldier that carried 1 a Springfield
rifle. William C. Shite,

BAKER WAS EASY
FOR JEFFRIES
The Los , Angeles Heavy
Weight Wins in Nine
Rounds. .
â -â¢â â â â  . "-
Leonard Was in Very Poor
Condition, but Lasted the
1 Limit.'
A B g Crowd Saw the Olympic Club
Entertainmentâ Lawler Beat
Riiliy.
Fifteen hundred ringsters crowded into
Woodward's Pavilion to see the boxing
entertainment of the Olympic Club last
evening and sweltered through three more
or less interesting bouts. :^ â¢
Two of the six participants were in no
ticeably Dad condition, Mike Leonard be
ing so fat that the hard fight with Joe
Gans trained him down at least five
pounds during the twenty rounds.
Henry Baker, the Chicago heavyweight,
who was scheduled to go twenty rounds
with Jeffries, the Los Angeles giant, had
rolls of fat hanging over his belt as he sat
in his corner, and he had bellows to mend
before the fight had been in progress fif
teen minutes.
It is this matter of allowing pugilists to
enter the ring in bad condition that puts
boxing in bad repute. ' Every little while
some pugilist is killed as a result of un
dertraining, and then a cry goes up
against the brutality of the spore.
. Both Leonard and Baker looked as
though they bad trained on steam beer,
and their actions in the ring bore out the
supposition that \ they had. It was
rumored before the gong sounded for the
first bout that' the Leonard-Gans battle
was off, because the former could not
weigh in at the limit of 133 pounds, but
both appeared, and it. was announced that
Leonard was ill and bad refused to weigh
in and had forfeited his $100 deposit to
Gans. '
The colored lad was willing to fight at
any weight, and the referee announced
that the fight would go on, but that all
bets were oil.
. Jim Iteilly and Jim Lawler, two willing
local lads, who weighed in at 123 pounds
each, put up a hard-hitting battle of ten
rounds, Lawler's straight left leads and
generally clever work winning him tne
decision of Referee Phil Wand.
Gans in nis twenty-round go with
Leonard took a strong lead from the j
start and chased the fat dude of the ring I
persistently. Leonard got weak after a
few rounds and danced about and
clinched to avoid punishment. â  Occa
sionally be would back up against the
ropes and, using them Â°b a spring against
his bacK, lunge at Gans as the Balti
rnorean came at him, but be inflicted no
punishment after the tenth round.
< .an-, apparently did not like Leonard's
style, for he kept away whenever the Beau
Brummel. of tne pugilistic fraternity
made a stand against the ropes. His cau
tious leads and occasional scoring won
him the decision, though it was apparent
he was almost as weak, as his opponent
when the gong sounded in the final. Gans
was a 1 disappointment to those who saw.
him knock Charley.' Rochette out several
months asro. Â»
â¢ Much interest was manifested when the
heavy-weights made their appearance.
Henry Bake', the fat boy of Chicago,
came first. He looked liKe a New York
Alderman; layers of fat hung over his
waistband.
Jeffries was trained to a turn. He
looked a magnificent specimen of the
athlete. In fact, his opponent, whan they
mood face to face, appeared as if he had
been put into the ring to fill up a gap.
Baker scaled 175 pounds and Jeffries
tipped the beam at 201 pounds, which is
rune pounds lower than he has ever
fought. Baker looked like a pigmy along
side of the California champion.
Baker proved right away that he was a
clever man on his feet. After considera
ble fiddling Baker shot out his left, which
landed lightly on "Jeff's" mouth. The
latter returned the compliment and then
missed Baker's face with a right swing
which, had it landed, would have done
damage. â¢ â¢ - â¢â >-..
'Jeffries went bang against the ropes.
Considerable clinching was indulged in
and as the round closed Baker landed a
left and right on Jeffries' mouth.
In the second round Jeffries caught a
hard right-hand punch in the left eye
which left its imprint. Jeffries ducked
cleverly from several swings and in the
clinches which followed he was hissed by
the gallery â¢ because he struck â¢at Baker
when both men had one hand free, which
was perfectly proper and according to rule.
In the third round Jeffries played for
Baker's stomach, but the Chicago man
backed away and danced around the ring
with the big fellow in hot pursuit. Both
men landed, but the blows were not very
effective. I \ â  . .
In the fourth round Jeffries sent Baker
under the ropes with a body ' blow, but
near the end of the round Baker landed a
hard right on Jeffries' mouth. â 
After this round, and until the ninth
round, Jeffrie!" scored a strong lead. In
the eighth Jeffries knocked Baker down
with a lett on the jaw and then ham
mered him all over top ring, but failed to
score a knockout. Baker went down
twice.
In the ninth round Baker received a
lefthand smash on the jaw that sent him
sprawling over the ropes, and "Spider"
Kelly, his second, threw up the sponge.

Religious Service for Lepers-
The lepers at the Pesthouse have been
pretty generally neglected by relicious work
ers. For one thing, there are few whites
among the patients, and the Cbineso are very
indifferent to all religious matters, and for an
other, religions workers are afraid to face the
leprosy.
| Yesterday General F. L. yon Lladman of the
American Gospel Army, visited the Pesthouse
with a view to seeing what could betloneby
his orgunizatlon to better the condition of the
unfortunates. As the army has a flourishing
Chinese branch it iÂ« probable that Brigadier
Woods, wno has charge of it, will be given the
Pesthouse as part of his charge, and v ill visit
the inmates regularly.
The lepers hayÂ« about made up tbeir minds
that there is no immediate prospect ot re
moval from their present quarters find have
gone co work to improve and beautify their
rooms and the grounds by all means in their
power. The garden has been dug up and tne
neglected flowers brought into better order,
while pictures and illustrated papers have
gone.up in the rooms.

The Columbian Branch Based Upon
Stricter Party .Lines.
Another branch of the Socialist Labor

has been formed in this City. The princi
pal promoters are G. B. Benham. R. T. ,

! new branch will begin holdinz Sunday
I morning meetings, beginning on the first
j Sunday in June, in Pythian Castle, on
I Market street, near Fif th. The promot-
I crs believe that there in a field for the new
organization and there is no feeling of
jealousy or rivalry in the movement.
However, it will hold more strictly to
the platform of the Socialist Labor party
than the other branches and not be de
voted to side lines. For example it favors
trade unions. While not believing that
trades unionism is the solution of the
economic question, still they believe
unionism on those lines is a step in the
rfght direction. Moreover, it is favored in
the party platform.

DISCUSSED POINTS
OF DOCTRINE
Rev. R. Ritchie Contrasts
Anglican and Latin
" Purity."
First Session of the Episcopal
Convention Opens at St.
Luke's.
Bishop N:c! o'.s Presides at tne Bmi
n ss S sson â Satisfactory
R por s R ad.
A burning question to Episcopal theo
logians was discussed by Rev. Robert
Ritchie, in his sermon at the opening of
the forty- seventh annual Episcopal con
vention at BL Luke'i Church yesterday
noroiÃg.
The recent encyclical of the Archbishops
of Canterbury ana York was the subject
which inspired Mr. Ritchie's remarks.
This encyclical of the Anglican divines has
be?n issued in answer to the encyclical pro
mulgated some months ago by Pope Leo
XIII, denying the validity of Anglican
orders.
Mr. Ritchie began his sermon by express
ing his belief thai the Anglican church
had no need to blush for its position in
the matter. Continuing he said:
The spirit of cam reliance upon tne impreg-
BISHOP NICHOLS Opening the Diocesan Convention.
nable nature of their position breathed In
every line of the Archbishors' letter, and the
confidence with which they appeal to their
brother Bishops of the catholic church for a
just verdict nre very impressive.
Anotoer poiut, besides the validity of our
orders on wnich we differ from the Laun
church is the question of sanctity. The charge
o: un<anctitv has b*en put up against us. In
the Roman Catholic church the best expres
sion of sanctity is supposed to lie in asceti
cism. It divides Christians into two classesâ
those fitted to reaj. and plow and bear chil
dren. Thesp are not the higher class. No; the
highest nre those set appart tor asceticism,
for sanciily in the Roman conception is the
ame as asceticism.
Judged by this standard, you must acknowl
edge that our own church falls short. She is
not rich in ascetic saints. I do not believe
this sort of seed is fit for Anglo-Saxon soil.
The preacher continued by stating that
he could hnd no worci in the Gospels from j
first to last that commends asceticism. |
He continu d:
W.iat, then, is the Anglo-Saxon type of holi- I
ness? Oar conception of Christianity is ibe !
natural lifÂ», sweetened and sanctified by re- j
ligton, and in thai is found email room for the I
emotionalism of the Latin, or the senti- !
mentalism of the Celt. The highest type of i
sanctity it that which can live in the world :
and keep the heart pure as a temple 01 God. '
That kind of saint can bear pn.n manfully !
when it comes, but he never manufactures it.
Tnank God that kind of saint is too common
to need boaiting about.
At the conclusion of the mornin.- !
prayer and sermon holy communion waÂ«
celebrated, the Right llev. Biahop Nichols
being the celebrant.
In accordance with an amendment in
the constitution made last year, the busi
ness sessions of the convention will take

businets session was called to order yes

Hokkelen, showed a surplus in every fund

THE EVENING SESSION.
Professor Bailey Lays Strsss on
the "Intellect" Obstacle.
The evening session of thÂ« convention
was devoted to the discussion of three
subjects: "The Daughters ot the King,"
by Rev. T. J. Lacy of Christ Church, Ala
meda; "Tfte Brotherhood of 8t Andrew,"
by Professor A. W. Bailey of 8u MarkN
Chnrch, Berkeley," and '-The Good of the
Church as a Whole," by Bishop Nichols.
Rev. D. O. Kelly, acting chaplain of the
Presidio, opened the service with prayer,
Rev. Dr. Edward Walk of Trinity Church
read the lessons and Rev. F. J. Mynard of
Bt. John's Church. Oakland, read the
prayers for the evening. The choir ren
dered interludes.
Rev. Mr. Lacy began his theme by
speaking of the origin and growth of the
organization called the Daughters of the
King. He believes Kansas to be their
stronghold from a numerical standpoint.
He explained that the order was called
Daughters of the King and not King's
Daughters, because the former term bad
always a spiritual meanine, as used by
the psalmist, David, while the latter fre
quently referred to Princesses marcning in
triumphal processions. The distinction
he stated, was a fruitful source of query
ing.
The speaker dwelt at length on the in
tense spirituality manifested by the mem
bers of the order as a whole. Their first
rule was t-iven as a rule of prayer.
In treating on the subject of the Broth
erhood of St. Andrew Professor Bailey
â aid he had just finished bis first year's
work in the organization and knew the
difficulties it had to encounter. But, all
in all, he believed there was more encour
agement met with there in proportion to
dp work than nearly anywhere else.
"One of the greatest dangers of Chris
tian work," be stated, "is that often those
who are laboring for Christ do not know

him th mselvei. This Keeps a lot of use
less timber in the church who need con
stant coaxing to keep them at work.
"It requires courage to taKe the vows of
the Brotherhood of St. Andrew and the
Daughters of the King. The members
must work and pray, and if they go off
for a summer holiday take their religion
along.
"In Berkeley we're thrown much into
the society of university people and have
to deal with toe problem cf intellect. I
never saw such a state in my life where so
many people have a respect for religion
and yet do not profess it. The members
of these two orders should be students, so
as to meet this intellect problem."
"Words for the brothers, words for the
daughters," began Bishop Nichols, "and
now a word for the wbole family."
Taking as the basis of his theme the
parable in which comparisons were made
to the kingdom of heaven, he drew at
tention to the facts that t!ie woman took
tne leaven and the man the mustard seed,
and that the woman needed the leaven
for bread and man the mustard seed for
the result of its growth.
The burden of his remarks were to the
effect that if people would only take the
means of amelioration offered by Christ
and not try to make them, there would
be an end of the dismal failuros that mark
historical epochs. If tnese things were
borne in mind, he asserted in conclusion
the gospel would be speeded on its mis
sion of "Peace on earth, good will toward
men."
Prior to the benediction by the Bishop
Rev. Mr. Riley of St. Paul's drew atten
tion t<> the !ac that the general annual
meeting of the Woman's Auxiliary will be
he'd at that church, beginning next Fri
day morning at 9 o'clock. Bishop Nichols
will celebrate the communion service and
Rev. Mr. Mills of Sacramento will preach
the sermon.
RANGES BY THE CALL TOWER.
Lieutenant E. D. Tausaig Tellg How
Marine Fact* Will Be Gathered.
Lieutenant-Commander E. D. Taussig,
U. S. N., Hydrostatic Inspector of the
Coast and Geodetic Survey, with head
quarters at Washington, D. C, is at the
Occidental. He left Washington early in
April, and has since been on Pueret Sound
and in Oregon. He says he is making his
annual trip, somewhat in connection with
routine busiuess, but is especially looking
up matters in regard to Coast and Geo
detic Survey vessel?. In reference to the
s-tiine of marine compasses hereabout by
The Call building and the ferry tower, he
said that the project was entirely prac
ticable an<i feasible.
"In the March notices to mariners," he
continued, "the attention of the mariners
was called to the gathering of informn
lion as to desirable ranges which wouid
be of assistance to mariners in connection
with their compasses or in hmiinp the de
viations of theircompasses. The officer's of
the coast survey s earner McAnhur have
lately been examining the suitable ranges
abont tie Pan Francisco harbor, and the
results will nrobablr soon be published."
Lieutenant-Commander Taussig will
probably leave on his return to Washing
ton this evening or to-morrow.

Bad Aecirttnt to S. M. Ewlng.
An ugly accideut occurred to Samuel M.
Ewlag, the proficient and popular newspaper
man, on April 25 which ii just becoming
known among his friends, who have miÂ«sed
him and wondered the reason for his seel U9 ion.
On that day he wns stepping from au Oakland
cÂ«r when his right foot caught by the heel in a
depression in the asphaltum. He was thrown
forward and the ankle was seriously fractured.
He has since been under the care of the sur
econ. The foot has been treated and put In a
plaster cast, and it will probably be Â».i late as
June 10 beiore the cast can come off. He is
confined to his home at 2907 Bush street.

PROMINENT OFFICERS OF THE RETAIL GROCERS' ASSOCIATION.
The transporting facilities of the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad Company will be taxed to their utmost capacity to-day in
conveying those who will attend the twenty-sixth annual picnic of the retail grocers of this City to Bchuetzen Park.
Erery grocer with his family, and every family who deals with the obliglug man at the corner, will don summer fabric this morning
before locking up stores and bouses and starting for Schuetzen Park. John C. Nohmann, president, and E. J. Fleiger secretary, of the
Retail Grocers' Association, were as busy yesterday as the King of Greece and his Prime Minister in making final arrangements for to-day's
outing. Even Honest John Liciman withdrew his cares irom the City Hall and dnvoted the entire day to picnic affairs.
D. Becker hud barely time to adjust his whiskers, so busy was he with to-day's arrangements. Joseph Stulx drew his check on the
bank lor sufficient twenties 10 set the machinery in motion. J. J. Hayes left off his turned-down colliir ana went to the association's head
quarters, volunteering his service. D. A. Schmidt and John Schloen vied with <-Â«eh other as to which could get the most requisite material
into their lunch-baskets for their friends, j. J. Moran refused to impart Â«ny information ai to the number he hud invited.
J. H. Harrje and J. Â£. A. Helm* have made a friendly bei that the first at ihe ferry-boat shall cartv both lunch-baskets from the train
to the park. Eide H. Hanjcs has promised his pretty wile and babies a day's amusement not to be forgotten during the remainder of this
century, and, in brief, every person who visits Schnetzen Park will be delighted with the result.
Captain Fred Sc.umann, proprietor of the park, was ai the headquarters of the society in this City yesterday, and informed the
committee that the grounds were in nnt-class condition,

RETRENCHMENT.
A Cut in Salaries Made All Along the
lime in the Treasury De
partment.
Federal officials were flurried when De
Witt C. Jackson, special agent of the
treasury, informed them that he had re
ceived a letter from the Secretary of the
Treasury notifying him that his services
would be dispensed with in the interest
of economy and reform. At the same
time the salary of Chinese inspectors was
cut from $6 to $4 per day. It appears that
customs in-pec ors detailed to act as
heads of the Chinese bureau received only
$4 per day, while their subordinates re
ceived ?6 This was an absurdity on its
face, and the salaries have been made
uniform.
Similar cuts and removals are being
made all over the United States in the in
teres; of retrenchment.

LOST HER REASON.
Selina Kleiston, Deserted In Stockton,
Is Now in an Asylum.
Chief Lees was notified from Stockton
yesterday to lind out, if possible, the
friend* of Selina Kleiston, a yonng
woman 24 years of age.
She left this City last Sunday by the
steamer for Stockton, accompanied by a
young man to whom, it is supposed, she
was engaged to be married. On their ar
rival in Stockton the young man deserted
her, and grief made her lose her reason.
She has been sent to the Stockton Insane
Asylum.
She has sharp features and dark com
plexion. She is a German and can talk
very little English.
Fitzgerald Did Not Appear.
Shortly after the arrival of Labor Commis
sioner E. L. Fitzgerald from the Sandwich
Islands he sent word to J. W. Rose, chairman
of the California Labor Convention, that if he
would call a meeting of the convention a re
port of tin.- labor situation at tne islands
wouM be presented hy the Labor Commis
sioner. Rose issued a call for the delegates to
meet last evening at !Mr>' a Market, street, and
so notified Mr. Fitzgerald. A number of dele
gates responded to the call, but the Labor
Commissioner did not put in an appearance,
and the meeting was adjourned to Sunday at
2 F. M.
CITY OWNERSHIP
OF WATER WORKS
Debate in B'nai B'rith Hall
Won by the Affirma
tive.
Comparison of the System With
That of Glasgow and
Other Cities.
Literary and Musical F ast by the
Committee on Intellectual Im
provement.
Last night in B'nai B'rith Hall took
place the first of this year's series of lit
erary and musical entertainments given
by the committee on intellectual im
provement and the Past Presidents' Asso
ciation of District No. 4, I. 0. B. B.
Edward Tauszky, chairman of the com
mittee on intellectual improvement,
opened the entertainment with a brief ad
dresv, calling attention to the excellent
and varied programme and welcoming
the large audience.
Lucius L. Solomon*, erand orator. Dis
trict No. 4, I. 0. B. 8., followed. He said
that whatever might be said or thought of
its organizationâ good, bad or indifferent â
it was zratifying to behold such an
audience gathered together on a Jewish
occasion and under the auspices of a Jew
ish order. They were bound together by
the tie* of creed and biood, which obli
gation was manifold.
The literary feature of the evening was
a debate on the question :
Resolved, That the City should own and con
rol its water supply.
The speakers for the affirmative were H
Gutstadt and Hugo K. Asher. For the
negative were I. I. Brown and Edgar D.
Peixotto.
Mr. Asher began the debate for tbe
affirmative. He said in substance:
Supplying water to a large municipality lÂ»,
more than any other bu.sinesÃ, likely to result
in a monopoly, which is chiefly due to the
fact thai a very large expenditure of money is
requisite for the purpose of carrying on that
bu-iness, and but very few people have the
means to engage in it, and the few who have
the capital do not care to run the risk of loss
by reaton of competition. The Spring Valley
Company has, in addition to its business of
supplying water, taken care so to conduct its
operations as to keep out any competition.
This it has done by buying up every available
supply of water which might be easily brought
into the peninsula.
If the City desired to own its water works
it would be able to borrow the money for 3
per cent per annum with which to purchase
the works, and it would be enabled to cut
down the cost o f water to about half of what
It is now. In 1886 the City paid for water for
municipal purpuses, such as sprinkling streets
and park*, extinguishing fires aud flushing
sewers, $70,072 73. In 1896 this sum had
swollen to $200,712 78. That makes about
80 cents for cverv man, woman and child of
the population. The City expends for hydrants
$166,000 per year.
Glasgow, Manchester, Berlin, Paris, New
York, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Buffalo and
other cities own and control their own water
supply.
Mr. Brown, for the negative, called at
tention to the fact that San .Francisco's
supr>ly lay within forty or fifty miles,
whereas the proposed supply from Lntp
Tahoe or the Blue Lakes is from 300 to 350
miles. He said:
It will cost the City not less than $25,000,
--000 or $30,000,000 to bring water irom there.
The plant of the Spring Valley Water Works
could not be condemned by the City under the
exerciso of the law of eminent domain, be
cause there was no l*w to permit the robDery
of the property of the company. Money
could not be had for less than 4VÂ£ per cent and
that rate on $25,000,000 would be $1,125,000
per annum plus a sinking lvm 1 oi $625,000
per annum. Add to this the operating ex
penses of the works ($376,000 per annum) and
it would be found that the City could not af
ford to take water from the Blue Lakes or
Lake Tahoe.
Mr. Gutstadt followed for the affirma
tive. With reference to the contention
of Mr. Brown that it would not be
feasible for the City to put in its own
water- works because of the great expense
it would involve, he said that engineers
had estimated that for $15,000,000 the City
could get an ample supply and could
place her bonds for that amount at 3 per
cent. He cited the water rates in Glas
gow, where the water was taken from a
source thirty-four miles distant, as being
only 40 cents per month for a house rent
ing at $25 per month.
Mr. Peixotto closed for the negative in a
humorous vein.
The ju Iges. M. P. Stein, Jacob Greene
baum, William Baalbertr, Frank Sparling
and Henry Schwartz decided that the
affirmative argument was the better one.
The concert was of a high class and
very enjoyable. The Hungarian orches
tra played selections from "Orpheus,"
"Carmen," "El Capitan" and the inter
mezzo from "Cavalleria Rusticana."
Sipnor Abramoff san^ a selection from
"Nebuchadnezzar," and Miss Mary Gib
bons sang Centemeri's "Deep in my
Heart." Both were enthusiastically en
cured. A mandolin orchestra completed
the musical treat.

Turkey takes a second thought and hesi

Edhem Pasha is now prepared to give
his opinion on "Called Back."
Congress talks of Cuba, but continues to
make plans for the tariff fight.
The Czar is said to have shown his hand
and the great diplomatic poser game is

Ii Eenator Wellington wishes to know

The money-lenders of Europe will now
begin to take stock in Greece to the extent
of her war debt.
By the time the Senate gets through
â with the tariff bill the Finance Committee
will wonder why it took the trouble to re-
Vise it.
Bailey's latest parliamentary stroke
may be fun for the Democrats, but it was
death on American citizens who are desti
tute in Cuba.
Unless ihe Senate hastens with the
tariff there will be so many foreign goods
imported into the country that protection
won't have a chance to take effect for a
year to come.
The submarine boat is a little ahead of
the airship in approaching the stage of
practical use, and we may be crossing the
ocean under the waves before we make the
trip above the storms.
If we can get the best features of the
Dingley bill united to the best features of
the Senate bill everything will be peace
ful, but it will take a hard fight and a
lons one to attain the peace.
In order to keep up appearances as arbi
ter of Europe and keeper of the peace, the
Kai9er will soon have to make a change
of front of some kind, and we may hear
any day that he has a new uniform.
The public debt of Turkey amounts to
about $?00,000,000; but the Turk has no
reason to regret the fact, for in the great
ness of his indebtedness he finds assur
ance of support from the stocK exchanges
of ail Europe.
There are men who argue we shall never
have good times until the bankruptcy bill
becomes a law, as it is necessary to clean
off the debts of the Democratic depression
before business enterprise can make a new
Btart for prosperity.
The Turks are acting in Greece like
naughty boys at a picnic who are having
a good time, and do not intend to go home
if they can help it. Old Dame Europe
may have to spanK them yet in order to
make them behave themselves.
The speeches delivered by McKinley at
the dedication of the Grant mausoleum
and the unveiling of the monument to
"Washington were models of their kind,
and show in every sentence that modera
tion of language which is an evidence of
strength of thought.
It would be better for Creelman to con
fine his energies to faking interviews with
the Emperor of China, the Pope and other
foreign dignitaries, for whenever he tries
his fake on a Congressman he a' ways sets
branded as a liar inside of twenty-four
hours.
Once more the Senate is face to face
with the question whether under the con
stitution the power of recognizing a
foreign country is vested exclusively in
ihe President, and once more it inclines
tv put the issue by and leave it for future
generations to debate upon.
It is said that by the terms of his agree
ment with the powers at the time he ac
cepted the throne of Greece King Georga,
if deposed, is to have $120,000 a year, but
if lie abdicates his pension will be only
$40,000. If the King ever goes out, there
fore, it will not be b7 abdication.
The absorption of Brooklyn into New
York will raise Boston from the sixth to
the filth city in the United States In point
of population, and the psople of the Hub
are watching the performance with so
much attention they are liable to be ab
sorbed themselves before they know it.
The argument of Senator Wellington
that the recognition of the belligerent
rights of the Cubans would mean a war
with Spain may pass in the Senate, but it
ta not up to the usual debating society
standards. It is always possible to recog
nize the existence of one war without
starting another.
There is nothing in the Chapman case
at Washington to encourage the hope
that we shall ever get at the truth of the
sugar deal of the Wilson tariff. A thirty
days' confinement in a well-furnished
apartment, with good cigars and tine din
ners sent in from a swell restaurant, is not
the kind of prison life that squeezes the
truth out of an unwilling witness. The
imprisonment of Chapman will b* nimply
an advertisement of his trade, and when
he returns to New York he will have more
clients and do a bigger business th.uu evert
THE TARIFF.
While the Cuban qnestion occupies the
chief part of the public dpbates in Con
gress, information from Washington as
sures us that the Senators are less con
cerned about Cuba than they are about
the schedules and rates of the new tariff.
Keports of dickering and log-roiling of all
kinds are heard everywhere, and some of
these so seriously concern Californian in
terests as to merit earnest consideration
here.
According to one report, several West
ern Senators have been informed by
friends of the sugar schedule in the Sen
ate bill that Western interests will bo
attacked unless they vote for that sched
ule. It is said by one authority that CaJi
f rnians have been offered a restoration of
the Hawaiian reciprocity clause of the
Dingley bill in exchange for their support
of the sugar duties fixed by the Finance
Committee. Another authority says the
California Senators have been informed
that strong opposition will be made to the
duties on citrus fruits and Zante currants,
the inference being that if Californians
desire to mainta n those duties they must
be ready to accept either the sugar sched
ule or some other point on which Eastern
sentiment is united.
The interests of California are so divided
between the Dingley bill and the Senate
bill that it is hard to determine which
will bB most likely to promote our welfare.
Under the Dingley bill we get better pro
tection for prunes, raisins and other dried
fruits and wines than we do under the
Senate bill. On the other hand, the Sen
ate bill gives us better protection for citrus
fruits, wool, hides and lead. If we had
to choose between one bill or the other,
the choice would be difficult. Fortunately
that alternative is not imposed on us.
There is a possibility we may ealn the
best features of both bills, and to attain
that every energy should now be directed.
The claims of the West in this discus
sion are so well founded it is difficult to
see how they can be objected to by any
one who stands firmly upon the protec
tive system as a general principle. Pro
tection can never be made perfect until it
is made so National as to benefit every
section of the country equally and so uni
versal as to benefit all classes of industry.
Tbe Eastern claim for free hides and free
low-grade wools, with low duties on fruits
and wines, is certainly not in harmony
with the general principle of protection to
American industry. The West asks for no
sacrifice of any Eastern interest and is,
therefore, in a good position to ask thor
ough protection to all of its own.
The danger in the situation lies in the
fact that tbe Senate is not under the con
trol of a thorough nrotectionist majority.
No bill can pass in that body which is not
to some extent a compromise measure.
As a natural result there will ba a great
deal of dickering and log-rolling in mak
ing up the new tariff. This constitutes a
menace to California, and to the West
generally, and we must be on our guard
to protect our interests, for otherwise tney
will be sacrificed in the contest.
JUDGE MORROW.
The appointment of Judge Morrow to
fill the vacancy in the United States Cir
cuit Court caused by the retirement of
Judge McKenna is not a surprise to the
people of California, inasmuch a- it
was confidently predicted by our
Washington correspondent three weeks
ago, but is none the less gratify
ing. While the appointment was ex
pected, it is pleasant to have it made so
as to have an end to all uncertainty. The
President has once more shown the excel
lence of his judgment in the selection of
men to fill high positions by the choice of
one who is so well fitted for the office that
the appointment will be greeted with ap
proval by men of all parties.
The Hon. William W. Morrow came
to this coast while yet a boy and has
been identified with it since the far
off times before the war. He has served
the people of California in many ways
and always with fidelity and distinction.
His legal learning has given him rank
with the foremost jurists of the country,
his career in Congress attested his devo
tion to the public welfare and his sagacity
as a legislator, while his record since he
has been on the bench is one which has
confirmed public confidence in his judicial
impartiality and his conscientious regard
for the rights and interests of every liti
gant who comes before him.
The appointment of JuJge Morrow is in
the fullest sense a response to the ex
pressed wishes of the people of California.
His selection was urged upon the Presi
dent by the CaJifornia delegation in
Congress, by the Bar Association of San
Francisco, by the Chamber of Commerce,
and by every Influential organization or
body of citizens among us. He enters
upon his oi'ice therefore as the choice of
his fellow-citizens as well as of the Prssi
dent, and has the satisfaction of knowing
that the popular appreciation of his past
services is the basis on which rests public
confidence in his ability to fill with honor
to himself and with benefit to his coun
trymen the higher office to which he has
now been called.
THE JINGOES.
In the debate on the Morgan resolution,
recognizing the belligerency of the Cuban
patriots, Senator Wellington, who opposed
the resolution, was so severe in his attack
upon what he called the jingoes of the
country that Senator Pettus of Alabama
was constrained to ask him, "Who are the
jingoes and what are the jingoes?" To
this question Senator Wellington replied:
"Jingoism is the spirit that would drag
our country into war with Spain: it is the
spirit that would draw us into controversy
witti every country in Europe and make
more enemies than friends."
Since the word jingo is slang and has
no well-defined meaning the right of Sen
ator Wellington to give it such, definition
as he chooses cannot be disputed. When,
however, he defines it as one who desires
to involve this country in war with Spain
or with any other nation he is not justi
fied in applying the term to tbosa who
believe it to be the duty of this country to
recognize the belligerent rights of the
Cuban patriots, nor even to those who go
further and desire the Government to rec
ognize the indepenaance oi the Cuban re
public. Neither of these actions on our
part would do snch wrong to Spain as to
justify her in declaring a war against us,
nor are those who advocate them in any
way desirous of beginning such a war.
It is clear that Senator Wellington gave
his definition of jingo from nis prejudices
rather than from hi* reason. He is op
posed to men who desire to see the inde
pendence o! Cuba, and as is natural with
those who are not accustomed to intel
lectual contests, and who do not under
stand how men may honestly differ in
opinion, he leaps to the conclusion that
his opponents are rash, desperate and
wicked. He assumes that as they desire
evil ends they are willing to resort to evil
methods of attaining them.
There are two classes of people in this as
in every other progressive country. One
of these classes believes that whatever is
is right, and, therefore, insists upon
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, 31 AY 19, 1897.
maintaining the existing order. Tbe other
class believes that the law of evolution
and development has not yet ceased to
exert its fores among men, and conse
quently thai what was right yesterday
may not be right to-day. This latter
class Admits lluit Spanish government in
Cuba may have been good in times past,
but cites the existing war and struggle in
that country us n conclusive pioof that it
is no longer good either for Spain or for
lhÂ« CotMU, This class advocates freedom
and liberty In order ttiat the law of de
velopment may have room for growth.
It is to this class that the term jingo has
been applied. It must accept the name
since in our time language is free, but it
will not accept the definition given it by
hidebound conservatives of the Welline
ton type. It believes that right can be
done without war, but all the same it
would not shrink from war in the per
formance of duty if that alternative
should be imposed upon it.
CHAPMAN IN JAIL
Broker Chapman, who declined to an
swer the questions of the Senate investi
gating committee on the alleged deal of
United States Senators in sugar stocks at
the time when the present tariff was
under consideration in the Senate, is now
in prison in Washington City, under a
sentence of thirty days' confinement.
It is announced that two of the best
celis in the jail have been assigned to him,
he has furnished them nicely at his own
expense, and is served with food from the
I Arlington Hotel. He suffers no more
than he would from a detention at home
for a few days by a slight accident, and
not even so much since he has nothing
in the way of physical pain to annoy him.
There is nothing in this situation to en
courage the hope that we shall get at the
truth concerning the scandal. An im
prisonment of the kind imposed upon
Chapman will not have the slightest ten
dency to make him answer tbe questions
propounded to him. He is undoubtedly
astute enough to see that what is techni
cally called punishment is really a benefit
to him, since it will extensively advertise
his business and give assurance to his
clients that he will keep their secrets.
He will spend thirty days at reading
amusing books, smoking good cigars,
talking to pleasant friends, and then he
will go back to New York to accept a ban
quet from his admirers and resume a busi
ness which will be far more profitable than
before.
It is, in fact, a farce which is being
played out before the country under the
title of "an enforcement of the dignity of
the Senate." Resort mast be had to mach
more drastic measures than those which
have been enforced in the Chapman case
before such groat offenders as United
States Senators and managers of the sugar
trust can be brought to the bar of justice
with any chance of convicting them if
they are guilty.
The futility of the proceeding was made
evident by Senator Tillman when he
called the attention of tne Senate to the
fact that two correspondents at Washing
ton, over their signatures, have made ex
actly the same charges against Senators
in ! he revision of the new tariff as were
made in the construction of the Wilson
bill three years ago.
Senator Tillman well said that if the
Senate really means to enforce its dignity
and free itself from the aspersions upon
the honor ol its members it should deal
with the issue of to-day as well as with
that of the past. "Either act," said the
Senator, "or hush." The country in
dorses this advice, and makes the indorse
ment with the clear understanding that if
it has to choose from this alternative the
Senate will bush.
TkEN AND NOW.
In ancient days when a lover wooed
.And asked a girl to be his wife,
The maiden fair
Would mate him swear
That he would slick to her for life.
At present, when a lover wooes
And as<Â« a p-irl to share his lot,
!-he gently sighs
And then replies:
"It all depends on what you've go"."

Volunteer Firemenâ H. G., Boaie, Mono
County, Cal. Tnero is no law of California
that guarantees exemptions to honorary mem
bers of volunteer fire companies, such as are
granted to honorary members of the National
Guard. > -~
Maiden Racesâ G. A. 11., City. The term
maiden race means the first race in which an
individual participates. If a swimmer ' enters
a 100-yard race and swims that, ho would not
be eligible in aSO or 75 yard maiden race.
Being paced by a professional places the indi
vidual so paced outside of the amateur clau.
Community Propertyâ S. X., City. The best
answer that can be given to your question in
relation to community property is the follow
ing from I the code of California:
The husband has the management and control
of the community property with ih- like absolute
power of disposition (other than testamentary) as
he has of his own separate property.
Divorceâ Fannie, Bloomfield, Cal. In an ac
tion for divorce the party from whom the
divorce is sought to be obtained must be per
sonally served with a notice, If within the
jurisdiction of the court in which the action
is commenced, if the habitat of such person it
known. It not found there must be service by
mail to the last known address and publica
tion in a newspaper. Under the provisions of
the recent law parties divorced in this State
cannot marry again in this State until one
year after Uie granting of the dlvojce.
Alien Land Ownersâ m. E., Elmira, Cal.
The constitution of the State of California,
section 17. article I, redds as follows:
Foreigners of the white race or of African de
scent, eligible to become citizens of the United
states muter the naturalization laws thereof, while
bona tide residents of tuis State, shall have the
same rights In ieipect to the acquisition, posses
sion, enjoyment, transmission and inheritance of
all property other than real estate, aa native bora

estate at the time of . the a loption of this amend
ment may remain sin h owners; and provided,
further, that the Legislature may, by statute, pro
vide for : lie disposition of real estate which shall
hereafter be acquired by descent or devise.
Japanese and Chineseâ E. S., City. There
are no official statistics as to the number of
Japanese and Chinese in the United States
other than those furnished by the census of
1890. That gives the number of Japanese at
2039 In the; United States and the Chinese
107,475. Tne same authority gives the num
ber of Japanese in California us 1147 and
Chinese 75,132. Ihe Consul for Japan at this
iin<- estimates that there are from 2500 to
2800 Japanese in San Francisco during the
winter months and about 2000 during the
summer months. During the summer a por
tion of the colony goes into the country to
work on farms. It is estimated that there are
about 30,000 Chinese in San Francisco at this
time. ."
Beche de Merâ XV. E. T., City. The beche de
mer exists on the coral reefs of the Pacific and
the several species are from six to fifteen inches
in length, shaped like a cucumber, and from
their form are sometimes called sea-cucumbers.
The skin is sometimes covered with spicules
or prickles, an>l more times . are quite smooth,
with or without teats or ambulacral feet dis
posed in rows. Five varieties are recognized
in commerce. The first is the brown with
teats, and It â  worth, at the place of prepara
tion, $150 per ton; then the large black, $125
per ton; small black, $100; red-bellied, $75,
and white $60 per ton The finest sell for
$500 per . ton in China,* where they are
used in gelatinous soup, which forms an
important : article of food :in the f empire.
The preparation of the beche de mer is very
simple. They are boiled for twenty minutes,
split up and gutted and then â  they are ready
for drying. This is conducted in large sheds
on hurdles placed over a brisk fire. The dried
beche de mer are very hygrometlc,: and it Is
necessary that they be packed up ready, for
shipment on the conclusion of the drying
process. Unless they are thoroughly .. dry,
decomposition sets in rapidly and destroys the
entire package in which one decomposing one
may be.

Interest.
President Jordan's Views on State Duties.
Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: Before proceeding to make some deductions from the
views of President Jordan on State duties, expressed in his address to the Pure Food Congress,
permit me to correct an error In my former communication. I stated that "the verbal accu
racy of the reports" made by the newspapers of the words used by him "may be open to in
quiry, but the internal evidence favors the claim of inerrancy," and it appears in print f
"favors the claim of inaccuracy," a flat contradiction of what I intended to say, and knocked
my allusion to a current controversy completely silly.
In order to be fair to President Jordan and to secure clearness of statement I must recapitu
late a little. He quoted Aristotle's axiom, "It is the duty of the State to reach every worthy
end," and then said, "Private individuals cannot analyze baking powders and other adul
terated food, but the State can." lie was in favor of the severe punishment of those who
adulterated food prodncts, and held that "every offender should be fined and sent to jail."
He exaited the authority of the State and invoked the whole force of it against the miscreants
who poison our food.
â¢ Quoting Thomas Jefferson's most profound utterance, "Man has the right to life, liberty
and ihe pursuit of happiness," he thus apDlied to the unemployed: "If all the legislation was
given the unemployed that they ask for it would fill the world with unemployed. It is not a
wise chanty to find work for the unemployed. The enterprise of finding work is what
makes men."
I think that even President Jordan will agree with me that a large part of the work done
now in civilized countries is under the control of organized capitalists and is done by ma
chinery which is rapid in production and has greatly reduced the number of men formerly
employed to do the work. I think ho will also agree with me that this vastly increased fa
cility of production and the large number of gigantic manufacturing establishments make it
an easy matter to produce all the commodities which can find a marketâ so easy, indeed, that
comparatively few are in operation continuously.
If we arc agreed, and I think we are, we shnll have to admit that a great many men are
thus forced out of employment and are engaged In "the enterprise of finding work" ; and since
that "is what makes men," there are some millions in our own country who must be robust
and stalwart men at the present time. I have met some of these men, for they are quite nu
merous iv the streets of San Francisco, and in the country places, 100, and their haggard and
downcast looks, their ragged and soiled clothes, and their piteous plea ior employment did not
impress me with the idea that they were m-idu "men" by "finding work."
I am afraid President Jordan said an unwise thing and an unkind thing, too, for it looks
tome ax if we are to have a great many more men out of employment, since I think the Em
porium and other great department stores have come to stay, because small dealers cannot
compete with them, for tneir combined capital and better business facilities will enable them
to prosper on such small profits as will utterly ruin nnd wipe out the business of our small
dealers, wmlo such large houses as Doaue & Henshelwood aud the Maze will find business un
profitable.
for these and many other like reasons I think President Jordan should slightly revise his
views and say: "It is a'wise charity and a humane thing to find work for the unemployed.
The enterprise of finding work in such times as these and in the present stage of our civiliza
tion is not what makes men, but does unmake them and turns th^m into tramps and very
soon into outlaws." 1 thiDk ho should go iurther and say : "It is the duty of the State to see
that men shall have a chance to get pure food, but it is a far more importanr duty to see that
they have a fair chance to get work and buy the food." And I will try to help him to see how
it can be done and not undo any good thing which we now have.

Postal Savings Banks.
To the Editor of the Call: The wisest and greatest statesman is he who understands and
succeeds in uniting the greatest number of the population in the support of good government.
Pecuniary interest is the best converter to sound principle. People who have nothing to lose
form the really dangerous class of society, because they fall an easy prey to unscrupulous
demagogues and a scurrilous press.
Therefore it should be the aim of statesmen to interest as many people as possible in the
perpetuation ot good government out of self-interest.
All people who are economically inclined to save something should have positive security
for their savings through the National Government. Poor people have lost more money in
savings banks than it would take to pay the National debt. There must be an end to this.
It will never be known how many people have been driven to suicide or into the ranks of the
anarchists through sucn losses. Others have been so discouraged that they never make an
other attempt to save anything. One way vo change this is throueh postal savings banks.
It is not necessary to create many thousand new office-holders to nttend to passbooks
There need not be any passbooks at all, as notes could be printed of $25, $50 and $100, to
bear interest at the rate of $3 65 on $100 per annum, obtainable of any Postmaster in the
land, who would put the stamp of date at the time of sale and would be responsible for the
account. That may solve the currency question, as those notes certainly ought tobeiullyas
good as greenbacks or any other money we have. Every holder of notes would be a sup
porter of the Government ana have an interest in its perpetuation. C. F. Gkabo.

To Protect Pedestrians.
To the Editor of the San Franc i*co Callâ Sir: I would call the attention of the municipal
authorities to a law with reference to bicycle-riders. Why should not all bicyclists be subject
to a license, if only nominal, numbered the same as a cart, carry a lighted lamp after dark
and rlne a bell as a warning at all street crossings?
Accidents have been frequent of late througn the carelessness of riders, and to protect
pedestrians all bicycle-riders should be compelled to have a lamp, bell and number attached
to their machines. Yours respectfully, A. W. & C.

The Way the Harbor For

Demonstrating How Troops Are
Handled With the Great
est Safety.
Three Branches of the Service Ad
vance to Show How They Would
Move to Attack tbe Enemy.
The battle of Golf Hill was fought yes
terday by the representatives of the cav
alry, artillery and infantry stationed at
the Presidio post, and it was a fine demon
stration of what the men would hare done
bad they actually been in front of an
enemy.
There were engaged two troops of cav
alry, two light batterios of the Third Ar
tillery and two companies of infantry in
fatigue uniform, all under the command
of Captain Ramsay D. Potts of Light Bat
tery F.
The plan which was presented by Cap
tain John J. O'Connell, Company E, First
Infantry, was for tbe companies desig
nated to approach Golf Hill from tbe west
for the purpose of defending tbe fortifica
tions at Fort Point from an attack by a
supposed enemy concealed in tbe forest
on tbe northern brow of the hill, which
hill is situated just north of Mountain
Lake, and the problem was to make the
advance in such a manner as to least ex
pose the men to tbe lire of the enemy, and
at tbe same time dislodge and drive back
the supposed enemy.
The several companies formed in front
of their respective quarters and were
marched by a long road to the top of a
hill southwest of Golf HilJ, tbe cavalry
which led being under command of Cap
tain James Lockett of Troop I, the artil
lery under command of First Lieutenant
John D. Barrette of Light Battery C and
the infantry under command of Captain
Charles G. Starr of Company F, First In
fantry.
Shortly after 10 o'clock the cavalry was
seen to approach the top of the south
western hill, where the commander called
a halt, and a survey of tbe ground was
had. Then scouts were sent ahead, after
which skirmishers were sent on in open
order with carbines at ready, and they
moved slowly and cautiously down tbe
grade, and at the same time another de
tachment went northeast and entered a
small forest directly in front of thb line
in which they were marcbing. In a few
minutes they" discovered the enemy, for
there was rapid firing.
Then those who were on Golf Hill saw
the remainder of tbe troop coming down
tbe incline about 200 yards behind the ad
vance, and after these came tbe light bat
teries down the grade, followed by tbe
two companies of artillery, and as the
men were marching onward in battle ar
ray they presented a very interesting pic
ture. Suddenly the troop made a quick
advance up Golf Hill, and as soon as they
reached its crest they were given the word
of command and opened tire on the en
emy. While this was going on tbe light
artillery came up the grade, and the in
fantry was moving in open order toward
the eastern side of the hill at its base to
get out of tbe reach of the shrapnel of the
enemy, which was coming thick and fast.
In quick order, the artillery having
reached a point of vantage, the eight field
pieces were placed in position and fire
was opened on tbe woods in front. The
firing was by piece and report after re
port followed as quickly as the word of
command was given. While these orders
were being carried out the troop moved to
tbe eastward ana from the reports of their
carbines it was apparent that they had
found something to attract their atten
tion and lire, and the infantry at the same
time having gained a position where it
could present a battalion front tired volley
after volley in the direction of the enemy.
For a lew minutes the booming of the
guns, the irregular firing of the carbines
and the reports of the volleys of the in
fantry, together with a view of the several
branches of tbe service gave tbe onlookers
a very realistic idea of what a battle is, ;
and that without any of the attendant |
dangers.
As a bit of practice in the art of war the
event was a success and the men ac
quitted themselves well. When the bat
tle was over the cavalry and the artillery
returned to quarters by the road from tue
bill, while the infantry dashed through the
forest and in that way reached the main
road.

could be crowded into the place and more
than half were ladies. An interesting and en
tertaining programme nad been prepared for
their delectation and the appreciative manner

The Odd fellows' Honored Dead.
The committee on nonored dead, at the
recent session of the Grand Lodge, presented
a report from which the following extract ia
made:
Seventy-nine members of this grand body
have died since we last assembled. This num
ber is in excess of that reported during any
former year of which your committee has
found record.
The number of deaths for the preceding
year was much larger than the number regis
tered during any year prior to 1895-96, which
contributes to emphasize the admonition to
be drawn from the unequaled mortality for
1896-97.
Our inquiries diligently and carefully made
to the extent of our opportunities enable us
to say for the most of these deceasedâ
for ail of whom we gained any direct
and explicit information as to tneir
character and standing in their different
localitiesâ that Odd Fellowship had in them
honorable exemplars, and their departure
from this life was a positive loss to the lodges
of which they were retpectiveiy members, and
tc the community in wnich they dwelt.
Of some of them we can speak with a little
detail, without giving cause to charge or sus
pect invidious distinction. Past Grand Master
Hill was tne only grand master of our juris
diction who at the time of his election and
service as our principal officer was actively
engaged in discharging the duties oi an or
dained clergyman.
He was a man who recognized the beauty
and beneficence of the doctrines of Odd Fel
lowsnip to their fullest extent: and with such
appreciation and with his broad practical
view of the duties which belong to a sincere
advocate of religious principles he be
came warmly attached to the Order of
Odd Fellows; and by his service in the order
he won tne affection and admiration of its
members in this jurisdiction wherever he
formed their personal acquaintance. It is no
disparagement of any of his predecessors or
successors to say that his administration as
grand master was a marked success.
AN EDITOR'S DEATH.
Passing of I-. T. Home, a Well-Known
Printer and Newspaper Man of
This Coast.
L. T. House, one of the oldest and best
known newspaper men on the Pacific
Coast, died early yesterday morning at

debility.
Mr. House came to this City from
Kansas with L S. Kalloch, who afterward
became Mayor of San Francisco, and
started a paper called the Greenbacker.
The publication suspended after a more or
less prosperous career, and House went to
work for tne Bulletin, where he remained
for several years. Later he started a paper
at Kedondo Beach, and at different times
during 'he past few years conducted
papers in various portions of the State be
sides being employed in the State Print
ing Office.
For tÂ»e past three years he has edited
the Hayes Valley Advertiser, of which
Under Sheriff William Clack is the pro
prietor.
Deceased leaves a widow and two chil
dren, a son and daughter.
He was a member of Fidelity Lodge No.
I 136 of the Ancient Order of United Work
men, and of the Typographical Union.
The latter organization will take charge
of the funeral, ana the remains will be
buried in the printers' plat in Laurel Hill
Cemetery to-morrow. House was 73 years
of age and his collapse came suddenly,
&* a few weeks ago lie seemed to be iM
good health and spirits.

Ktady to Go to "Work.
A number of the City employes wao were apÂ»
pointed by the Board of Supervisors yesterday
filed their oaths of office and bonds yesterday
and will take their positions to-day. There
was considerable grumbling and threats of re
prisals at future elections from those Runey
ites who were turned out and more than one
appeared at the hall in a state that suggested
that they had been celebrating their release
from the onerous duties of office.

DOCKING OF THE
BIG SHIP DIRIGO
Almost Given Up She Came
in Looking Like a
Yacht.
The Galilee, From Tahiti, Was
Decking at the Same Time
at the Same Wharf.
Arrival of Prescott Sawyer's Long-
Overdue Yacht Josephine
From Seattle.
The docking of the only American stee!
ship afloat and that of the brig Galilee at
Howard-street wharves yesterday was one
of the prettiest pieces of tugboating ever
seen on the bay. The Spreckels tug Vigi
lant, Captain John Silovicli, had to re
move the schooner Queen before either
vessel could make her berth. She was
just outside her landing when the Dingo
and Galilee hove in sight. The big ship
was in tow of the Active and the Red
mond had charge of the Galilee. For a
few minutes all six vessels were bunched,
ana then the Galilee beean to forge
ahead. The captain of the Redmond soon
ran his tow alongside a schooner that was
lying at the head of Howard No. 2, and
therefore made it more difficult to dock
the Dirigo. Captain Joe Trttwin was equal
to the occasion, however, and one of the
prettiest jobs ever done on trie water front
was the result. The big 2800-ton ship was
handled like a yacht and placed aloncside
the wharf ten minutes later than tne
Galilee.
In talking about the trip Captain Good
win said: "Why on earth did you people
put us down as overdue? We are a few
days over an average passage, but any
body who knows the Horn would never
have placed the Dirigo among the overdue
fleet. After the Howth spoke us we en
countered a gale that lasted four days.
All our canvas was blown away and for
thirty hours the ship was under bare
poles.
"The run from New Yorfc to the Cape
was made in fifty-seven days and at that
time I would have wagered all the money
I have in the world that I would have
made the run to San Francisco in 130
days. The storm blew me back and then
1 had to zigzag my way back to my origi
nal position. From 50 south our general
run was sixty miles a day. Off Ma?a
Fuera Island we lay becalmed for a week,
and from that on we bad nothing but
light winds and calms. Just to show bow
everything was against us I have made
the run from 50 south to the equator in 17
days 8 hours in the ship Sterling, whereas
it took me tifty uays to cover tne same
distance this trip."
To look at tue DiriÂ»o no ono would ever
think she bad been battered and beaten
around the Horn. She looks as trim alow
and aloft as a yacht and her sides show
no signs of heavy weatner. Waves broke
over her continuously, but not a bolt
started and the vessel is now, after her
severe test, classed as one of the finest
steel vessels afloat. She may not be a flier,
but as a sample of American workman
ship there is nothing afloat superior to the
Dirigo.
The brig Galilee, which arrived from
Tahiti, brought very little news. The war
was over and the natives who escaped the
French forces were returning to their vil
lages. The gunboats that took: the Queen
and high chief to New Caledonia and th*
minor chiefs and principal rebels to an
island of the Marquesas group, had not
returned and in consequence Papeete was
desolate. According to the officers of the
Galilee the trouble is now over forever
and tne natural productiveness of the Is
lands is so great that in a few months no
one will ever know that there had been a
war. The Galilee left in port the schooner
Norms, which was to sail for San Fran
cisco April 14 last.
The schooner yacht Josephine arrived
from Tacoma yesterday after a fair pas
sage of fourteen days. Prescott Sawyer,
son of the late Circuit Judge Sawyer, was
in command of her, and at one time she
was given up for lost. However, a gale
sprang up ana the little boat was an
chored in safe shelter. When the gale
subsided the Josephine mnde a fresh start
The party is on pleasure bent.
The ship Elwell arrived from Nanaimo
yesterday, having made the round trip in
twenty-eight days. As Captain Ryder ha 3
again broken ttie thirty-day record Mr.
Mighles will again have to pay for a $30
suit for dim.
The sloop-of-war Alert came down from
Mare Island yesterday after a thorough
overhauling. Sne will go to Alaska and
at Sitka will take the Pinta in tow. The
latter "warsnip" has been condemned
and will come to Mar* Island to discharge
her crew. Then the old-time relic will go
on the retired list.
Captain "Pete" Ott, the most popular
pilot in California, has been a very sick
man for the last two weeks. Yesterday
he was able to be around again for a few
hours, and the greeting he received did
him more good tcan all the medicine he
had taken.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia sailed for Honolulu yesterday after
noon with the following cabin passengers:
Miss Mary Allen, A. B. Bauman, Miss S. Bay

Annie Waller and five children.
Nearly all of them had Iriends down to
see them off, and all had bouquets to pre
sent to their friends before the steamer
pnlled out. In consequence tbe side of
the Australia next the wnarf looked more
like a bower, albeit there was many a
handkerchief in sight.
The following masters of sailine vessels

Thomas Henry Nolan made his escape
from Rocklin, Placer County, a few days
ago and was locked up in the Harbor
police station. This is the third time the
9-year-old has attempted to circumnavi

has met his Nemesis in San Francisco.
Captain Dunleavy easily recognized the
little fellow yesterday and at once tele
graphed to his father, who is a well-known
miner in Placer County. The requisite
funds were telegraphed and "Tom" is
probably now safe at home In Rocklin.

Presented to the Court and Jury as
a Guileless Yomg Man Who Suf
fered From a Conspiracy.
Carl W. yon Tiedemann felt considera
ble relief yesterday afternoon when D-p
--uty District Attorney Black announced to
Judge Wallace that the prosecution had
no further testimony to offer touching
Yon Tiedemann's gnilt on a charge of
perjury for swearing that Mrs. Sarah
Owen Spencer impersonated Mrs. Harriet
P. Christy.
After a brief consultation with his client
Attorney Alexander Campbell made a pre
liminary statement of what he expected
to prove in the case for Yon Tiedeinann's
defense. Mr. Campbell said he would
show to the satisfaction of the jury that
Yon Tiedemann was an inexperienced
young man who had a little money and
wanted to go in business for hinnelf ; that
he looked about him and was attracted by
the real estate outlook, so he opened an
office for the selling and renting of land;
that while thus engaged he feii a victim
to the schemes of that chief of swindlers,
Guy S. Whitcomb, who was assisted in his
viie schemes by John H. Fidler, Lincoln
Carr and others who are unknown to the
police.
Mr. Campbell said he would further
prove that the unscrupulous person- he
had named conspired to defraud not only
the clients of Yon Tiedemann but Yon
Tiedemann himself, and that this prosecu
tion ii being pressed by some who had
not Deen as successful as they had hopud
in obtaining boodie.
Yon Tiedemann througn the trial has
maintained his dignified deportment. lie
is constantly attended by two faithful
friends who are present at every session
of the court.
In the first part of the day John H. Fid
ler, alias Pratt, alias Christy, a convict
now doing time in the State Prison at Fol
som, K'jt nieii that he was associated with
Yon Tiedemann in the fraudulent transac
tion which led to the mortgaging of prop
erty belonging to Mrs. Harriet P. Christy,
and that Yon Tiedemann knew all about
the false impersonation of Mt.Â«. Christy
when he swore that the person looked like
it picture of Sarah Owen Spencer; that, in
fact, Yon Tiedemaun knew it was not Mrs.
Spencer who impersonated Mrs. Christy.
Lincoln Carr, a former partner of Yon
Tiedemann, who is now serving a term in
the State Prison at Folsom, for a transac
tion in which Fidler and Yon Tiedemann
were said to be interested, was called as a
witness for tbe prosecuiion. He proved a
voluble talker and gave a detailed history
of his connection with Yon Tiedemann.
He said he was present when Guy 8.
Whitcomb and John S. Fidler had a talk
with Thompson, one of the victims of the
half-interest swindlers. He did not hear
all that was caid, but heard them demand
$150 oi Thompson. Learning that Thomp
son had only $100 they agreed to taice ttiat
ana he went to the bank to get tne money.
Thompson subsequently came in andgavÂ«
the money to Fidler. He *a\v coma $_*0
gold pieces. Whitcomb and a man named
Egbert were also present and Yon Tiede
mann was concerned in the affair.
Carr swore that he advised Thompson to
have nothing to do with the job that was
being offered to him by Whitcomb and the
otners.
No definite information could be ob
tained from Carr in regard to the forgery
of Mrs. Christy's signature and the pro
duction of a bogus mortgage on her prop
erty, but the witness was permuted to
recount a sij,niticant conversation be
tween Yon Tiedeman and Whitcomb.
"One day in 1894 Whitcomb came into
our office," said Carr, "and began to talk
with Yon Tiedeman. He was telling how
he intended to do up San Francisco before
he left. He said he knew of several good
modes of doing business; that if he only
had possession of a good piece of property
or the title to it he could raise the money
easily. To this Yon Tiederaan replied: 4 i
will get the property if you will sot tflÂ»
money.' Taen Whitcomb said: 'I
can get the money all right; I'll
carry my end all right,' and Yon Tiede
man again said: 'I'll carry my part of it
througii all right.' I didn't hear them
say what property it was they wonld get."
Mr. Campbell produced a long letter
written in the County Jail and asked Carr
if he was the author. At first he was in
clined to deny, but at last said that it
looked like his handwriting, and finally
admitted that it whs sent Dy him in reply <
to notes sent him by Yon Tiedeman. The
first part of it is as follows:
March 21.
That I may not forget the day of the month
I will write for a little note, In part reply to
yours. Ido not think that some parties are
doing just right by letting me stay here and
not so much as to corae to see me when I'm
the only thing to stop them from taking a free
ride. 1 allowed myself to be brought here to
save then), thouuh" eminent counsel advised
me not to do so, but to give them all up. I
thought I had better suffer the ignominy of
jai! life for a few days Sf need be rather than
one person should lose a few of the best years
of their lives if this sacrifice can nave them.
.\fy case cannot be made better or worse by
any one except the knowledge of What you
gave me and I cannot swear where that came
lrom, as I saw no money paid to any one.
Then follows a detailed plan to be fol
lowed by Yon Tiedemaun in giving his tes
timony so that all might get out of the
scrape without being jailed for a long term.
In this heexonerated VonTiedemann from
blame. One paragraph reads:
I also told bim (Lees) that the men came
there and did the talking and then left; that
I saw no money paid to any one and got no
money myself.
Before he got through Carr was com
pelled to admit that he had slept with Half
interest Swindler Whitcomb and that he
had been in partnership with several other
ii.iif-iatc!ro-t swindlers, some of whom are
fugitives from justice.
The taking of testimony for the defense
will be^in to-day.

B-.
No Arrangements Hay* Yet Been
Made for tbe Quiet July
Wedding.
A. H. Small, the popular young society
and club man, is about to forsake the
ranks of bachelordom and take unto him
self a wife. The lady who is going to
make Mr. Small the happiest of men is
Mrs. Annie Laurie Worcester, daughter of
Colonel and Mrs. J. P. Jackson.
The young couple have been engaged for
some four week 9, and have as yet made
no formal announcement Tbe secret,
which was certainly too good to keep,
came out inadvertently yesterday, and
while it will not altogether astonish their
friends, will doubtless pleasantly surprise
tnern.
No arrangements have as yet bean made
for the wedding. All that nan thus far
been decided is that the ceremony will
take place in July and is to be extremely
ouiet.
" Mr. Small is preparing a home for bis
bride on (Jctavia street, between Wash
ington and Jackson, and here, after tbe
honeymoon, the newly wedded pair will
go to housekeeping.
BARRY'S FRAGRANT WEEDS.
Stolen From the Justice's Chamber*
and Had < ijjam Substituted.
One of the recent burglaries that has not
been reported to the police, but threatens
to establish a wide breach between Jus
tices of the Peace, occurred threedays ago
at the City Hall, in the chambers ot Jus
tice Barry.
The latter discovered that his special
apartment had been visited during bis
temporary absence and that bis private
desk had been entered.
The only property stolen wbi about
eighty 25-cent cigars remaining out ot a
box of 100 presented the Justice last week
by an admirer of bis.
Tbe thief, however, must have entered
some otber place sbortly before that time,
purloining other cigars, of a rope kind,
which be thoughtfully substituted for the
better and fragrant weeds.
Justice Barry is very sore over the oc
currence, although bis friends, and par
ticularly Justice Groezinger, who bare
all been smokinc particularly good dears
of late, laugh the matter off as a capital
joke. _

CHINESE BURGLAR
TO BE DEPORTED
Lee Sing Will Leave by
the Next Steamer
for China.
He Has Served Four Terms for
Burglary and Twice Es
caped Conviction.
The Police Balieve He Murdered
Policeman Jobn Nicholson Thlr
. ten Tears Ago
Lee Sine, alias Lee Ah KÂ«e, alias Lee
Ah Wing, who was arrested Monday by
Detectives Gibson and Wren for stealing a
diamond ring from a servant-girl in the
house of Mrs. Popper, Castro street, where
he was a cook, is an ex-convict and will be
deported to China by tbe next steamer.
Lee has for years been suspected of be
ing the murderer of Policeman John
Nicholson in the early morning of Feb
ruary Hi, 1884, which at the time caused a
great sensation throughout the City.
Prior to the murder Lee had been twice
convicted and served terms in San Quen
tin for burglary, and twice be bed escaped
punishment for burglary and robbery
through insufficient evidence. He was
first sentenced on October 12, 1878, to two
and a half years under the name of Lee
Ah Kee, and on November 27, 1880, he got
four years under the name of Lee Ah
Wing.
Nicholson was patrolling bin beat in the
early morning of February lU, 1884, when
he discovered a Chinese burglar in a
grocery on the oorner of Pacific and Leav
enworth streets. The burglar ran out of
the place and up tbe bill pursued by
N icholson, who kept firing at him to make
him atop.
After running about a block and a half
Nicholson after emptying his revolver
overtook the burglar while he wbb crossing
a vacan: lot. The burglar was carrying a
clock and he wheeled round and threw it
at Nicholson, striking hinion the forehead
and partially stunning him. Then with a
sharp chisel tbe burglar cut Nicholson's
throat, severing the jugular vein.
There was a hook and ladder company
close by and hearing the shooting firemen
ran out and found Nicholson stretched
out on the vacant lot dead, with his finger
on the trigger of his revolver. The burg
lar had escaped, but his shoes, the clock
and the chisel were found in the vicinity
of the murder.
Every effort was made to find the mur
derer and several Chinese were arrested,
bat as nothing could be proved against
them they were released from custody.
Lee fled to Sacramento County and
about two months afterward was arrested
lor burglary there and on July 19 was sen
tenced to five years under the name of
Ah Kee. Whllo in the Sacramento jail
awaiting his trial he spoke of Nicholson's
murder and showed such a familiarity
with the details and tbe locality that sus
picion since then has pointed to him as
the murderer.
On November 3, 1888, he was again
sentenced in thia City to five years for
burglary and was sent to the Folsom
penitentiary. On thia occasion he gave
ihe name of Lee Ah Lee.
Detectives Gibson and Wren had a talk
with him yesterday morning about Nichol
son's murder. He insisted that be was in
San Quentin serving a sentence at the
time, but the records show that he was at
liberty then and for two months later,
when he was arrested in Sacramento
County.
The detectives saw the United States
District Attorney yesterday and, after sub
mitting Lee's criminal record, it was de
cided to deport Lee by the next steamer
for China, where his head will likely be
cnt off.

FOUND A MAN
IN A BIG JAR
Queer Painted Beads and
Images in the Mounds
of Tonola.
Marvelous Buried City in Which
Trees Have Grown That
Are Centuries Old.
EL R Freear Tells of the Ancient
Temples and Brilliant Birds
Unknown to Scienc?.
From time to time lately word has been
received here of strange mounds and
buried cities on the borders of Tehuante
pec and in the remote stretch of the con
tinent toward Yucatan. However, no
eye-witness of these relics of bygone ages
has arrived here, and in the minds of
many the stories of the wonders observed
there have been taken with grains of
allowance.
Notwithstanding this it is unquestioned
that tlie ancient mounds, built for what
ever purpose, do exist, and it is also cer
tain a city has been discovered so old that
trees as much as four or five feet thick
have grown up among the ruined temples.
H. R. Freear of this City, who with sev
eral friends went to Tapachuls, in the
extreme southern part of Mexico, sev
eral months ago, has returned here. [
He says that at a point about eight miles
from the port of Tonola he and his party
found three great mounds. Each was
from 25 to 30 feet high and from GO to 75
feet across at the base. In one of these he
and his party being short of water began
digging. They commenced at a point
about six feet from the ground and dug
down about four and a half feet. At that
depth they Btruck a huge jar made of
earthenware.
"It was about four feet high, three feet
wide and nearly half an inch thick," said
Mr. Freear, "and what do you suppose
was in it? A human skeleton. It was
the skeleton of a very big man, because
ray uncle, E. J. Crabtree, who was with
me, and who is a very big man himself,
took the thighbone and measured it with
his own. It extended over two or three
inches. The skeleton was complete, none
of the bones being wanting. It appeared
that the body had been pressed down in
the jar. Around the jar, scattered through
the soil, were many beads in brieht color?.
There were heads of alligators, cows, one
deer head, ii^l. and other figures of ani
mals of different kinds, all in earthen
ware, as well as several kinds of pottery.
We dug through the soil with a machete,
and had no difficulty in rinding a great
many strange relics. They bad no doubt
been buried there for hundreds of years.
The natives there refer to the mounds a3
the work of the antiguas or ancients.
"While this was very remarkable it was
nothing to a discovery made near Comotan
in a great forest not far from the border of
Yucatan. In that forest is a very old city
with a street extending for more than a
mile, where stone temples and many
other kinds of buildings may be seen.
Some of tbe buildings have withstood the
effects of time and are intact, or nearly so,
while others have fallen partly down, the
stones being scattered every which way.
"In the streets of this silent city, once Â«o
busy with life, and growing up through
the houses, were to be seen enormous
forest trees. Many of the trees were as
much as live feet each :n diameter. It
had been hundreds and maybe thousands
of years since the strange city baa been
deserted of humankind. The temples,
many of them, were m a good state of
preservation. In tbe rooms were things
used in household affairs, and thousands
on thousands of more valuable antiquities
of different kinds. It is a most interesting
field lor an explorer, especially if of a
scientific turn of mind.
"When Igo back, as I expect soon to
do, I shall take, if possible, one or two
scientists with me- I especially want to
take along a skilled taxidermist, because
there are many remarkable birds there or
rare plumage and of a kind not to be
found in such collections as are to be seen
at the Academy of Sciences and other
places here. For some years I have been
taking a special interest in the birds of
different countries, and because of this I
have traveled many thousands of miles in
Lower California and different States of
Mexico and Central America."
Mr. Freear is at the International and
will probably remain there several days.
in Zululand, wben tbe moon is at tbe
full, objects are distinctly visible at as
great a distance as seven miles. By star
light one can see to read print with ease.

CARVALHO ON THE
SCIENCE OF PASTE
The Expert Encounters a
Formidable Rival in
Mr. Foote.
Component Parts of Manufac
tured Adherents Discussed
at Length.
Then Notary Cooney's Ink Was the
Theme, and Finally the Deeds
Are Considered.
Expert David Carvaiho impresses one
as being wise enough when it comes to
giving dissertations on handwriting and
inks, but he has a formidable rival in
Attorney W. W. Foote when paste and
corn starch are under consideration.
The New York handwriting wonder
blundered at yesterday's session of the
Fair-Craven trial when he presumed to
intrude upon Mr. Foote's domain in this
regard. He was listened to with gaping
wonder and admiration as long as he
delved into the mystories of ink-making
and ink slinging, ink vagaries and ink
analyses, for it was profound and brain
clouding. But as to paste â well, that was
another story. True, Carvaiho started off
to wade into this particular branch of
service, but it happened that Mr. Foote
used to make kites, and, necessarily, his
own paste, when a youngster, and iv after
years expanded his knowledge of the ad
herent-mating art from this nucleus un
til he can now talk fluently about subtle
mixtures of the pulverized innermost
kernel of a corn grain with a preparation
of wheat and mysterious fluids; about
the infinitesimal component parts of glue
and gelatine and wherein they differed ;
end about the scientific possibilities of
dissolving fly-paper and other mucilag
inous substances with spirits.
It all came about when the high-salaried
expert was asked by George A. Knight,
who is now acting as chief counsel for the
heirs and executors of the Fair estate, to
explain how Noiary Cooney's official ac
knowledgments had been attached to
the deeds said to nave been given Mrs.
Nettie R. Craven Dy Senator Fair. This
means that, in order to answer intelli
gently, Mr. Carvaiho should know all
about paste and mucilage. He announced
from the stand that he did know this, and
then Mr. Foote asked for the simple priv
ilege of testing the witness' efficiency as
an expert in this respect. This granted
he proceeded to wind Carvaiho up into a
knot. The expert said he had made thou
sands of pots of paste and mucilage for
use in his business as a photographer and
knew what ingredients he had resorted to.
Yes, and he iiad made paste for kites, too,
and his recollection was tnat flour and
water comprised the secret of that recipe.
The fine art of paste-making had, he must
confess, progressed, somewhat since his
kite days. Corn starch is now the chief
ingredient.
Mr. Foote wrung another confession
from the expert and that was that there
were some brands of mucilage and paste
that he had never manufactured, and,
after all, knew but little about. Carvalno
was compelled to qualify his original as
sertion tbat he knew everything, or even
as much about sticky substances and
compounds as Mr. Foote, and that was
just what the attorney was aiming at.
"He will find that I know something
else besides paste and mucilage, when I
get at him on cross-examination," whis
pered Mr. Foote to one of bis associates
after his victory over Carvaiho.
But tcis was only an incident of the
session.
The New York expert occupied the wit
ness-stand all day and continued to give
direct testimony regarding the so-named
"pencil" will and the disputed deeds. He
testified in great detail. For instance,
during the morning session be called at
tention to the word "to" appearing on
the fourth line of the pencil will, and said
tnat his microscopical study of the same
seemed to indicate that there had been an
erasure, and the word written twice. The
word "shared" on the fifth line nad been
written in pieces and had been retouched.
He found further alleged discrepancies in
the word "brother" located on the six
teenth line, claiming that it was jerky
and written with "thought and effort."
He found another "brother" in an ad
mittedly genuine writing of Fair's, and
said there were no evidences of hesitancy
shown in its writing. The word "dollars,"
on the nineteenth line of the wili, was
similarly picked to pieces and then com
pared with a like word in one of Fair's
business letters. The words "Legisla
ture" and "States" were also alleged Dy
by the expert to show signs of retouching.
Carvaiho was, at the opening of the aft
ernoon session, again picking out words
here and there in the disputed will, which
he opined, were tracings and not written
by Senator Fair. This lasted for some
time, and then the expert wound up by
saying that altogether he had found over
a hundred instances in the will where, in
his opinion, the words had either been
pieced or retouched. On that he based
his blanket opinion that the will was a
fabricated document.
Continuing and branching off on a lec
turing tour, Carvaiho said he had made a
careful study of Senator Fair's handwrit
ing, and found that it was replete with
idiosyncrasies, vagaries and oddities.
"Still," said Carvalno, "I find that Sen
ator Fair was consistent in his inconsist
encies, whereas the writing in this will is
inconsistent in its inconsistencies."
"Whew! What's all ihat?" said Mr.
Foote, scrambling to his feet in a dazed
manner. "Inconsistent in inconsisten
cies, idiosyncrasies, vagaries and oddities
â why, I object to all this because it's un
intelligible/
"I understand it very clearly," said Mr.
Knight, loftily.
"Oh, but you're brainy," was the retort.
The court thought tbat Carvalho's evi
dence was bordering too much upon an
argument or lecture and smoothed mat
ters down by instructing the witness to
limit himself to simply answering ques
tions.
There was but little more ado about the
will after that, and the disputed deed to
the Mission-street property was produced.
Carvaiho said he had made several care
ful examinations of this document and
had reached th* conclusion that the body
of it was not a simulated handwriting. It
was a fairly natural specimen of "some
body's writing."
When asked if he had noticed anything
peculiar about the body of the deed â tbat
is, the writing filled in between the
printed phrases â Carvaiho said he had
found what appeared to have been an
erasure where the name of the grantee,
Nettie R. Craven, waa located. In other
words, what he was endeavoring to tell
the jury was that the name waa written
over the erasure.
While this was going on Judge Denson
of counsel for the defense scrutinized the
photographic copy of the deed and re
marked that it did not look the same as
the original. The attorneys for the other
side took this as meaning that the docu
ment had been tampered with and raised
a fuss about it. The affair subsided, how
ever, when Carvaiho denied that he had
ever had the deed actually iv his hands
previous to the irial. and therefore could
not have mutilated it.
The expert next devoted his attention
to the acknowledgment of this particular
deed. He said he was of the belief that
the writing thereon was in two different
kinds of ink and also that two different
pens had been . used. The writiner sup
posed to have been executed by Notary
Cooney was, he said, in different ink and
by a different pen from that purporting
to have been written by Fair. He also
ventured the opinion that the writings
were executed at two different "sittings.
- Mr. Foote waited to know if Carvalno
had analyzed the ink by chemical process,
but the expert confessed that he had
reached his opinion only by a microscopi
cal examination. '
The deed for the Pine-street property
was next examined and Carvaiho said it
was very similar to the other. He thought
he also detected the use of different pens
and inks in the acknowledgment.
The expert was about to give testimony
regarding the disputed signatures of Sen
ator Fair when court adjourned until to
day. , _________^_^
A HEAVY FRUIT CEOP.
Angeiinr Barham of I ehafna on the
County's Varied Products.
County Assessor J. L. Barham of Te
hama arrived here from Red Bluff yester
day and is at the Grand.
"The winter-sown wheat and other grain
is very good in Tehama," he said. "The
summer fallow grain is fair, but not what
it ought to be. The weather was very
cool for a time, and witn the wind that
came with it had its influence on the crop.
There will be about half a crop of summer
fallow. Fruits of all Kinds are good.
There is an abundance of everything in
that line. The wool crop is large and
sheep men have received a fairly good
advance over last year, yet they did not
get what they anticipated. The prices
have been from 10)^ to 12 cents."
Mr. Barham is hr re on a business trip
and will remain a few days.
CANNOT CARRY FREIGHT.
The Market â¢ Street Railway
Company's Powers and
Rights Defined.
Aitomey-G neral Fi z;erald Readers
an Opinion to the Park Com
missioners.
In the opinion of Attorney-General
Fitzgerald, tbe Market-street Railroad
Company has no power or right to carry
freight over its lines.
Some time ago it was proposed to carry
the sweepings of the streets to Golden
Gate Park by means of cars attached to
the passenger cars of the company, and
the Park Commissioners asked the At
torney-General whether such a proceeding
would be legal.
Mr. Fitzgerald's opinion was sent to the
commission some time ago and was trans
mitted to the Board of Supervisors yes
terday. It iÂ« as follows:
As I understand the proposition of
the Market-street Railway Company, which
is contained in a letter from their
general manager, Mr. Vinlng, they pro
pose, if the consent of the Board of Super
visors can be obtained authorizing the
construction of some necessary connecting
tracks, to enter into a contract with your
board for a period of three years to haul the
street sweepings of the City over the various
lines of tbat system, and to deliver them at
certain designated places in the park at a
price of thirty centÃ per cubio yard. In other
words, the Market-street Railway Company
proposes to act as a special carrier of freight in
conveying these sweepings from various points
In the City to the park at the compensation
designated. Without passing upou the power
of your board to contract for fertilizing ma
terial to be delivered at the park I am of the
opinion that the proposed contract is one
which the Market-street Railway Company is
without authority of law to make, as it is
ultra vires the purpose for which that eor
poratiou was organized, and that, therefore,
it would be an invalid contract.
After quoting from tne company's
articles ot incorporation to show the pur
poses for which the combine was organ
ized, tbe Attorney-General continues:
So far, then, as its transportation business
is concerned, this corporation is limited to
tbe operation of street railroads. It is well
settled that a distinctive ana essential feature
of a street railway, in relation to other rail
roads, is that it is exclusively for the transpor
tation of passengers and not of goods.
The Attorney-General cites a number
of authorities in support of his position.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 19, 1897.
CHARITY RACING
IT INGLESIDE
Society Did Not Turn Out
Largely to View the
Sport.
The Finishes Were Tame Witb
but One Favorite in
Front
Los Prietos Finally Won at Good
Oddsâ San Marco Beaten Out by
Collins in a Drive.
There wai racing at Ingletide Track yes
terday ior "sweet charity's sake," and it
was generally supposed that society would
grace the occasion witn its presence, but a
powerful telescope would have failed to
reveal over a half doien members of the
upper crust perched away in a corner of
the clubhouse balcony, or possibly a
select two or three in a secluded portion
of the grand-stand. But the regulars were
there the same as on other days, and the
sport progressed in tee usual humdrum
way, without accident or incident worthy
of note.
The fields were small, and Starter James
B. Ferguson, who officiated witb the red
bunting, experienced little difficulty in
sending them away. One or two races
wore a glossy surface, but might not bear
a closer inspection, though as a whole the
game was pretty good. It was not a red
letter day for favorites, for but one out of
the six spoke the judges first.
Charley Macklin's good ride on the 8 to
1 chance, Los Prietos, in the two-year-old
scramble at five furlongs, won the race
for that youngster. Towanda, the 3 to 5
favorite, and Miss Remsen, the second
choice, raced themselves to death the first
part and when Macklin finally made bis
move he had no difficulty in beating the
favorite a neck.
There was at least one of the six entries
in the seven-furlone selling event that
followed, trying, and that was the winner,
Adam Andrew. The wise money all went
in on him at odds of 3 and ','â ''. to 1. He
was allowed to make all his own running
and won easily from Velox. The even
money choice, George Palmer, finished in
the show.
With Crescendo scratched and the
weight on King William 117 instead of
127, as originally given out, the six-furlong
purse race looked a good thing for that
horse and he was played down to 1 to 2
favoritism. Mercutio at fours in the
ring, ridden by Shaw, gave him a good
argument, bnt at the wire he downed the
latter colt a head, with McLight a lapped
on third.
Peixotto, the fast and acrobatic Brutus
.sprinter, had plenty of sand in his craw
yesterday, a nd in the six and a half fur
long sprint, decided under selling condi
tions, made a show of his field in fast
time. He receded in the betting from 7to
2 to 5 to 1, and haying the footing over the
4 to 5 favorite Mainstay from the jump,
led him past the winning line by five
lengths in 1:21^, equaling the tracK
record. Old Logan was a distant third in
front of Verapua and William 08.
Finishing a good second to Judge Denny
on Saturday last, Collins came out in the
mile and a sixteenth selling affair, and in
a drive defeated the 11 to 10 choice, San
Marco, ridden by Marty Bergen. The
favorite and Daylight cut out a merry clip
to the Mretcu, where the field closed on
them. Opposite to the paddock Clawson,
on Collins, pulled away from the bunco
and led the first choice out by three-fourths
of a length, with Ransom a good third.
The winner was 4 1 2 ' to lin the betting.
After booking nad progressed on the
six starters in the final mile run for some
minute*, Mat Storn, owner of Horatio,
the favorite, discovered that his horse was
not eligible to start in the race and re
porting the fact to the judges the colt was
scratched and twenty minutes allowed to
make a new book. Imp. France was then
made a pronounced choice and the ride
she received at the hands of tibepard
should relegate that corkscrew composi
tioned youth to the sheep-herding busi
ness for evermore. After being cut off on
three different occasions he made a feeble
bluff at the end, only to be beaten out a
couple of lengths by Con Moto, the third
choice, which was allowed to make the
pace. Jack Martin was third. ,
NOTEs.
Fourteen bookmakers weighed in yes
terday.
A. B. Sprockets, ex-president, and W.
S. Leake, ex-secretary of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club, visited the races yesterday.
Both gentlemen' were busy shaking hands
with their many friends.
Adam Andrew was bid up $200 over his
entered selling price by "Jim" Quinn.
Some day Velox will get some sort of a
ride and win a race.
Much fanlt was lound at Piggott's ride

DOUBLE MURDER
NARROWLY AVERTED
Samuel Johnson, a Drunken
Hostler, on the
Warpath.
He Fires a Shot at Dr. Holm
gren, Who Owed Him a
Few Dollars.
Policeman T. J Dugan, While A'Â«
tempting to Arrest Him, Has
a Narrow Escape
Samuel Johnson, a hostler, 34 yean of
age, attempted to commit a double mur
der last night and he has been lucky to
escape with a charge of assault to murder
against him.
Johnson had been employed by Dr.
Holmgren, northeast corner Buchanan
street and Golaen Gate avenue, and the
doctor owed him a few dollars. He want
to the doctor's residence Monday night to
get bis money, but as he was considerably
under the influence of liquor he was told
to return when he was sober.
Johnson, still laboring under the effects
of his libation* and feeling incensed at
not getting his money, went to the doc
tor's residence last night about 9 o'clock-.
The doctor lives in the upper flat, and in
the room with him were bis son John and
a boarder when Johnson made his ap
pearance.
He again demanded his money and was
told he was not yet sober. He declared
he would not leave the room till be got it,
and Policeman T. J. Dugan went to the
bouse and Johnson promised to behave
himself. Ducan left, and as he reached
the bottom of the stairs he met Special
Officer Brod field.
They were talking about the disturb
ance, when they heard a shot. They both
rushed upstairs, Dugan being ahead, and
as he opened the door Johnson was stand
ing facing Dr. Holmgren with a revolver
in his band. He had fired at the doctors
son, but the bullet fortunately missed him.
As Johnson beard the door open he
wheeled round and quickly raised the
revolver, pointing it at Dugan, who made
a rush at him. As he tiki so Johnson fired.
The bullet grazed Dugan's right cheek
bone and went throuerh the rim of his hel
met His right eyelash and eyebrow were
singed with the burned powder and his
cheek was powder-burned. He had a nar
row escape, and his eye will trouble him
for some time.
Dugan and Bradfield grappled with
Johnson and soon overpowered him, tak
ing the revolver from him. Two of the
chambers were empty. The shots at
tracted quite a crowd and tne wildest ex
citement reigned for a time, as it was ru
mored that some one bad been killed.
Johnson was taken to the City Prison
and booked on the charge of assault to
.murder. He aays he went to the house to
get his money and was arguing with the
doctor when the policeman came into the
room. He did not remember firing any
shots, as he got scared when he saw the
policeman and did not know what he was
doing.
It was afterward learned that the man's
true name is Samuel Soren^en, and not
Johnson.
DAVIS' WILL.
Judge Coffer Hu Obtained a Jury to
AsaUt In fettling the Million-
Dollar Content.
Judge Coffey and half a dozen lawyers
devoted yesterday afternoon to filling the
panel of jurors for the purpose of trying;
the contest of the will of the late Jacob Z.
Davis.
The following-named citizens were
finally chosen to serve in that capacity:
Henry L. Davis, John Lynch, William W.
Hobart, James Den man, M. J. O'Neill,
Charles Quinn, H. W. Hathorne, Michael
Flood, John Ti-deman, Thomas B. Evans,
James Aifeld, Daniel Ward.
The contestants are Catherine Stead
and Elizabeth V. Wilson, and the pro
ponents of the will are Mr?. Lizzie Muir
ana Mrs. Belle Curtis. It is estimated
that the property involved is worth not
less than $1,000,000, and may be valued at
much more.
Theodore Kytka, an expert in pictog
raphy and microscopy, made an examina
tion of the will yesterday and declared
that two kinds of ink had been used in
writing the document. On this basis the
will is to be attacked, as it i- holographic
in form, and if the date is by another
hand, as Mr. KytKa alleges, that would
be a fatal defect. The proponents of the
will declare that it is a perfectly legal and
valid document in every respect.
Taking of testimony will begin at 11
o'clock to-morrow morning.
The Governor Is Satisfied.
The Governor is not disturbed by ex-
Senator Gesford's long complaint over the
appointment of Andrew J. Clunie to till
the vacancy in the office of Insurance
Commissioner caused by the resignation
of M. R. Higgins. As Mr. Clnnie was
already commissioned to fill the full term
of Commissioner, the insurance men re
quested the Governor to appoint Clunie
to till the vacancy.

How the Guatemalan Don \

GATHERED HER FAMILY i
TO HIS HEART.
The Gay O!d Lover Had a
Fine Turn for the
Romantic
LISPED HIS PASSION IN BAD
SPANISH.
Attorney Dimond Declares That ths
Whole Blair Family Were
Deceived by Barillas.
If the lawyers are permitted to have
their way there will be no romance and
poetry about Barillas and his loves. It
MISS BLAIR Lis ens as Attorney Dimond Tells How Barillas Wooed and Won Her.
was shameful enough to picture him play
fully Jittering the carpets of a prospective
mother-in-law at a time when she, dazzled
by his title and tbe stories of his coffee
plantations, feared to remonstrate. Now
they are picturing Don' Juan, not as a
tuneful cavalier at all. but as singing
faulty metaphors in bad Spanish and
worse English. And those fifteen million
pesos that helped open the heart of Miss
LiiJia Blair are going in the shuffle with a
rapidity that threatens bankruptcy, for it
appears now that tbe legal sharps have
discovered that at most there was not
much over half a million as an available
balm for tbe wrenched affections of his
many admirers.
But this detraction must cease. Barillas
made love like an old time knight, even
if he ba4 recourss to dictionaries and in
terpreters to posh along his causÂ«. At
torney Dimond still declares that the
wbole Blair family fell before the Central
American's effusiveness. He gathered
tbem into the pockets of his capacious
heart, this cay old deceiver, and in their
confidence they forgot to make inquiries
about the wife and family wno awaited
his coming to Central America.
It -was like an oasis in a dreary land,
this coming of Barillas Into tbe lives of
Miss Blair and Uer family, to use Di
mond s metaphor. They were poor and â 
unsophisticated; the Guatemalan rich and I
worldwide. The floodgates of his affec
tion let forth such torrents of friendship
and endearment that even the natural
precautions of a mother for herdaughter's
welfare and good naiqe were laid on tbe j
i shelf. At one fell swoop this doughty
! old breaker of hearts carried every bul
wark, leaving in his wake a trail of broken
hearts, love letters, photographs and
other odds and endl for the law-sharps to
worry over.
The picture Dimond drew yesterday of
thai memorable night in June last, wnen
Barillas pledged his troth for the heart of
Miss Biair, over wine a:-.d flowers in the j
Delmonico restaurant, showed that the '
I suitor had a fine turn for the romantic.
The first foamine beaker had scarcely !
! disappeared when, behold, the general, ]
' rising and reaching across the table for |
\ the nand of his fair companion, lie j
i dramatically exclaimed, "Si si, senorita; j
: all, all aud more. :> To slip on a diamond
I ring was the work of an instant. Ribas
hastened to explain to the woman that
Barillas wished her to be his wife, and
I the citadel of love was successfully
stormed. What young woman of 21
i years of age, born in Oakland, could re
| sist such wooinc as this? was the argu
: ment of Dimond.
The next scene is just as good. Thn
newly won is sent home in a hack, loaded
j with diamonds and flowers, to inform her
i mother and sister of her happiness. The
I following morning the sister and the
faithful Ribas call to secure the parental
consent. Mrs. Blair, however, was not so
' easily deceived as her daughter. She hud
her ideas about people of different nation
alities marrying, and then there was a
discrepancy In the ages, for this love
| scarred veteran was one and fifty. But
i Barllias swept aside such a feeble barrier
! with one slieht effort. He placed love
above everything. Where there was true
love nationality and ace cut no figure. In
his earnestness his well-springs opened
and copious draughts of tears filled his
pleading eyes. The supreme moment had
I arrived, and the mother recalled her
daurhter, who had discreetly retired.
Blushing, she allows Don Juan to lead
her to her mother for the blessing. Kisses
follow all around, for, as in matters of
money, Barillas was generous with his
I osculatory favors. First he clasps his
fiancee to his heart, then the prospective
i mother-in-law and sisters.
"I can only be happier when we are
married," he says, enthusiastically, or,
rather, Ribas does it for him, and joy
serene settles on the household. But
', Barillas has not vet played his last card.
1 To reach the mother's heart he magnani-
m ously asks permission to call her "mam
t , ma," and in return he would be "her son
| Manuel." "Mi so soy muchacho; mi so
j horubre," he adds to Ilibas, who forth- !
I with translates the lover's sentiments in
j this wise: "I am no longer a boy; I am a
! man." Although possibly this entirely '
unnecessary statement is the result of
sheer effusiveness.
And now for the future. Barillas pic- j
â  tured it in radiant colors. There would |
! be an extended honeymoon trip to Eu-- \
â  rope, after which everybody would go to j
! Central America and the family hacienda. !
Miss Liliie must take lessons in Spanish. I
Both she and her sister must proceed to j
"give up their jobs at once" as cashiers in
! cigar-stores, for no scion or relative of the
! haughty Barillas must work for a living.
i The heart and possessions of this cavalier
| were capacious enough to make all happy. i
Miss Blair bad been earning $6 a week, j
but Barillas shuddered at such thoughts
of poverty. Ue orders the faithful Kibes
to give the family unlimited credit, and

j sealskin sack and some few sill; dresses he I
upbraids her for her economy.
"Miss Blair told me she could, have j
spent thousands of dollars," said Dimona.
Some weeks of unalloyed bliss followed.
Barillas was a constant caller at the I
j house and flowers and candy presents !
â  flowed in profusion. His ardor never
waned. For hours he would talk of his |
home : in Central America and draw maps j
of his coffee plantations. He was worth
many millions, out oh! so lonely. He
called Lillie "My life, my sister, my fair j
white flower." The younger Bister
Emily, he asked to be bis "little Bister,"
and showered on her all manner of pet
names in â .' Spanish. -They ' would *, never

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 19, 1897.
Ribas was commissioned to order expen
sive dinners from the Palace Hotel. To
Mrs. Phelps he declared in his enthusiasm
one day that Lillian was ''tbe fairest
flower a man ever had for a bride."
All this was related by Dimond by
means of the introduction of certain type
written document?, which the attorney
said he drew up at the time Miss Blair
j had eneaeed him to prosecute the Guate
malan Dan Juan for breach of promise.
I Copies of these documents, which were
! declared to contain in substance tbe
j stories of Barillas' wooing as the lawyer
I heard it from different members of the
i Biair family.
But there arrived a time when a change
I came over the spirit of the aeed suitor.
| Dinners at the Palace and Delmonico,
I drives to Peralta where Barillas had paid
! for a year's schooling for Miss Blair's
; brother gave way to the final parting, and
then one evil day the lover made his ap
pearance to say good-by. He had re
ceived a telegram from his partner in
Europe which necessitated his immediate
presence in Paris.
Happiness gave way to weeping, for
never a lover, according to Dimond, had a
' more ready command of bis tear valves.
; In his anguish he almost fell down the
I front steps of the Blair residence. But he
i would come back. It was only a matter
' of six weeks or so until he would clasp
i again "his whits flDwer," and $700 was
j left as a sort of surcease with the sorrow
i ing ones behind.
The following day the Guatemalan and
i Ribas left lor Europe. He wrote a letter
', from Port Costa, and almost daily Miss
' Blair received letters or telegrams from
1 him until he arrived in London. Tben it
was she began to pine. Days passed into
weeks and still no word from the recreant.
In December she wired for $1000, but at
| this time Barillas was frolicking about
! Europe with another girl, May Taber.
' Miss Blair sorrowed until advised to seatc
j the services of Dr. E. F. Perrault, who,
on learning the true nature of her malady,
struck her love dream to the ground with
the news that there was a very lively and
estimable lady in Guatemala who pre
! eided over the house and fortunes of
Bnrillas.
Never until that tim* 1 , said Attorney
! Dimond, did he believe Miss Blair knew
of the deception that had been practiced
! upon her. He believed that the whole
j family had been basely wronged and that
! was tbe reason why he entertained a suit
I for breach of promise.
Atlornay Eisner, however, insisted that
Miss Blair bad told him from the begin
ning of her acquaintance she knew Bar
illas was married. Dimond was positive
in the contrary of this. Eisner said it
was remarkable the Central American
'bad never taken the woman he claimed as
fiancee to any public functions. Dimond
saw only in this the craftiness of the
millionaire in providing against poasiole
embarrassments. Barillas had avoided
being seen in the theaters for the reason,
Dimond said, given to Miss Blair that be
did not understand English.
Eisner it strike you that Barillas,
a man of much experience, would not
1 aye wrtten such, letters as be sent to
Miss Bl&ir with any serious intentions?
Attorney Thornton objected to the as
sumption that Barillas was a man of ex
perience}
- Eisnerâ Didn't you realize that these
letters were mere Spanish effusions? ':â 
Because a man comes from a
Spanish country b? cannot be said to be a
Spaniard when he acts as Barillas did.
Attorney Eisner did you think that it
was necessary - to win Miss Blair that
Barillas wrote those letters? â¢'; ;
Ana Attorney Thornton dropped a re
mark that every I man who writes Â» love
letter is more or less of fooJ. : -
It wax to vindicate himself and bis
friends, Drs. Ferrauit and Cranz, Dimond
said,' he had instituted suit to recover
$10,000 for ie.-al services against < Miss
Blair. He learned - that \ she, her sisters
and her mother had made affidavits de
caring he had asked them to enter into
a blackmailing scheme against Barillas,
and he wanted the world 10 Know the in

WANTS A HEAVY CUT.
Supervisors Will Ask That Water Rates
to Householders Be Keduced
20 Per Cent. â ;;-:/';â 
Beveral members of the Board of Super
visoiÃ are somewhat mystified over the
manner In which the water-rate question
is being handled by those who have been
most active in the matter.
Gatherings, dignified ,by being called
meetings of the "water committee"â as a
matter ot fact there is no "water commit
tee"âare held and misleading informa
tion given out as the results.
Several Supervisors have failed to get
invitations to tnese meetings and have
been Kept in the dark as to the course that
is being pursued. The latest "meeting"
was held in Mayor Phelan's office down
town, and ft was given out that a cut of 10
per cent in water rates had been fig
ured on. â 
As a matter of fact, Supervisor Clinton
stated that he would ask that the rates of
householders be cut 20 per cent and that
the rates to business bouses and for irri
tation be materially reduced. He argued
that the increase in volume of business
would bring the company's income up to
within 10 per cent of what it now is and
that the result would be that the divi
dends to stockholders would not be cut
below 5 per cent â  :'â â â  â  ' "â â â ."
This theory is combatted by those in a
position to know the real facts of the mat
ter and the results that would accrue from
so heavy a cut, and it it proposed that no
such reduction will be permitted by the
board, which is plainly disposed to be fair
in the premises. ! . ,
* A meeting will probably be held on
Thursday evening. to discuss the question
of rates. â¢ .'.- _â¢â -_-â¢ . â â -

A HAMMAM NIGHT
AND THE SEQUEL
The Grand Jury Presents
an Indictment Against
Charles J. Whelan.
Witnesses Tell H w E. W. Shaw
Lost $200 in Coin and a
Diamond Ring,
i
Reginald H. Webster, Superintendent
of Schools, Explains the C:st and
Methods of Census Taking.
The Grand Jnry yesterday heard the tes
timony of witnesses regarding the robbery
of E. W. Shaw in the Hammain Baths on
Post street one night about two weeks ago.
According to tne story told to the jury
Shaw, who Keeps a place on Market street,
opposite the Palace Hotel, went to the
baths along with C. J. Wheian, a railroad
broker. The articles of value belonging to
â¢acn were deposited, Shaw receiving a key
to the box containing his diamonds and
money and Whelan a key to a box in
which bis own belongings were stored.
The jury seems to have been convinced
that Whelan went in without anything of
value and came out $300 ahead, while
Shaw went in witn coin and diamonds
and left the establishment without either
cash or jewelry.
The Grand Jury heard the testimony of
M. CÂ»ro, the day clerk, and M. Marks, the
night clerk at the establishment. Mr.
Shaw, the man who lost the money, also
testified. At 4 o'clock ihe jury went into
Juds;e Seawell'a court and presented an
indictment charging Wiielan with grand
larceny. The indictment was place 1 on
tne secret file.
From what can be ascertained regard
ing the testimony submitted to the jury it
does not appear that any witne es testified
directly that Whelan took Shaw's key,
but it is said that VVhelan can be ldenti
n d as the man who got Shaw's money
and diamonds at an early hour in the
morning. Shaw gave instructions to be
railed at 8 o'clock. It was presumed that
Wlielan. who was feigning sleep, ovei
heard the remark and vacated the prem
ises at 6 y'ciqcK in the morning. This
much is positively known, that when
Shaw went for hs valuables at 8 o'clock
they were gone. The case promises to be
quite interesting.
Whelan is said to be well conneclel by
marriage. He was formerly an agent for
ii large commission house and subse
quently a traveler for a wholesale firm in
this City, Of late raonibs he has been on
the railr ia i line as a promoter of business
in the passenger department.
The Grand Jury bad the pleasure of
listening to Reginald H. Webster, Su
perintendent of Schools, on the subject of
the school census recently taken. The
Auditor, it appears, informed the jury
that the demands for the service per
formed by the deputies were excessive.
The cost of the work last, year and the
sum charged for similar work this season
did not differ widely, so fefae jurorÃ were
inclined to the belief that rot a great deal
of public money had been wasted. Some
of the demands indicated more days
charged for than the calendar number of
days from the beginning to the closine ot
the censu?, but this discrepancy was ac
counted for by the allowance of over*
time. For example, eight hours' service
was reckoned as a day's work and when a
deputy worked sixteen hours a day he
presented a demand for two days' work.

KKW VOKK MARKETS.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 18.â Speculation in
stacks to-day was influenced by the character of
the President's message reearJing Cuba and ad
vices abroad indicating a more tractable disposi
tion of toe Porte. A good deal of buying, espe
cially during the first half of the day, was the con
tinuance of the covering mavemeat of yesterday.
In the latter trading operations for the long ac
count were discernible and there was also a dispo
sit on on the part of a portion of the professional
element to bid up prices. The lifting of the
speculative community (ram 'he short to the long
side o: the market was directly traceable, with
which prices advanced, owing to the unusually
small supuly of stocks in night. Chicago Gas
was again the leader la respect 10 activity. tint aid
no score as grea : a net advance as yesterday. St.
Paul and C, B. and Q. were the most prominent
stioug features 01 the market. 'I ho improvement
of the weekly traffic returns of .the nrst named
and the belief that a similar showing will be made
by the latter was largely responsible for the up
ward movement. â 
>ugur refining was comparatively neglected.

YESTERDAY'S WHKAT MARKET.
The following resume of the wheat market is
furnished by E. A. Bresse, Produce Exchange
grain broker, 412 Pine street.
Sax Francisco, May 18, 1897.
Chicago.
Yesterday's weak feeling in Wheat continued
this morning. Liverpool cables reported 3 d
lower at the opening, while French markets were
h seer. Heavy Nor. h western receipts and fine
growing weather discouraged holders, while
shorts with renewed courage pounded the market
hard. July opanei 1 cent lower than yesterday's
close. May at limes was within %d of July; again
the spread would widen to IVsd. , </*Â»Â«
Outside news to-day was generally favorable to
sellers. The desire to short Wheat i> becoming
very fashionable again. Shorts have increased
their lines largely during the past two days. Con
siderable long Wheat came into the market under
71d. Buying around 70y d was by brokers sup
posed to be acting for Armour. The demand for
spot W heat v. as less urgent. Th'.s was used by
shorts to depress the market.
The amount of Wheat reaching tidewater points
Is Increasing rapidly. -
Receipts in the Northwest will, It Is thought,
drop off materially! within a few days. Much
Wheat now being moved from interior elevators
has been sold for export and is now being hurried
forward. Reports from England give crop condi
tions as improving, weather brilliant.
Reports trom France are less assuring. Esti
mates vary as to the shortage in the wheat crop,
conservative authorities claim from thirty to fifty
million bushels, soma going so far as to say one
hundred million. It Is rather early to give an ac
curate idea, yet' it is almost certain France will
need considerable wiieat from America this year.
Tills factor will not be felt for some time to come.
Bushels.
Receipts to-day at primary points 382,995
shipments to-day at primary points 552,920
Receipts to-day at tidewater points 358,711
Exports 146.019
Closing Liverpool cables show a further decline
of %d. French markets at the close had lost the
early advance. Buying by shorts near the close
advanced prices 3/ d over the low point of the day.
CORNâ Some weaker: receipts fairly large;
country offerings increasing. Commission houses
report larger inquiry for spot. Exporters asking
concessions, which sellers are not ready to meet.
Railroads are giving shippers inducements just
now to move corn in order to Keep their equip
ment employed during the dull season.
OATSâ HeId their own regardless of weakness
in other cereals,
PROVISIONSâ Opened weak. Receipts of hogs
in excess of estimates caused a weaker feeling in
hog products. A good demand sprung up soon
after the opening, resulting in advancing prices
some. Trading throughout the session was rather

San Francisco.
9:16 A. m. session.
Lower foreign markets, together with Chicago
showing a decline or %c against yesterday's clos
ing made wheat bulls rather tame this morning.
December wheat opened at *1 27% â¢ I "l advanced
tof 1 27% on good buying. At the advance offer
ings became large and buyers withdrew until prices
were shaded atr fie . At the close $1 27% was bid,
$1 35 asked, for May. Nothing doing In barley.
Between sessions December wheat dropped off
to $1 27 on lower Eastern markets.
10:15 a. m session.
The session was devoid of special features. Fluc
tuations In wheat narrow. Trading was of fair
volume, rather Inclined to lower prices. The con
tinued depression in the Chicago market started a
few longs to selling out. Shorts, who are ever
ready to assist their weakened friends, joined in
contributing their mite
Buying around $ 1 ti7 stopped ' selling of long
wheat. The s'nbbornness shown in resisting bear
attacks Id ibe free of depressed Eastern and Euro
pean markets is remarkable, "ecember barley
opened at 7414 c and closed at 743/ c.
11:15 a. M. session.
Early sellers of wheat lound themselves con
fronted with weather conditions not altogether to
their liking. Hot winds are predicted for to-mor
row over the San Joaquin and Sacramento val
leys. In oraer to get back their wheat the price
was advance! to $127% for December, against
$1 27 at the close of the previous session, offer
ing* were extremely light, as short* had sold all
they cared to.
Buyers were quite In the majority. A prominent
shipper bid $1 2714 for any amount. his same
Shipper just returned from a three days' trip over
the country. , He reported the recent rains as
having done more harm than good; on account of
warm weather inimcii ately following.
'-' f. x. session.
Trailer* who had anticipated an advance in
December wheat to $1 28 at this session :ound the
fee, lug somewhat changed as compared with the
late morning session, sellers were, .0 a limited
extent, in the majority. There seemed to be
plenty of wheat for sale at $1 27% and a reversal
of form at *1 27%. At the latter price there ap
peared no limit to baying orders.
The local market continues to shape prices of its
own, regardless of outside influences. Holders are
disposed to hold on, wni.e shorts are in and can't
get out. it remains to be seen which influence is
the great

Turn Suden Returns From
the Wreck of the
Yacht Regina.
No Trace of the Two Missing
Men Has Rewarded the
Searchers' Efforts.
Had to Bribe Chinese Fishermen to
Induce Them to Return to
the Wreck
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 18. J
The bodies of the two young men
drowned with the wreck of the Regina
Saturday night have not yet been recov
ered, althoueh several parties have been
searching for them.
Henry turn Suden, one of the survivors,
ha? returned home and this morning gave
the foilowing account of the wreck, which
clears up some of the mystery surround
ing it. It also dissipates the insinuation
that has been made that the three sur
vivors leit their two comrades on the
wreck in too much of a hurry.
"When we struck the rocks, "said Mr. t"im
Suden, "we were but a short distance from
the Hen and Chicken Rock that stands
high above the water, and Yaughan told
us to make for Red Rock in the skiff that
â¢was towing astern ot the Regina. The ob
ject was to put two of us a;hore and the
third one to go back after the remaining
two clinging to the yacht. We had such
confidence in Vaughan that we obeyed
him, not, however, without making a pro
test. Once away !rom the wreck the skiff
was at the mercy of the heavy wind and
high sea.
"We tried to make the rock a few rods
off, but vrc were driven ashore. It is a
miracle that we ever reached the shore in
iho heavy sea that was running. We did,
however.'and after landing Hayes and In
galsontbe Chinese junk I started back
tor the remaining men. For two hours I
rowed about in trying to make the yacht.
Before I knew where I was my boat had
drifted past Red Rock. By chance 1 suc
ceeaei in getting bad to the Chinese
â junk, and by much persuasion we induced
the Chinese to take us out to the wreck in
one of their tishinsi-boats.
â â We went around as close to whera we
stppoÃed the yacht to be as was possible
ianJ then Circled around Red Rock. We
saw nothing of the yacht, but it was quite
tiark and we might have been unable to
see -her even had she been in the same
place. Finally, exhausted and sick at
jjea.rt, we were compelled to put back to
shore and spend the night In the Chinese
lisaing-camp. Next morning the yacht
was ashore. Thin some men in a gasoline
launch took Hayes and Ingals to Sausalito,
whence they made their way home.
1 remained at the camp, and visited every
other fishing-camp in the neighborhood,
but none of the Chinese had seen the
miesing men. After examining the rocks
again in a fishing-boat yesterday I walked
10 San Pablo and made my way home."
Commodore Lancaster and ex-Com
modore yon Schmidt of the California
Yacht Club spent a. I of to-day cruising
around in the neighborhood of the
Trreck, but were una Die to discover any
thing.

H. D. Brasefield'a Application to Be
Installed Pastor After Cutting Ex
aminations May Hake Trouble.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 18.â The Oak
land Presbytery has beon called to meet
Thursday eveniDc in the Second Presby
terian Church on Union street. The pur
pose of the special meeting is to consider
the application of that church to have the
Rev. H. D. Brasetield installed as their
pastor.
The meeting promises to result in
another church row. A strong opposition
has already been organized and when the
matter comes up it is possible that Mr.
Krasetield will be refused. The whole
trouble arises from the fact that Mr.
Brasefield has attempted to get ahead of
his position as laid down by the pres
bytery.
"Mr. Brasefield was refused r license to
preach," said the Rev. B. W. Perry,
president of the presbytery, "some time
ago on the ground that he had not the
necessary theological education. He was
recommended to take a two years' course
at the San Anselmo Seminary. Last
spring, just a month before the two years
expired, he applied to the presbytery,
then in session, and was granted a license
to preach. We all thought he would fin
ish his course.
"The presbytery never installs a man as
pastor until he has studied three years,
and, as he has refused to finish his two
years. I do not believe that he will be in
stalled as pastor on Thursday night His
conduct has hurt his standing mate
rially.' 1

MUST ORGANIZE
FOR PROTECTION
Fruit- Growers of Alameda
County Are at a Big
Disadvantage.
Low Prices Prevail Because of
the Entire Absence of
United Efforts.
Must Follow the Example Set by the
Fruit-Growers of Southern
California. ,
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 18. j
A movement Has been started for estab
lishing a vegetable and fruit growers'
union in Alameda County. At the pres
ent time certain branches of vegetable
growing are being rained because of in
judicious competition and owing to a lack
of good judgment in handling the com
mission business.
In the neighborhood of Pleasanton
there are many acres of peas which the
growers are not taking the trouble to pick
because of the low prices. In the city of
Oakland these vegetables' are bringing
good prices, such as would pay for their
growing if they could be got to market
without having to pass through so many
hands. It was for the purpose of doing
away with the middlemen from San
Francisco that the local commission men
have chartered a steamer, and will con
duct their own commission business
directly with the growers along the Sacra
mento River.
The same principle that was found to
be working to a disadvantage in regard to
the produce from river ports needs to be
corrected in regard to the produce grown
in the interior of the county. It is
claimed that all of these matters can be
adjusted by a well-organized Vegetable
and Fruit Growers' Union, such as exists
In every county producing as much as
Alameda.
Some months ago the Livermore League
of Progress took ui> this matter, and at
tempted to create enough interest for the
formation of a produce exchange in this
city. But the matter was allowed to
lapse.
Now that the fruit season has opened,
i and growers realize that they cannot ob
| tain adequate returns for their products,
| the question has been brought forward in
a more energetic manner. A fruit-grower,
who has made the conditions of produce
growing in Alameda County a special
study, has isÂ«ued a lengthy statement
which concludes as follows:
Boards of trade could do no better work than
I go out into the small towns of our State and
1 get them organized and interested in growing
and shipping fruit and produce systemati
: cally. We have had reason to believe that those
I who wish to control Eastern shipments are
' too anxious to keep the grower irnorant of all
the facts in the case if possible, and mole-.
him suffer at times only to teach him a lesson
of dependence. Orange-growers in Southern
California have had their eyes opened to such
things, and San Jose and vicinity are also
awake and organized, and, as a result, all are
better off in those localities.
Those who have cherries to sell this year are
greatly surprised when the canneries send out
their buyers, as they have in the past week,
> and offer only 1 to s cents a pound for that fruit.
It is simply outrageous. Had there been a big
yield, as was anticipated, such prices would
have been snmll enough, but with the limited
supply In almost every part of the State, and
especially here in Alameda County, the home
I of the cherry, the price is far too low. Many
| of the growers expect to ship East, but, as we
I have said, this is done by only a few of the
' large orchardists, and that through some one
| else, with one or two exception*.
So far as being organized is concerned, and
! all shipping systematically, there is nothing
j of that done in Alameda County. Telegraph
I reports tell us that Vacaville, Newcastle and
San Jose have shipped cherries already this
year and received on an average $1 74 a box,
or a little over sixteen cents a pound. The
price that has been offered by the canneries
may have something to do with getting the
united effort of growers in this county to
gether. ______________
TO CAMP IN BOHEMIA.
Second Regiment, Boys' B r igade,
Will Pitch Tents for E ght
Days
An Auxiliary Camp Will Be Provided
for the Friends Who Will Accom
paDy the Regiment.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 18.â The Boys'
Brigade, Second California Regiment, has
decided to camp this year at Bohemia, on
the Russian River. At the regular meet
ing the most important thing under dis
cussion was the coming camn. It had
been decided some months aeo that the
regiment should go to^Snnol, but the feel
ing among the boys seemed to be against
Sunol and strongly in favor of Bohemia,
on the Russian River.
The regiment camped there last year
and was treated so well by the authorities
and by the railroad that Bohemia will
acain be the camping ground of the Second
California Regiment.
It was decided that the regiment go
into camp for eight days, commencing on
June 16. Much interest is being shown,
and from appearances double tbs number
taken last year will go with the regi
ment.
The auxiliary camp will be situated
near the rmli'ary camp and will be run on
the same style as last year.
The guard duty for the boys will not be
so burdensome this year, as it is being
arranged to not give more than twenty
four hours' duty to any one boy during
the entire eight days.
The regiment also decided to accept the
invitation of the Decoration day commit
tee and parade on that day. Orders will
be issued to turn out the entire regiment
and make as tine showing as possible.
The following appointments have been
made by Colonel A. W. Taylor:

NO MORE SICK TEACHERS
Berkeley's Board of Education
Makes a Startling Edict
Regarding Health.
No Dyspeptics or Consumptives Need
Apply for Positions in the
College Town.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 18.â A peculiar
state of affairs exists ;n the Berkeley
School Department as a result of the ukase
sent forth by the Board of Education last
night. They sent forth the proclamation
that no dyspeptic! need apply for posi
tions in the department. They decided
that in future one of the qualifications for
a position as teacher in the schools of the
university town must be in good health.
Dyspepsia was especially tabooed by
Director Robertson, who maintained that
persons troubled with chronic indigestion
were not capable of maintaining a proper
equability of temper.
'The same," said he, "is true of any
nervous diseases. I pre3iime that if we
required a certificate of health it would
cause a terrible howl, as the vaccination
law did, but it would certainly be just as
good a thing."
The proposed new requirement for
tefichers wÂ«Â« first suggested in the annual
report of President Boone, who declared
that unhealthy teachers might be a
sonrce of danger to pupils.
The matter was disposed of last night
by the adoption of a report offered by Di
rector Crew in which it was provided that
every applicant for a position as teacher
in Berkeley must be rea ly at least to
make an affirmation that be or she is free
from organic diseases, such as consump
tion or dyspepsia.
The new law will go into effect at once,
and if there be any dyspeptics or con
sumptives among the teachers of the
Berkeley public schools they nrein danger
of having their official heads lopped off
when the time for the election of teachers
comes around again.

More attention at the pifesent time is
being given by investors and home-seek
ers to outside property, such as can be
had without the inconvenience of saving
for the greater part of a lifetime.
The idea of owning a home is becoming
more fixed in the minds of people of mod
erate incomes, and to that end the cheaper
lands, witn the added inducements of
time and easy payments, are being
sought. The outlying districts show by
the number of dwellings going up that ad
vantage is being taken of the low prices of
land and also of the cheapening of all
building materials.
In the building line considerable activ
ity is noticeable, both in large and small
work. The new work being started
ii, however, mostly in the line of small
and medium-sized dwellings and flats.
The more xapialy City real estate ad
vances in value the more room there is
supposed to be for general congratula
tion. Nevertheless there are many sad
features connected with rapid increase of
real estate values in large cities. Such
advances fall with grinding weight on
tbe poor, not only rendering it impossible
for them to own a home of their own, but
in very many cases placing even a decent
premises for rent beyond their means.
This is one of the chief reasons, if
not the strongest, why all those with small
means In a crowing city should make every
effort for the acquisition of a homestead be
f >re land within ti reasonable distance of tbe
City tenter has advanced to a price that ren
ders the purchase of a home impossible to
those in poor circumstances.
San Francisco is peculiarly situated fromja
real estate standpoint. To prophesy how
cities will grow which are situated in the
middle of a great plain, like Denver, or even
on the shore of the great lake, like Chicago, is
not an easy task. One cannot tell which way
the growth may extendâ north or south, east
or west. In such cases speculation may re
sult most disastrously. The wisest heads are
sometimes wrong in iheir prophecies of the
direction of a city's growth.
In the case of San Francisco, however, there
is no room for error. One cannot guess
wrongly as to the direction of its growth. As
its business increases, as it grows in impor
tance as a commercial center and as its rail
roads mu'tuiy, so will San Francisco, tbe
great maritime and commercial city of the
Pacific Coast, increase and completely occupy
the peninsula on wnich it is situated.
No city in the world is Â»o advantageously
situated to build ud an immense and far-reach
ing foreign trade. No other city is near at
hand to compete with it. Tbere is no harbor
on the shore of California where a city can be
built which will compare commercially with
San Francisco. Through this harbor must
pass into the United States the merchandise
and producs of all the states and nations to
the west, to the north and to the south, and
through it must pass to these In return the
wealth of California and its sister States.
One of the most important anction sales of
downtotrn property since the sale of the Byer
estate property about two years apo will be
tho offering to-morrow by Baldwin & Howell
of the southeast corner of Powell and Ellis
streets. The property in question is to be sold
by order of the Probate Court. The improve
ments on the land consist of a four-story brick
building. It is not often that such a choice
piece oi income property finds its way Into the
auction-rooms, and when it does bidden are
seldom found lacking.

Raided a Chinese Resort.
Wong Sam's resort at 829 Washington street
was raided last evening by Miss Culbertson
and a corps of assistants from the Chinese
Prssbyterian mission. One of the inmates of
the house, it is said, is a mere girl, and Miss
Culbertson wished to gain possession of her,
but when the party arrived It was found that
all the inmates were visiting the Chinese
Theater. The chase was given up and the
I arty returned to the mission to await a more
favorable opportunity.

MEETING OF THE CITIZENS'
COMMITTEE.
Major Winchell Has Prepared a Com
prehensive Report of the Pro
posed Scheme-
While those at Washington and in this
City who are opposing the obrogation of
the Hawaiian treaty, are devoting their
time to arguments and petitions pro
COLONEL HOLLAND, Social Secretary of the Salvation Army.
vided by interested persons, Claus Spreck
els is demonstrating by his acts that ab
rogation will De to the greatest advantage
to the general welfare of the State.
Not the least good that will follow as
the result of the discontinuance of the ex
isting convention will be the solution of
the question of the surplus labor of this
City and the commonwealth at large. He
stands ready to enter heart and soul into
the colonization scheme of the Salvation
Army and will co-operate to the axtent of
providing lands, money and the benefit of
his valuable exoerience in the work of
furnishing permanent means of livelihood
for the unemployed. All he asKs is that
there be a sullicient guarantee that the
men will be industrious.
Claus Bpreckels was brought promi
nently into the situation at a meeting
yesterday of the committee appointed at
the Chamber of Commerce meeting about
two months ago to consider the problem
of the unemployed. This committee com
prises ex-Mayor Ellert, George H. Max
well, George S. Montgomery, George E.
Butler, and Major W. W. Winchell of the
Salvation Army.
The main work of the committee was
understood to be to devise ways and
means to carry out the colonization
scheme for unemployed suggested by
Commander Booth-Tucker. This com
mittee ha 3 heretofore deferred action, as
tue boulevard project temporarily re
lieved the situation, and it was not
thought advisable to interfere with that
matter as it afforded the readiest way out

even organization of the committee was
effected. ,
Colonization schemed were discussed,
but soon the entire committee was ab
sorbed in the sugar-Deei industry and the
feasibility of establishing colonies of un
employed on lands suitable for the raising
of the saccharine bulb.
Butler, who is a stockholder in tne Ala
meda Suear Company, strongly advocated
the idea and suggested that some of the
committee wait upon Claus Spreckel? and
also on James Coffin, the latter being in
terested in the AUnieda beet-sugar fac
tory. Before the meeting adjourned
Major Winchell ana ex-Mayor Ellert were
empowered to rail on Claus Spreckels to
day and get his views on the proposition.
When the mauer was brought lo the
attention of the man who has so success
fully inaugurated and established the
t>eet-Â«ui;ar industry in California his face
beamed with the anticipated pleasure of
being able to be of assistance in solving la
a most satisfactory wav a troublesome
social and industrial problem.
"I shall be most happy to do pverything
I can to aid this project,* 1 said the sugar
king. "Tne idea is certainly a good one
for many reasons. Ail that I shall ask on
my part i* that the men be industrious.
I:" they prove to be so they will have no
difficulty in not only msking a living, but
in acquiring a competence and even be
coming the owners of homes. The oppor
tunities exist, and it will remain with the
men themselves to use them properly.
"Men who are willing to work on farms
is what this Slate needs, and there is no
better fie il than in the raising of sugar
beets. There are now more than a hun
dred families who were installed on lands
which I owned. I provided them with
shelter a:id had my men instruct them in
their work. They are now ail in a fair
way to shortly own their own farms, for
the profits are very large.
"When the sugar fac'ory near Salinas
ia complete! next, year we will be able to
utilize the product of 40,000 acres of land,
while there are now not more than 12,000
acres crown to beets in that section of
the State. When it is understood thai
sugar-beet farming gives employment to
forty men where grain-growing furnishes
work to only one man, the people will
comprehend the importance of encourag
ing the industry in every po-sible way.
"It is because I realize the importance
of this question to our laboring classes
that 1 am opposed ;o the Hawaiian
treaty. In Hawaii the laborers on the
sugar plantations earn $12 a month, while
in California none get less than $2 a day
â 
1 or $52 a month, and the money is kept in
this State."
"What would be your plan for colonizing
the unemployed on beei-sugar land?" was
a-ked.
"I nave about completed negotiations
for 600 acres of fine beet land. This lam
willing to rent or sell on easy terms to
parties of colonists, and I will make it my
business to see that they receive proper
instructions in the practicable wont of
raising beets. Further I will make con
tracts with them to buy all the beets they
raise for $4 a ton.
"Then there is another large tract of
about 6000 acres, for which I have espe
cially imported a steam plow which turns
over the soil to a depth of seventeen
inches. This land has a top layer of
adobe, which is very hard â almost impos
sible â to work with an ordinary plow and
horses. With the steam plow we will go
beneath the adobe to the sedimentary soil
below and work the two togetner. It will
then make the best kind of land for sugar
beets. The work of plowing this up wili
be commenced shortly, and as fast as it is
brought into condition it will also be
placed at the service of those who are at
the head of this colonization scheme, if
they want it.
"I want to say that all this land is pecu
liarly adapted to sugar - beet growing.
Were it not I would not have bought it.
It will average from fifteen to twenty
tons of beets to the acre."
In conclusion Mr. Spreckels senten
liously remarked : "If the men are in
dustrious they will make money: if they
are not, they, should be made to give
place to others."
In connection with the Salvation Army
colonization scheme to secure rural homes
for the unemployed Maior Wincnell has
prepared a comprehensive report of what
it should be and what it is hoped to ac
complish by it.
The idea is to acquire public and private
lands for the surplus population of the
State, who may by their industry applied
to such lands gain a livelihood, and in
time their own Homes. Similar work in
England, India and Australia, it is
claimed, resulted in the most abandoned
city characters becoming contented set
tlers of the soil. It is hoped that three
fourths of ail the unemployed will avail
tuemselves of tne opportunity to ac
quire a home in thÂ« country, and that
many who are now earning small wages
will also be induced to change urban for
j suburban employment which promises
luture independence.
Should the first colony prove a success
it is believed many capitalists will be in
fluenced to invest niouev in settling what
are aow idle and unprofitable lands in the
State, and will do away with "the humil
iating system of temporary relief." There
would be no excuse for any one begging.
Major Wiuchall states in his report that
he has been offered 300,000 acres' of land
since the visit of Commander Booth-
Tucker. Among the more desirable lands
he mentions those of the Walker estate in
Sonoma County, the Cotate ranch and tht
Kenwood property in the same county,
: and some of the lands of the Cremelita
Vineyard Company of Fresno County.
It is proposed to limit the holding of
each settler to not more man ten acres, as
it is believed this area can bs worked to
the best advantage by one person. Forty
acres will bÂ« reserved for army head
quarters. Ten acres will be used for build
ings, and tbirty acres for stock and train
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 19, 1897.
ing purposes. The proposed headquarters
are described in detail as follows:
On the ten acres would be erected the cen
tral headquarters and office, with a bank to
facilitate the interchange of products, and an
experienced accountant to keep account and
report to the headquarters in San Francisco
and Now York. Here the governor or super
intendent of the colony would have his office.
He would have the general oversight of the
entire colony. This headquarters building
could be subdivided into offices for the agri
cultural teacher, or director, and other as
sistants in general. There would also be a
large store for the interchange of products,
also a blacksmith-shop, packing-house, barber
shop, factory, dairy, and a large incubator,
under the direction of an experienced lowl
breeder, who would look alter this eulire
branch throughout the colony. There would
be a building for a public hall and club
rooms for the development of the social in
terests of the colonists, also a schoolhouse,
undÂ»r competent teachers, who would teach
recording to the State laws covering public
instruction.
Detailed descriptions are given of the
provision to be made for each colonist at
the start, the method of discipline to be
adopted, how products are to be ex
changed, how irrigation is to be accom
plished, how coloniets are to be encour
aged to put forih their best efforts, and
how other industries are to- bs developed
in addition to agricultural pursuits.
In discussing the financial nhase of the
project Major Winchell expresses the
opinion that |25,000 will be necessary to
launch the scheme and that it ccn be
secured either by popular subscription or
as a loan at a low rate of interest.
He suggests that a big public meeting
be held in this City to discuss the matter,
and that it be presided over by either the
Mayor or the Governor; also that similar
meetings be he!d in other cities, and that
the press of the State be asked to take
hold of the matter.
Colonel Holland of New York City,
who is the National secretary of the social
branch of the Salvation Army, and who
has been detailed by Booth-Tucker to
visit the Pacific Coast in the interest of
the colonization movement, is expected to
arrive here to-morrow mornine. He will
speak here Friday, and be given a public
reception by his friends.
JORDAN TO BE INVITED.
Mission Park Association Pro
poses to Educate the
People.
Ssries of Public Meetings Proj cted
in the Interest of a Zoological
Collection.
The weekly meeting of the Mission ParK
Association was held at Center & Spader's
real estate office on Montgomery street
yesterday afternoon, George D. Shadburne
in the chair.
T. V. O'Brien, chairman of the commit
tee on distribution of circulars and signa
tures to petition, reported that there had
been circulars issued to all parts of the
City setting forth the part idea, and in
conformity with this scheme he believed
there had been as many as 2000 names ap
pended already favoring the zoological
collection with the greater park under
taking.
The committee on memorial asked for
further time m which to get iis ideas
properly before the people. This was
granted.
George Center suggested that public
meetings be held all over the City, but
particular. y in the Mission, at which
the plans of the association would be
properly placed before the people.
C. C. Bemis suggested that a memorial
be prepared at once and laid before the
Supervisors asking for an appropriation
for a tract of land of not lets than 100
acres. This, he thought, would effectually
shut out the cemetery advocates.
Colonel John O'Byrne suggested that
Professor Jordan of Stanford University
should be invited to deliver a lecture on
the zoological feature of the park. This
idea met with universal approval as being
just the right thing as an educational
leature of t< c project.
W. L. Williamson suggested that an
appropriation be asked for at once.
A. B. Maguire suggested that there be
three public meetings arranged for in the
Mission district. He considered that such
a movement would fully and fairly bring
the question before the puolic. and at one
of thost â the first â Dr. Jordan be invited
to speak.
Colonel O'Byrne moved that the secre
tary he instructed to communicate with
Professor Jordan, inviting him to give a
lecture. This motion was carried, but was
afterward amended by having a sub-com
mittee appointed, consisting of G. D.
Shadburne, Dr. C. G. Kenyon, T. V.
O'Brien, Colonel John O'Byrne, George
Center and Secretary McEwen. This body
will arrange for a meeting with the man
of learning from Palo Alto and make suit
able arrangements for his meeting in case
he consents to deliver a lecture.
The committee of nine as originally ap
pointed was given full power to make all
suitable arrangements for public meetings.
IN THE HOME OF PEACE

half-mast when the cortege started for
San Francisco. It arrived about 11 o'clock
and proceeded to the Home 01 Peace
Cemetery.
Worthy Waster A. A. Dickie, assisted
by about fifty fellow-members of his
lodge, conducted the ceremonies at the
grave. Rev. Dr. Voorsanjjer of the Tem
ple Â£manu-Â£i, of which congregation
j Mr. Diukoisplel had been a member since
its formation, delivered an eloquent
eulogy and was followed in a touching
address by A. F. Hitchcock, grand chap
lain of Suisun Lodge No. 78, I. O. O. F.,
of which Mr. Dinkelspiel was a member.
The faculty of the State Normal School

There was a large attendance from Sui
sun and this City. The floral tributes
were many and beautiful, and in ail re
spects the last ceremonies over the re
mains of this distinguished citizen were
peculiarly solemn and worthy of the
occasion.
Quo Warranto Kefused.

SOME MAY DELIGHT

But the Dogs at the Pa
vilion Are Docile and
Bright.
The San Francisco Kennel Club's
Stow Will Open This Fore
noon.
Judging Will Cemm nee Immediately
After the Big Bsil in the
Raf'ers Sounds.
,
The San Francisco Kennel Club will
open the doors of Mechanics' Pavilion at
10 o'clock to-day for those who desire to
see dogs of divers colors, divers pedigrees,
divers tongues and divers sizes and
weights.
It will be the inaugural bench show of a
ciub which was organized only a few
months ago for the sole purpose of giving
bench shows, particular attention also to
the breeding and care of dogs that are
worth looking after.
The Pavilion looks decidedly pretty in
its doggy dress, with its long tiers of wire
benching, whicn, by the way, are new to
the local fanciers who have not had an
opportunity of seeing how the dogs are
cared for in New York, Chicago and other
large Eastern cities, where the patent sys
tem of benching i? all the go.
The officers of the San Francisco Kennel
Club are sanguine of the financial success
of the show. They have certainly worked
hard in its interests and there is hardly
any doubt ttiat the ladies and gentlemen
who love to fondle a handsome dog will
turn out en masse to see the big "bow
wows" and the little "snariers," which
kick up more fuss and disturbance than a
regiment of St. Bernards. But the little
dogs are just too cute for anything. At
lea^t the ladies say so and, of course, what
they say will be acquiesced in by the
greatest of ali animals â man.
E. M. Oldham, who will pass judgment
on St. Bernards, mastiffs, collies, cocker
spaniels, field spaniels, clumber upaniels,
bulldogs, pugs and Yorkshire terriers, ar
rived from the East last Sunday evening,
and was given a royal welcome by the
club. He is very much pleased with the
outlook, and predicts a flattering success
for the club's initial attempt at bench
showing.
Major J. M. Taylor was almost smoth
ered in mud last Sunday when driving in
from the Cliff House in the company of
J. G. Barker, wno insisted that Mr. Tay
lor should have a peep at sutro's barking
sea lions before he had an opportunity of
passing tiis bands over the big dogs ttiat
will come under his notice to-day. The
major will judge Groat Danes, grey
hounds, foxhounds, deerhounds, blood
hounds, Russian wolihounds, pointers, all
the setters, Chesapeakes, bull terriers,
Newfoundlands and Dachshundes.
G. L. Waring will decide the fox-terrier
dispute, and J. Otis Fellows will judge
the balance of the classes.
Among the large entry of dogs there are
many, yes, very many, beautiful cenines
which will catch the eye of the fancy.
Queen is a pretty animal of nigh blood. |
She is by Donald-Lady Spec; Donald by
Rush T-Patty Croxteib. Queen won first
in novice class, also best pointer bitch in
show and other specials at Sacramento in
January last. She is owned by George
Neale of Sacramento.
The Great Dane dog Jupiter is the prop
erty of Don Ross of Sacramento and is
valued at $1000. He was brod by Lovdal
brothers of Sacramento County, Cal. His
pedigree speaks for itself:

The opening day ot the bench show of
the San Francis-co Kennel Club is'to have
a Bpecial attraction, in which dainty little
Edna Wallace Hopper and her Boston
terrier, Consul, will be the star per
formers.
Yesterday the little lady sent a mesiage
to the directors of the club, asking that
her dog be judged to-day at 2 p. m., as she
intends leaving town bhortly. In case
her desire was granted she volunteered to
lead the canine prodigy into the presence
of the judges herself. The courtesy will
be extended her without doubt.
The dog is of a rare breed and will have
but two competitors at the show. He
took a special prize at the bench show in
New York, and Mrs. Hopper forthwith
fell so deeply in love with his dogship
that she went down deep into her pocket
and fished op the sum of $1500 to have
him all for her own.
The pavilion is now in shipshape and
ready for the performance lo begin â weli
bred dogs, trick dogs, clown and all.
They are all expected to be in by 10 a. m.,
and the judging will begin as pear 11
o'clock as possible. Two rings have been
arranged. Major J. W. Taylor will wield
the scepter in one and E. M. Oldham be
monarch of ail he surveys inside the
rails in another.
The partitions in which the dogi ex
hibited are to be placed are made of wire
netting. They were imported especially
for the occasion, and a certain amount
was guaranteed before they could be had
at all. The club Has been trying to obtain
them for three years, and at last success
has crowned its efforts. The advantage
of the new system of benching is that
people in the east end of the hall cÂ»n see
the dogs all along the linr. It is also
more conducive to cleanliness.
Eighteen trick dogs have been secured
to perform between the hours of judging
in order to wnile away the monolony of
waiting. In addition the prize-winnerÂ»
for each day will be paraded every even
ing.
There are nine dinner parties slated for
to-morrow night among the local four
hundred, at the end of which the respec
tive guests of each host will adjourn lo
the Pavilion to see the show. The hosts
on these occasions will be Mr. and Mrs.
H. J. Crocker, Mrs. William Heger, Mr.
and Mrs. J. Downey Harvey, Mrs. Clark
Crocker, Miss Jennie Blair, Mias Van
Ness, Robert Bolton, T. 'C. Grant and
George Lent.
THE PHffiNIX CLUB.
Final Arrangements Made for the Pic
nic to San Jose Next Sunday.
The Phoenix Republican Club held its
monthly meeting in Scottish Hall last
night and it was marked with the greatest
enthusiasm. In the absence of the presi
dent, Colonel T. V. Eddy, the vice-presi
dent, Sylvester Shaben, occupied the chair
and ; - Andy . Branch, the secretary, was in
his accustomed place. -
; Over 500 members out of the total mem
bership of 1100 were present, and it looked
as if the victory of the last campaign had
lost none of its charm. ' ,
The meeting was held more particularly
to discuss the final details of the club pic
nic to be held at San Jose next Sunday
and to prepare a list of entertainments for
the members and the guests on that oc
casion. vj-%r?r - :l: : : ': ' '
The best possible arrangements to in
sure good order and a good time were re
ported by the executive committee, who
have been untiring in their efforts to see
that the club picnic will be one that will
be long remembered with pleasure and
profit by those participating in it, and be
free from the stigma with which so many
similar affairs are generally branded.
The trains will leave Third and Town
send streets at 9:15 Sunday morning and
Twenty-sixth and .Valencia streets a few
minutes later, leaving San Jose on the re
turn trip about 6 p. m.
FIGHT WITH A POLICEMAN
A Crowd of Men on Carolina
Street Attempt to Rescue
Two Prisoners.
The Officer Had to Use His Club and
Threaten Them With His
Revolver. ,
James S. Varni, a vegetable gardener on
the Mission road, between the Five aDd
Six mile houses, reported to the Seven
teenth-street police station yesterday aft
ernoon that while he was driving
along Carolina street two men jumped
into his wagon and attempted to rob him
of between $35 and $40 that he had in his
pocket.
Lieutenant Burke sent Policeman T. J.
Connell with Varni to see if he could find
the two men. When they got to Carolina
street Varni pointed out Charles J. Smith
and Robert Walner as the men. .
Connell attempted to arrest them and
they showed fight. He drew his club and
a tap on the head laid Smith on the
ground. He managed to get the hand
cuffs on Walner, but several of Walner's
friends came to his rescue, one of them
with an iron bar in his hand. It looked
bad for the officer, and he drew his revol
ver and threatened to shoot if they inter
fered with him.
They made a combined rush upon him,
and in the struggle Walner got away with
the handuffs dangling at his wrists. Con
nell pursued and overtook him. and as he
threatened to perforate the first man who
came near Mm, and looked as if he meant
it, the crowd held back.
| Smith's brother was the only one in the
crowd that helped the policeman, and
with his assistance he was able to take
both his prisoners to the Seventeenth
street station in Varni's wagon.
When Varni got to the station he backed
down from his former statement and
would not say that the men attempted to
rob him,, so they were each charged with
battery, and. an additional charge was
booked against Smith 'for battery upon
the policeman.

SUBSTANTIAL ALIMONY.
Angus McKay Compelled to Pay SlO9
a Month for the Support of
His Children.
Angus McKay mjust pay $100 a month
alimony to his divorced wife Emma Mc-
Kay for the support and education of
their two minor cnildren. Judge Hunt
made that order yesterday.
This litigation has many novel features
and was bitterly taught Irom start to
finish by Attorney E. P. Cole on behalf of
Mrs. McKay and resisted with great per
sistency by Attorney W. S. Goodfellow,
who represented the husband.
In 1884 Mrs. McKay secured a divorce
and was awarded the custody of the minor
children. Botn were poor and she did
I not think it worth while to ask fur ali
mony. Five years iater her ex-husband
began to show signs of prosperity and she
thougt t he ought to help her support
tneir offspring. He agreed to contribute
$20 a month, but made only one payment
ot $10.
Mr. McKay fell heir to $100,000 in
March, ISU4, and Mrs. McKay sought to
have ttie allowance increased, so the case
was reopened in order to have that ooint
considered. After a long trial Judge
Hunt decided that the lady is entitled to
the relief demanded, and gave her judg
ment for $3750 for the past 37}^ months
and ordered that Mr. McKay snail con
tribute $100 a month hereafter until the
cuildren attain their majority.
IT IS GOOD TUBERCULIN.
Dr. Morse Telegraph* the Board of
Health Regarding the Delayed
Killing of Cows.
Dr. Morse of the Board of Health, who
recently went East on a combined pleas
ure ami business trip, has telegraphed the
secretary of the board from Washington
that the tuberculin now in the possession
of the local health authorities is all right,
and that condemnation of cows made
after tests with it should stand. The wire
was sent after a consultation with the
Washington authorities.
I Some time ago, before Dr. Morse started
on his tour, a question was raised whether
or not the ape of tha tuberculin which
bad been sent out from Washington
would militate against its giving correct
results when applied to cows suspected of
being tuberculous. The killing of the
condemned cows was deferred on this ac
count.
Dr. Morse's telewram sots the matter at
rest. In his message he stated that a let
ter to Veterinary Surgeon O'Rourke, giv
ing instruction regarding tne destroying
of the cows, would follow.

HEALTH CONFERENCE.
Oakland and San Francisco Authorities
Discuss Impure Food and Its
Suppression.
A conference of the health authorities
of Alameda County and San Francisco
was held yesterday in the Health Office,
those present being: Dr. J. P. Dunne,
Health Officer of Oakland; Dr. Ryfkogel of
the Oakland Board of Health ; Dr. F. E.

L | J?|f \V ' ' \ are traceable directly
; ~~~~*^^ w^ %Â£ to impurities in the
blood, and can Â«be cured by eliminating
these â  impurities. That most dreadful of
all diseases, consumption, is a disease of '
the blood. , The disease shows in the lungs
because of some inherited or acquired weak-
ness there. If the blood were always pure,
and without germs, the disease would never
develop and in time weakness itself would
be overcome. Germs and impurities in the
blood float along | through the J body until
they find a weak spot for lodgement They
stick there and develop and people call the ,
. disease by the name of the organ afflicted.
As a matter of fact, the disease is always a'
disease of the blood, and if the blood, be
; purified, the disease will be cured, r That is
la perfectly natural, rational conclusion, en-
dorsed .'both $by ; common ' sense and â ; the
highest medical authority. It is in accord-
ance with ; these - facts % that ; Dr. Pierce s
Golden ' Medical Discovery works. The i
i first thing it does is to put the whole diges-
: tive I system ; into perfect order. It stimu-
lates the appetite, excites the copious secre-
tion -of the digestive I fluids and promotes
assimilation. It searches out disease germs
.wherever they may be, kills them and forces
them out of the system. The ' ' Golden '
Medical J Discovery" has been ' used with
unvarying success for over 30 years.
