Proposed Bill to Fix the

The So-Called Scandal at the Capitol
May Result in a Restrictive
Enactment.
SACRAMENTO. Cat,., Jan. 17.â This
was the dullest Sunday noted in legisla
tive circles since the session opened. Few
members were lefi in town, and moat of
them were of the stay-at-home kind.
The so-called legislative scandal will be
settled to-morrow by the report of the
Committee on Attaches and Employes in
the A&Eembly. The committee i* expected
to report exonerating Chief Clerk Duck
worth from all blame and presenting a
bill restricting the number of employes
that n.ay be appointed on organization.
From a statement made to-night by Mr.
Duckworth it appears that a general mis
understanding exists concerning the mat
ter of the organization of the Assembly.
In the first place, the clerk says that the
attaches appointed by him at the request
of nearly ail the members were appointed
to serve during the organization only.
The Assembly completed its organization
in one day, and at the close of that day
the term of the employes on the tempo
rary rollcall came to an end. They were
no longer attaches or employes of the
Assembly.
Their compensation amounted to $620,
but on the next day the Assembly voted
them an allowance for one week. Tne
Vote was unanimous. This action ran the
bill up to something more that $4000. The
payroll was certified to as correct by
Speaker Coombs, and upon that the Con
troller drew the warrants.
Wesley Dixon, whose name appears on
the roll, was not in Sacramento at all.
The chief clerk explained this by saying
that Mr. Dixon was a total stranger to
him. He had never seen him, but had
appointed him on the recommendation of
a -member from Alameda. The person
who had secured D:xon's appointment
failed to notify him. Dixon did not come
to .Sacramento and the warrant forhispay
was never cashed, but remains in the
Ti-.. iiaprf ?.rs,
lurtner, irom Mr. Duckworth's statement
tnat nearly ailtue A?semblynien requested
him to appoint friends on the temporary
roll, and these Assemblymen did not
think that they were eighty in number,
and that if each of them nut a man on the
roll there would be eighty employes draw
ing pay for services which could be per
formed by ten.
â¢'I have placed men on the temporary
roll at the request of Democrats," said
Mr. Duckworth, "and nobody has made
any complaint except Shanahan and Dry
den."
The foregoing statement of the chief
clerk makes it plain that the system un
der which the legislature has been organ
ized is so loose as not to deserve the name
of system at all. It is clear that the first
work of the Legislature should be to make
it impossible, by the passage of the neces
sary bill, for such a thing to occur again.
It is not the tirst time that it has occurred.
The temptation to give hungry camp
followers a job tor a week was too strong.
Tbe town was full oi them from all parts of
the State, and when an Assemblyman was
indebted in the same rleeree for political
favor.-! to two of his constituents and could
appoint only one to a clerksbip. he settled
the matter by having Mr. DutKwoth place
the other on tne temporary list. Thus
hi? political obligation was paid out of the
contingent fund of the Assembly.
The number of men nece-sary for the
purposes of the organisation oi the Legis
lature is as well known as the hour and
the minute on which toe sun will rise to
morrow, and it would be tne easiest thing
in the world to pass a law fixing the num
ber of temporary attache?. Then the As
semblyman who had promised the same
job to two men would have to face the
muMc and ray the tiddler.
The Democrats in ihe Senate have not
improved since the party received such a
â¢ ira-<tnng at the hands of the people in
the last campaign, ana placed themselves
on record in the iirst weetc of the session
as opposed to the protection of the pro
ducer* and laborer? of this Slate from the
Tuinous competition of cheap foreign
labor. It is almost unthinkable that
Americans should object to the shutiing
out of foreign competition which has
closed fo muny factories in the Kasr, and
it is unthinkable that Californmns should
vole aeain?t n resolution protecting the
industries of this SUitf from competition
with European ami Asiatic product?. Yet
this is what the Democratic beaatore did
The Morning Call.
Father Time Not Pleased With Scenes at the Golden Eagle Hotel, Sacramento*
on the first Thursday of the session. Here
is the record :
Senator Smith offered the following
resolution and moved its adoption :
Whkreas, The Committee on Ways and
Means of the House of Representatives is now
engaged In revising the tariff laws of the coun
try for the purpose of providing sufficient rev
| enues to meet the needs of the Government.
; as well as to afford protection to American mi
i dustries; and, whereas, the agricultural, nar
i ticullursl, pastoral, mining and manufactur
ing industries of California are vitally inter
i ested in receiving protection from the
j competition of foreign products; therefore beit
Sesolred, By the Senate of the S;ate of Cali
fornia, that we instruct our Senators and
request our Representatives in Congress to
I use their utmost endeavors to secure for our
I various industries the iull vieasure oi proÂ«Â«r
: lion which, they deserve, to the and mat me j
{ producers and laborers of this State may be i
â¢ shielded from the ruinous competition of
cheap foreign labor.
Whereas, California is but one State in this
: indissoluble union of forty- five States; and,
whereas, all laws of Congress should be equit
| able and fair to all the people ; therefore oe it
Retolved, That we cheerfully request for the
laborers on the farms and in the mines aud
| workshops of other States the same measure of
j protection which we ask lor those of Califor
nia.
The question recurring on the adoption
of the original resolution, the roll was
called and the resolution adopted by the
following vote:
Ayesâ Senators Androus, Aram, Beard, Bert,
Bulla, Denison, Dickinson, Flint, Francfc, Gil
lette. Gleaves, Holloway, Jones, Laneford,
Linder, Luchsinger, Mahoney, Morehouse,
Pedlar, Shine, Shlppee, s-impson, Smith, t-trat

28.
Noesâ Senators Braunhart, Chapman, Doty.
Dwyer, Feeney, Hall, Henderson, LaÃue.l'risk,
Seawell ana Tonerâ ll.
Every one of these except one (Lang
ford) voting to protect California labor
and California products was a Republican.
Every man voting in favor of European
manufacturers and laborers was a Demo
crat. How do the woolmen, the me
chanics and the fruit-growers feel who
voted to elect the Democratic Senators?

A Diy of R-st.
CANTON, Ohio, Jan. IV.â Tbe usual
quiet of Sunday at the McKinley home
was undisturbed to-day. Cabinet-making
ceased, the Major's study was deserted,
the litter of papers had disappeared and
the Presiden t-elect rested and went to
cburct.
Webb Hayes, a son of the late President,
dined with Mr. and Mrs. McKinley and
took a drive with them in the afternoon,
returning home an early evening train.
Now that Senator Sherman has accepted
the portfolio of State, publicinterest seems
to center upon the appointment of a Sec
retary of the Treasury. Charles Emory
Smith has been mentioned more fre
quently and considered in connection with
this position more than any one else to
the present time, but unoiher name has
been suggested which will also receive due
consideration at the hands of thy Presi
dent-elect. The other Treasury possibility
is Congressman J. M. McCleary of Min
nesota.
He attracted the attention of the Presi
dent-elect by his forcible speeches in Con
gress on the silver question. He was here
once during and once since the campaign.
Major McKinley is very favorably im
pressed with Mr. McCleary, who is a
Canadian by birth, and was an educator
before he went into politics. The Presi
dent-elect would be glad to find a suitable
man for Secreiary of the Treasury outside
of New York, in that no suspicion of com
plications with Wal^street muy attach to
him. Still, if the best man for the place
is clearly shown to be in New York, the
appointment will be made from that State.
The friends erf General Algpr, who was
here from time to time, are very hopeful
at present. He wants to be Secretary of
the Navy. Ihe Republican party of
Michigan has practically been consoli
dated in favor of General Alger, according
to Senator Burrows, and in this respect
be is a much stronger Cabinet possibility
than Henry C. Payne of Wisconsin or
ex-Governor Merriam of Minnesota, who
are opposed by influential factions in
their respective State?.
It is apparent to all careful observers
that Mr. Payne, ex-Governor Mer.-iam
and Governor Alger cannot all be ap
pointed to tho cabinet, for tho reason that
they come from the same section; so, if
Mr. Payne and Governor Merriam should
be dropped from the list o' possibilities,
the chances of ex-Governor Alger wouhi
be sreatly improved.
It is thought that the present week will
see the President-elect reach a deiinite
conclusion respecting the appointment of
a Cabinet officer from the Pacific Coast.
Judge Joseph McKenna is thought by
those much given to Cabinet speculation
to be in the lead. He served in Congress
with Major McKinley, ana was on the
Committee of Ways and Means with him.
There hangs in Major McKiuley's Study a
portrait of the members of the Ways
and Means Committee, of wnich Mr. Mc-
Kinley was chairman, and the man next
to the President-elect in the picture is
Joseph McKenna.
On the walls of the same room is a large
and handsome picture of Judge Nathan
Goff of West Virginia, who is one of the
strongest Cabinet possibilities.
An effort of persistency and vigor is be
ing made to secure the appointment to
the position of Secretary of Agriculture
of a West Virginia man. The name
heard most frrquentlv in this connection
is Congressman James Wilson of West
Virginia. Mr. Wilson is strongly indorsed
by many as a succe-sful farmer and busi
ness man. The President-elect is in no
baste in making this appointment, and it
may be one of the last agreed upon.

Great Efforts to Revve Him.
OMAHA, Nebr., Jan. 17.â Charles A.
Kirk, partner in the firm of James S. Kirk
& Co., the big soap manufacturers of Chi
cago, died to-night at 10:15 o'clock at the
Paxton Hotel of heart failure.
He had been in the city since Friday,
but had made no complaint of ill-health
till yesterday aiiernoon, and, although no
serious results were anticipated, his
personal friends kept close watches after
they knew that Mr. Kirk had heart weak
ness, despite his rugged appearance. At
7 o'clock to-day they found him uncon
scious, having suffered an attack during
the hour previous. Every effort possible
was made to resuscitate him by nis physi
cians, and with such hope of success that
shortly after 1 o'clock one of them went
to lunch while the other began preparing
restoratives. Just as the patient seemed
about to revive, he suddenly collapsed at
10:15 without having regained conscious
ness.
in Chicago Mr. Kirk was known in pub
lic us an ex-Park Commissioner. He was
one of twelve members of ex-Chief Bade
noch'a staff at the time of his death and a
member of several prominent business and
social clubs. He resided on the North
Side.
A NNABEL'S FATHER DEAD.
The Man Who Complained of the Seeley
IHnner /Â» -*o il/orÂ«.
NEW YORK, N, V., Jan. 17.â William
S. Moore, the theatrical agent, who was
the cause of Captain Chapman of the
Tenderloin station raiding the famous
Seeley dinner at Sherry's by reporting
that his stepdaughter Annabel, the
dancer, had been asked to do an im
modest dance, died at his residence in this
city this afternoon of pneumonia.
Moore was 52 years old and was born in
Philadelphia. He was at one time the
manager of the "Little Tycoon" opera
company and also acted as manager of
H. R. Jacobs' theaters and of Henry
Miner's .Eighth-avenue Theater in this
city. He was also manager of the Im
perial opera company.
Since the Seeley dinner Moore has been
greatly worried over the publicity that
came to him and his family over the
affair. Mrs. Moore thinks that it has
tened his death.
CZARINA SERIOUSLY ILL.
Absolute Itent and Quiet Accessary for
Her lircovery.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 17.â The Sunday
Times confirms the report of the illness of
the Czarina. It says that her condition,
which is very serious, has ended for the
present the hopes of the. birth of an heir.
To this fact was, due: the abandonment of
the usual receptions during the Russian
New Year week. Her physicians say that
it is necessary for her to take a long rest
at Livadia on the Czar's estates in South
ern Russia, where Czar Alexander 111
died in 1894. Here she can have perfect
quiet, which is a prerequisite to her re
covery. â  â¢'-'â â¢â  ' . â¢

One Plucky Woman Who Sat
Unmindful Nearly Caused
a Riot
Ex uting Scene in Co'.umb a Theater
During a Perlormance of
Sousa's "El Capitan."
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 17.â Hundreds of
excited and indignant theatergoers took
the high hat question into their own
hands to-night at the Columbia Theater
by hisses and yells that amounted to a
tumult.
They compelled every woman who was
present at the first nisht of Sousa's "El
Capitan" to sit bareheaded through the
performance â all but those in the boxes
and one woman in the parquet, who, in
spite of the yells and cat-cails that came
down at her from the balcony and gal
lery, Kept her wide-brimmed headgear on
all through the opera.
The noisy demonstration began before
the curtain went up for the first act and
continued until after the opera had be
gun, drowning out the music and, for a
few minutes, threatening to break up the
performance altogether.
Finally it was quieted by the ushers
when there were no more hats to come off,
and the play went on smoothly. The au
dience, however, was noisy all the even
ing, and the excitement did not subside
till after the people were outside the play
house.
The theater was packed when the trou
ble began from the top row of the gallery
to the front row of the orchestra. Nobody
knows who started the demonstration.
From the suddenness of the outburst it
might hare suggested itself to a hundred
persons at the same instant.
It began wiih yells of "bats off" that
were interspersed with hisses and groans
as some of the women showed a disposi
tion not to obey. When the hisses came
the hats in tue parquet and dress circle
went off as if they had been caught by a
sale behind.
REDMOND ON ENGLISH PRISONS.
The Member of Parliament Says They Are
the Most Brutal and Revolting
in the World.
LYNN, Mass., Jan. 17.â Hon. John E.
Redmond, M. P., who is visiting in this
city, was this afternoon tendered an in
formal reception by about 150 of the lead
ing citizens at the Clover Club.
Mr. Redmond, at the request of the
chairman of the reception committee, de
livered a brief address, in which he said
that what interested him in this country
was the prison system, which was far
ahead of England. Tha latter was, in his
opinion, the most brutal in the world, and
might be declared as a system of solitude
and silence. The entire system was so
brutal and revolting that it drove many
men insane from the tortures inflicted on
ihem.
"The treatment of the Irish political
prisoners in thi British prisons is some
thing too horrible to contemplate," he
said. 'Ori inally there were eightten of
these prisoners, but three of them died of
the hardships they underwent, and rive
were driven insane, two of the latter be
ing Dr. Gallagher and George A. White
head, who are now in this country in the
care of their friends."
Mr. Redmond said that he once visited
John Daly in Portland prison, and
through the cape broke to him the sad
news of the death of a very dear friend.
Daly broke down at the news, and when
he recovered Mr. Redmond wished to give
him a small photograph of the friend and
a lock of tiis hair, but the prison officials
would not allow it.
SURGEON'S KNIFE FOR THE CZAR.
Made Necessary by an Injury Received in
Japan on Hs Noted Trip Around
the World.
ST. PETERSBURG, Ru,sia, Jan. 17.â
Yesterday a sum'mona was 3ent to Berlia
for Professor Bergmann, the distinguished
Gernti-.n snrjfffon, \o corse to \his city no
perform an operation upon the Czar to
prevent the extension of an osseous ex
crescence which has appeared in the
region of the cranium. â¢
This trouble is due to the blow inflicted
by a fanatical Japanese when he was
traveling in Japan in 1891.
His Majesty was visiting the town of
Otsa on May 11 of that year, when he was
making a tour of the world, and was set
upon by the fanatic, who would probably
have inflated more serious injuries had it
not been for Prince George of Greece, who
accompanied his Majesty, and who
knocked the assailant down. This osseous
growth, which Professor Bergmann will re
move, has, combined with overwork,
caused the attacks of from which
the Czar has suffered for some time.

Havana.
BOSTON, Mass., Jan. 17.â The Globe to
day publisnes a lengthy letter from a
special correspondent sent to Pinar del
Rio to substantiate the reported death of
Maceo and to present the actual facts
bearing on the situation among the insur
gents in that province in Cuba. The letter
was !-ent from San Cajento on January 10,
and at the outset says that unless assist
ance of many kinds come to the rebels in
this province within the next month or
six weeks, there will be no rebels to assist.
Oi the force that Maceo h;id when he
made his second invasion only a r. muant
of 650 remain, umier the command of
Brigadier-General Rivera, says the writer.
Rivera, who has received no intim.ition
that he is to succeed Maceo, is practically
in hiding on the northern coast with bis
force, who are without ammunition and
without hope practically. General Rivera
warmly greeted the writer and discussed
at length the situation. The best jaews he
had to give is as follows:
"I do not wish to criticize our friends in
the United States, but our forces in Pinar
del Rio have been somewhat neglected.
We have been depending upon our strat
egy and knowledge of the province to keen
us out of serious trouble. We have a
dynamite gun and two shell pieces, but
for some time past we have had no am
munition for them. We are not in need
of men at all. You may think this is a
strange statement as you look about and
see my command of only a few hundred
But In Cuba the whole native population
is with us, and I am continent an army of
50,000 could be placed in Havana province
before winter is over if we but had the
arms and ammunition to gÂ»ve ttie men.
"The natives are ready and willing to
die for our cause, but we are not ready or
crazy enough to face the enemy's bullets.
Give us 10,000 rifles and a fuppiy of am
munition and wÂ« will whip Weyler and
hid trocha.
"The force with which Maceo entered
the province has not been killed off by the
enemy. It was disbanded because it be
came unwieldy and could not be handied
with advantage to ourselves. As it is, I
am able to keep 40,000 or 50,000 troops of
the enemy warring ana yet not suffer any
serious loss. The enemy hai concen
trated all its attention upon tnis province,
and while we have not suffered in a last
ing way we demonstrated that we could
remain in the province and fool a big
army and many generals. While Weyier
lias directed ail his efforts against us,
Gomez has been preparing for his march
westward. Gomez will enter Matanza3
with a much larger number of men ilian
were in the combined lorces last year, and,
you mark me, he wili sweep Havana
as well."
MACEO'S DEATH A CERI AINTY.
Mo Longer a Dnubt as to the Intrepid
Ufirrior's Fate.
NEW YORK, H. V., Jan. 17.â A Tribune
special from Jacksonville, Fia., say*,:
A letter was received here on Friday
from Colonel Andre Hernandez, now in
command of the Cuban army eucampeJ
near Havana, giving the true account of
Maceo's death and his subsequent burial.
As he says that he was in command of
the Cuban detachment that recovered the
boly from Major Cirujeda's command
and afterward buned it his statement
settles the matter. The letter was yen t to
J. A. Huau, the foreign representative of
the New York Cuban junta. It came
through the "underground" channel. It
is dated January 9, from the "encamp
ment near Havana." After extending to
Mr. Huau tturnks for past favors the letter
goes on:
It was on December 7 that we suffered a
great misfortune in the tragic death by am
bush of oar leader, Maceo. This is the great
est misfortune we have buffered siuce the be
ginning of the war, but it only encourages us
to fight the harder and avenge his death. We
were encainped^near the fight that day and
heard the firing. Maceo came across the
trocha, unknown to us, with but forty men.
More than 1500 Spaniards, who had been in
formed of his trip, anibu:>hed him. He rode
into it and was snot at the first tire.
We heard the firing, and ihinting that some
of our friends were attacked by the Spanbh
guerillas started off Â«t once to their aid,
though we bad but 400 men. When we
reached the scene of the slaughter it was
mostly over, and then we were tola that
Maceo was dead and that the enemy had his
body tieJ to a horse's tail and were taking it
cff. Oar men were perfectly frantic over the
report and begged to be led against the
Spaniards. We dashed forward with ilrawu
machetes, and what a fight that wa< !
The Span i'lrds met us and the encounter was
horrible. Our men fought to kill, only bent
on avenging .viaceo. Our trusty and sharp
machetes fell with regularity aud I think we
killed more than 200 of the euemy ; and what
is more, we had the consolation of recovering
the body of our beloved leader, Maceo. The
Spaniards fought hard to regain It, charging

on us repeatedly, but our machetes were too
much for them and they sullenly retired.
Our little force suffered terribly. Our
cavalry, which went in eighty strong, came
out with only twenty-two men, and the infan
try suffered almost in the same proportion.
But for all that we were consoled by the fact
that our brave brothers gave up their lives in
a good cause aud to save the body of our
lamented Maceo from the desecration the
Spaniards would hav3 Inflicted. We buried
the body in a secret and secure place. Only
myself &nd a few selected officers know the
place. In due time it will be marked.
IJIf known now, the murderous Spaniards
would try to get It and parade it to show lhe.it
great triumph. â¢
Poor Maceo sleeps, but his brothers remain
to avenge him. I have a great many impor
tant things to tell you in connection with this,
but Ido not care lo put them in this, as I am
not sure this letter will get through safely.

the Olivette brine news of the revolution
in Cuba. Forto Principe and Santiago
are practically in the hands of the Cu
bans, the Spaniards not daring to leave
their fortresses except under the protec
tion of a strong escort. In fact the whole
eastern portion of the island is now under
the government of the Cubans.
Weyler permits nothing against his in
terest to pass his censorship, but it now
comes out that the 200 wounded men sent
into Havana last week were the result of
an attack made on the trocha, twenty
miles from Havana by a Cuban column.
It is now ascertained that the Cuban
general, Jose Maria Aguirre, died of pneu
monia at El Inglis, in the Province of
Havana on the 2Uth ultimo.
The Spaniards are driven from the
country into the cities and are fortifying
tnem. They continue the work day and
night at Havana. On Sunday morninc,
before the Olivette left, the Spaniards
were out practicing with heavy artill ery.
The stories published in tn.l3 country
that the rebel leaders are ready to treat on
the basis of autonomy are denounced as
slanders on Cuban manhood.
They are emphatic in the statement
that the Cubans will never accept any
thing at the hands of Spain but absolute
independence. Gomez has never author
ized anything to the contrary.
It is reported that Fondevila continues
to butcher pacificos at Guanaoacoa.
A large body of insurgeu;s under Cas
tillo and Delgado is reported near Havana.
It is also reported that General Caluto
Garcia hes defeated General Segura, in
flicting n lo<s of 500 ki.led and wounded
on the Spaniards.

FOR RESTRAINING DAMS.
Members From. mining Counties Ask for
an Appropriation.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., J%n. 17.â Four
years ago the Legislature appropriated
$250,000 to be expended in building re
straining dams to hold mining debris.
The money was allowed on condition that
Congress should expend an equal amount
to protect the navigable streams. Subse
quently Congress appropriated an equal
sum. The State appropriation, however,
has lapsed, and the members represent
ing the mining counties now insist on a
reapproiiriation of the money. They con
tend that the reappropriatJon measure
BQouifl take precedence of the bill allow
ing $300,000 for dredging the lower rivers.
The money allowed by Congress cannot
be used unless the Slate comes forward
with an equal amount.
The indications are that the two bills,
allowing in the aggregate $550,000, will be
passed and approved.

SACRAMENTO, Cal , Jan. 17.â Bills

Embassador ITil Gives a Court Recep
tionâThe Fuic;ioi Is Conducted
With Great Pomp.
[Copyright, 1897, by ihe United Associated Presses]
BERLIN, Germany, Jan. 17.â Under in
structions from ihe foreign committee,
Baron yon Jeltsch, German Embassador
to the Porte, has driven persistent support
to M. Nelidoff, the Russian Embassador,
throughout the series of Enibassadorial
conferences held in Constantinople whicli
are to be terminated, but in the discussion
of the financial and administratis'e re
forms proposed by M. Nelidoff, however,
Baron Saurma has taken no prominent
part.
M. Cambon and Sir Philip Currie, re
spectively French ami British Embassa
dors, are understood to have obtained im
portant amendments to Russia's pro
posals, which have now received the assent
of the European Governments. These
Embassadors have advocated a distinct
plan of enforcement of the decision of tne
powers and argue that the presentation of
the reform measures to the Sultan should
be accompanied by an explicit declaration
that the powers are prepared to enforce
them by sea and land.
The report is entirely credited in official
and diplomatic quarters here that. Sir
Pliilip Currie placed before theEmbassa
dors a fully matured project of naval aiid
military operations designed to cover the
occupation of Constantinople, the Darda
nelles and Bo3pborus and also to overawe
the Moslem population in the all too
probable event of arising and attempted
massacre.
To any consideration of coercion Baron
Saurma took a decided st >nd in opposi
tion. The Kaiser obviously continues to
bold that the Sultan must be trusted to
carry out the reforms and that his sover
eign rights should not be interfered with.
M. Nelidoff profes>ed ro unwillingness to
agree to the principle of coercion, but op
posed the English proposals on the ground
that they were premature and that the
Suiian mubt have time in wbicn to act.
At this time communications are in
progress between the powers. The Gov
ernments seem to think that the Kaiser's
opposition to coercion will disappear if
France and Russia will consent to act,
and London i* negotiating directly with
Pans and St. P t<>r:-burg. Under uo cir
cumstances will Russia assent to armed
interference until the spring is well ad
vanced, the Black Sea ports unobstructed
by ice and the roa Is and rivers in South
ern Russia in condition. It is a winter of
almost unprecedented mildness tn South
ern Russia, beirjg as warm as early spring
in Odessa, and navigation between Nico
laieff and Kherson is still open ; but it is
not a part of the present Russian policy
to permit concerted armed intervention
in Tnrkey. The Sultan will .et time and
take it.
The Berlin season is now in full swing
and the past week has been one of almost
incessant festivity. The reception given
to the members of the court at the United
States Ambassy by Ambassador Uhl was
a magnificent function. The ha. l was re
splendent with brllino /uniform^ and the
costumes of jeweled labile?, wnnse dia
monds presented a mo3t d^zzlin^ contract.
Embassador Uhl, who stood in the
librarary, was suppored on either side by
Messrs. I. B. Jackson and H. C. Pquire *
respectively first and E econd secretaries of
the American embassy, while the official
introducer of the German court, ilerr
yon Usedom, as isted by Major Tempsko
and Court Chamberlain yon Combrona,
presented tne diplomat! to the court of
licials. When the ladies were presented
Embassadur Uhl advanced several -teps
to meet them. After the formality of
shaking hands with the gue-ts, Mr. Uhl
led thpm into the adjoining salmon, where
Mrs. Uhl awaited them. Mrs. Tj'hl had
for her supporters her daughters Lucy
and Alice, the former of whom was re
cency married to Professor Guy Thomp
son of Yale University. Coumess yon
Schwanenfeld presented the ladies to Mrs.
Uhl, and the mastpr of ceremonies, Count
yon Kanitz, and Baron yon Rowlerer
presented the gentlemen.
The guests in attendance included all of
the foremn Embas-sador-", with their Â« ives,
the leading members of the foreign em
bassies, leading officials of the Foreign
Office, members of the German Ministry
and many high military â¢ ili rials.
Foilowin^the reception at the American
embassy came Count WedelÂ«ky's nuptial
eve, given upon the occasion of the mar
riage of his daughter to Count Johann yon
Bi-marck-Bohlen of the First Regiment of
Foot Guards. The Emperor was present
at the wadding dinner and presented the
bride with a costly porcelain table.
On Tuesday there was a reception at the
French enit as y similar to that given by
Embasador Uhl, tollowed by a dinner,
and a number of balls and other functions
occurred during the week. Â»
To-morrow will be the festival day of the
Black Eagle order, which will bring to
gether as notable an assemblage of high
military and other dignitaries as Germany
can produce.
On Wednesday a grand court will be
held by their imperial Majesties in the
royal castle, and on the Kaiser's birth
day, January 27, there will be a reception
at the royal castle, followed by a banquet
and a gala opera performance at the Royal
Theater.
On Wednesday, February 3, the Kaiser
and Kaiserin will give a eranrt ball in the
castle. On Ffebruarv 10 their Majesties'
grand ball will take place.
A popular subscription ball is fixed for
February 17 in the Royal Opera-house; on
the following Wednesday another private
ball will be eiven at tbie castle, and on
March 2 a grand maskedjball will be given,
with which the Kaiser and Kaiserin pn>
pose to conclude their Berlin season.
There is also to be an unusual 3trearn
of aristocratic functions. Many well
known princely families who were ab
sentees last season owing to discord with
the Kaiser and nis entourage, have reap
peared, and Berlin court tradesmen are
rejoicing thereat.
The trial of Major Baron yon Tausch,
formerly chief of the political police, on
charges of forgery an<l perjury, will not
begin bofore the end of March. Al
most daily new witnesses are coming for
ward and new charges are cropping nip.
A rather sensational article in the Staats
BergerZeitung seeks to prove that one of
the principal informers against Tausch is
the Berlin correspondent ol a Hanover
paper, Herr H. Keller, once a member of
the staff of the Tagebiatt. The Staats
bureer Zeitung asserts that Herr Keller,
besides "rounding" on Tausch, set to
work to implicate in the case other Berlin
journalists who were in no way connected
with. it. The article reflects the petty

jealousies, if not the corruption, prevalent
in the ranks of Berlin journalists.
It is not surprising that the report gains
credit that the Kaiser has set his face
against the whole system of official and
semi-official journalism, and has r^que ted
all Ministers and leading officials to cease
communication with reporters of news
papers. If greater latitude were allowed
to the expression of opinion in the press
and actions for lesa majeste less easily
brought the disappearance of "inspired"
articles would be beneficial. Ministers
have so long been accu-tonied to supply
j certain papers with views, upon the ap
pearance of which other papers waited
for the keynote of attack or defense, as
to make thp entire cessation of the inspir
ation very embarrassing to some journal
ist.
The reception of Count Goluchowski,
Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, by
the Emperor and Chancellor Prince yon
Hohenlohe on Saturday was of the moat
cordial character, and it is believed that
the assurance-* which lie will receive in re
gard to the status of the Dreibund powers,
in v ! ew of certain European complica
tion*, the pronosed increase of armaments
and other matters, to obtain full informa
tion upon which was the purpose of his
visit, will be entirely satisfactory to the
Austrian Government.
The report of the appointment of Count
Mr.ravifff. who is known to be an ardent
I friend of France and a pronounced Ger
| manophobo, to the office of Russian Mm
I iÂ«ter of Foreign Affairs, has been made
the subject of an unworthy and very un
dienified discussion in the German press,
winch was obviously under the influence
of a scare. The scare is now subsiding,
however, as tne anno"ncement of Count
Muravipff's appointment in the St. Peters
burg Official Mes*encer discloses the fact
that he has merely been nppointed
"Gerant" ot the Foreign Otfire. and is not
\ officially styled Minister of Foreign Af
' fairs as the late Prince Lobanoff waÂ«.
The appointment of a successor to Prince
; Lobanoff, the Messenger says, r main 3in
suspense. The fact is now recognized
that thf promotion of Count Muravieff
n?ed not excite the least d-gree of dis
qnietudp in Germany.
The number of German royalties who

the expressed desire of Empress Frederick
that there = hall be the fullest attendance
of Qieen Victoria's German relatives. The

Dufhesi of Hp=sp, the Crown Prince and

will attend thp celebration. The Czar with

BUSINESS BEFORE CONGRESS.
Appropriation Bills Awaiting Action by the
Senate â Morgan Will Talk on
the Pacific Roads.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 17.âAppro
priation bills will demand the attention
of t c Senate this week. The army bill
has been reported and the military
academy bill will be reported this week.
Senator Morgan will probably address
the Senate committee on his bill for the
appointment of Government trustees to
operate the Pacific roads until the Govern
ment's claim is settled.
The Nicaraguan hill, in accordance with
the decision of the Republican steering
bill committee, will be m;ide the business
for Monday. The guarantee of the canal
oonds will be antagonized by Messrs.
Turpie, Vest, Teller and others.
There is no other indication of any in
tention to call up the Cameron resolution.
The resolution of Mj. Sherman on thsi
subject since the formal announcement of
his acceptance of the State Department
portfolio are looked upon by his associates
as a request from the incoming adminis
tration that nothing should be done pend
ing its accession io power.
Several influential Senators who were
previously charged vr.th being "jingoes"
have since their visit to Canton become
very conservative and no one on the Re
publican side of the chamber is wanting
action of any kind in respect to the war in
Cuba.
The extradition treaties between the
United States and the Orange Free State
and Argentine Republic will probably be
dispose^ of this week and the remainder
of the time will be devoted to clearing up
unobjectionable bills on the calender.
In'tbe House of Representatives no pro
gramme of business has been arranged ex
cept a Virginia contested election case.
It is the expectation of thÂ« committee of

a Farmer.
SOMERVILLE, N. J., Jan. 17.â Fred
Smith, a well-itnown turfman and assist
ant trainer of two great pacers, John R.
Gentry and Robert J, was murderously
assaulted at bis appartments in tbe stables
of Lewis G. Tewksbury, at this place, at
an tarly hour this morning by George
Castler, manager of the Ahred de Cardova
stocK-f trm.
Castler applied to a local Justice at mid
night for a warrant for the arrest of Smith,
who, he alleges, was intimate with his
wife.
The Justice refused to issue the warrant,
as Castler bad not sufficient proof of the
man's guilt.
Castler, accompanied by his father-in
law, then went to Smith's apartments.
Castler, who is a man of phenomenal
strength, broke Smith's nose with a single
blow.
He then grasped him by the throat and
continued his assault with terrible effect,
and would have killed his victim but for
the timely interference of the stablemen.
Smith escaped to a neighboring stable,
where he concealed himself m the hay
mow. W.en discovered by his friends he
was in a pitiable condition. Castler was
still searching for him. Smith's friends
dressed his wounds and hurried him out
of town in a close 1 carriage. He boarded
a train at Bound Brook for New York
City.
At the Bound Brook station be created
a sensation by mistaking an approaching
carriage containing two men for Castler
and bis father-in-iaw. He gave a yell and
sprinted down the track and jumped over
bark-yard femes in his attempt to escape
from his imaginary enemy.
Castler's wife is the daughter of a well
to-do farmer, who wept to-day as he told
the story of his daughter's waywardness.
ELECTRICAL STORM IN OHIO.
Heavy Thunder and Vivid Lightning Cause
Consternation Among the People
of Cleveland.
CLEVELAND, Ohio. Jan. 17â At 5:35
this evening the people of Cleveland were
startled by an electrical storm which
would have been unusual even in
ni dsummer, but coming as it
did in midwinter, it created
consternation, especially amone the
superstitions, for U'htning was vivid, and
the thunder loud ana unusually severe.
This thunderstorm in January was ac
companied by a h avy rainfall, almost as
heavy as the worst siorra last summer.
Just before the electrical storm the at
mosphere became so warm that windows,
were opened and overcoats discarded.
The cold wave signal is now up, anl the
promise is made that it will be 35 degrees
colder Monday morning.
ST. PAUL, Minx., Jan. 17.â A great
storm has been raging in Minne-oia and
the Dakotas for the past iwenty-eiirht
hours, and to-night the temperature is
dropping one degree an hour. The fall of
snow has been very heavy and the wind
has rased furiously.
No trains northwest of St. Paul are run
ning on schedule time. Southern and
Eastern trains left here on time to-night,
but with slight prospects of getting
through. No trains have been operated
on the Great Northern between Huron, S.
Dale., and Benson, Minn., for two weens.
All Northern Minnesota points report
the temperature from 10 to 20 below zero.
The thermometer here registered 10 below
â¢at 11 :30 o'clock to-night, with prospects ol
growing much colder this morning.
MUS&EGON, Mich., Jan. 17.â A steady
downpour of rain which fell to-day has
formed into a gale to-night, and the wind
is blowing off Lake Michigan forty miles
an nonr.
The rain did an immense amount of
damage, as it caused Muskegon Lake to
overflow its banks and h>s covered hun
dreds of acres of celery fields with water.
The ice in the lake is breaking up and is
expected to go out to-night.
OVER 7000 ARE INVITED.
A Great Convention of Manufacturers Will
Be Held Late This Month at
Philadelphia.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Jan. 17.âPostal
card returns thus far received at the office
of tbe National Association ot Manufac
turers indicate that a very large propor
tion of the entire membership of the asso
ciation will be in attendance atthe second
annual convention of the association,
whicu will be held la Philadelphia Jauu
ary 26, 27 and 28. Over 250 members have
already signified their intention of being
present, and this number of delegates will
be largely increased.
Invitations have been sent to over 7000
manuaciurers, ouiside the members of
the a-/ociation, for the purpose of making
this convention a general gathering of
nanuiacturers from all sections of the
country and representing all the branches
of industry.
Attendance of non-members will be un
usually large, as shown by the replies
already received from those who have
definitely decided to be present. The con
vention will be essentially a brief one, and
the programme has been made up with
thia in view.
Many matters of importance to the man
ufacturing interests of the country will be
di.~cu i -sed in the convention, and some
time will be devoted to the foreign trade
of the United States. One feature of par
ticular interest in this connection will be
a symposium on methods of furthering
foreign trade, which will embrace a num
ber of brief addresses of an eminently
practical character, by membersof the as
sociation who have recently visited vari
ous foreign countries, on business.
MASON'S CHANCES GROW LESS.
Ntw Lightning Rods Stuck Up at Spring
fiild fcr the Senatorial
Thunderbolt.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Jan 17. -With the
selection of the membersof the Houseand
Senate, and the appearance on the scene
of two new candidates, the Senatorial ii^li t
becins to assume again the heated char
acter that prevailed at the end of the
week.
The two men are General Calhoun and
Albert J. Hopkins. Neither of these gen
tlemen I as formally announced bis can
diaacy, but Hopkins will open headquar
ters to-morrow morning. It is now
apparent that a number of candidates are
counting on the inability of the caucus to
morrow night to name a candidate, and
hope to get the right transferred to the
floor of the General Assembly, trusiing to
luck to be in the pathway of the senatorial
thunderbolt when it strikes.
With the appearance of these two candi
date*, with a possibility of General John
McNulta entering the field, the chances
of William E. Mason grow less hopeful.
Mr. Muswn's strenpth lies principally in
the districts outside Chicago and the new
candidates are from the agricultural pre
cincts. Each will draw from Mason's
force, and the seventy - six supporters
claimed by Mason will be divided among
the new men. Mr. Hopkins starts out
with the support of his district, which
takes three from Mason, and the other
candidates will be backed by their repre
sentatives in the General Assembly. This
will take from Mason enou h to make his
selection uncertain in the caucus. It is
;i-se.-ted by old politicians that the caucus
cannot poÂ«sibly settle the question.
The machine men think the Cook
County members wiil yet win, even if
they have to put up Governor Tanner as a
compromise candidate. There will be a
fuli caucus of the Republican members
to-morrow night, and it is hoped by the
Cook County delegates to have things so
arranged that their man will then be
finally decided upon, if it is proven con
clusively that Tanner cannot carry the
day.
With the contest in the General Assem
bly it will be anybody's tight, and a mem
orable contest is promised. Congressman
Hitt is conducting a quiet yet energetic
campaign, and his managers assert that
he is the strongest candidate, if the ques
tion is to be decided on merit. The can
didates for the Senatorship now number
fifteen. They are William E. Mason, Con
gressmen Lorimer and Hitt, Josepn Can
non, Walter Reeves, A. J. Hopkins. W. J.
Calhou , Job > M. Smytlie, Samuel W. Al
lerton, George Hunt. Clark E. Carr, W. H.
Harper, ex-Senator Farwell, General John
C. McNulta and ex-Governor Joseph W.
Filer. The Legislature meets at noon

FRESNO'S FIREBUG
AGAIN AT WORK
Applies the Match to the
Presbyterian House of
Worship.
Blaze Discovered and Checked
Before Great Damage Is
Done.
Op?raticns of an Incendiary Who I*
latent on the Destruction of
Churches.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 17.â An attempt
was made to-night to fire the temporary
house of worship constructed by the Pres
byterian congregation, at the corner of
Merced and X streets, since its magnifi
cent church on the same corner was de
stroyea a few months ago. It was a plain
eas- of incendiarism, and tends to prove
the suspicion that Fresno has a fiend
whose objects of destruction are the
churches of the city.
The blaze to-night was discovered before
it gained much headway, and the depart
ment quickly extinguished it. The tire
was on the platform, and the pulpit and
organ were destroyed.
The organ was undoubtedly the place
where the torch was applied, as it was all
ablaze when the firemen broke into the
building. Piled on top of the organ were
the chairs of the choir, and this fact is
conclusive evidence of incendiarism.
When the janitress closed the buildinsr
shortly after 9 o'clock, at the conclusion
of the evening services, the chairs were all
in place where the choir members had left
them. The burning chairs communicated
the blaze to the ceiling. The rear window,
through which the scoundrel undoubtedly
effected an entrance to the room, had
been burned out, and it was therefore im
possible to get any evidence from it.
The fine $10,000 church of the Presby
terians, with its $2-500 pipe organ, was
burned to the ground a few months ago.
In this case the fire also originated on the
pulpit platform. On the same night an
attempt was made to fire the Methodist
church on the corner opposite the site of
the Presbyterian church. A few weeks
before the Baptist church, one of the
finest in the city, was destroyed, and
there was also strong ground for suspicion
of incendiarism there. The Baptist and
Presbyterian churches stood on opposite
corners of the same block. Last Sunday
night a fire was discovered in the Congre
gational churc >, but this was believed to
have been the result of an accident.
MURDEROUS REJECTED SUITOR.
Stabs Four Persons, Including the Bride
groom, at the Wedding of the
Girl He Loved.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 17.â A re
jected suitor caused a riot and bloodshed
to-night at the wedding of the girl whom
he had loved in vain.
The bridegroom and three guests were
stabbed before the police moved upon
the wedding feast, which had become a
riot, and overpowered the enraged and
disappointed man.
The injured, all of whom were cut in
the right arm, are: Charles Barnisky, 18
yean old; Michael Roman, the bride
groom; Henry Roman, brother of the
bridegroom, and Mary Zeppe.
The man with the knife was John Or
nis. He is a tall, powerfully built Hun
garian. He has wooed Agnes Hafri and
at one time be thought thai the girl re
turned bis love. Then Mr. Roman met
Agnes, Roman and Agnes were soon be
trothed and Ornis concealed his chagrin
and was the first to congratulate the
couple.
The wedding took place this evening at
the home of the bride, 118 Sheriff street.
The ceremony was over, the feast was at
its height, everybody was merry and the
spirit of^the wine loosened the tongues of
the guests.
Then some one who had forgotten his
presence turned to Ornis and in a joking
way chided him for his ill-luck in not win
ning so tair a girl. A second later that
guest wished that his idle words had never
left his lips.
Ornis, who had been trying to conceal
his feelinps, became on fire with anger.
He roared a fierce Hungarian curse and
drew a clasp-knife. He rushed first at
the groom, who dodged him and retreated
into a far corner.
A scene of wildest confusion followed.
The furniture was overturned. Women
rfled shrieking about the flat. Some of the
meu tried to overpower Ornis, who cut
right and left with the knife.
The bride screamed and wept and begged
him, for her sake, to desist, but Ornis
made his way to the bridegroom who
threw up bis right arm as a guard and re
ceived a painful wound.
Ornis then stabbed the bridegroom's
brother, buried his knife in the arm of
young Barniski and stabbed the Zeppe

NICARAGUA CANAL BILL
White and Ferkms Be Neve It Will Pass
the Senate â Speaker Reed's Quali
fied Objection.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 17.-The
Nicaragua Canal bill will come up for con
sideration in tne Senate to-morrow. Sen
ators White and Perkins believe debate
will last about three days and that the bill
will pass the Senate. The principal
opposition will come from tne mid
dle' States. The Pacific railroads will
all of them unite in an attfempt to de
feat its passage. The corps of lobbyists
already on the ground is now at work.
Lengthy speeches will be made by Sen
ators White, Perkins, Morgan and others.
Among those who have announced their,
intention of speaking in opposition are
Senators Vest, Turpie and Teller. Senator
Stewart will also probai ly oppose the bill.
The Rules Committee of the House will
in a few days meet to determine whether
or not they will set a time for the bill's
consideration in the House ot Representa
tives. Speaker Reed is said to be not un
favorable"to the canal project, but on ac
couni of the low state of National finances
is unwilling that the Government should
enter into a project of such gigantic im
portance at this time. If the bill can be
called up in tne House and a vote reached
it will probably pass. It might possibly
be vetoed by President CleyHand.
In brief, the bill provides that the
United States shall guarantee the bonds
of the Maritime Canal in the sum of
$100,000,000, such bonds to run for a period
of thirty years and to bear interest at
3 per cent per annum. Tney are lo be is
sued by the Secretary of the Treasury
from time to time, as the canal progresses
in construction. The bonds are to be se
cured by a first mortgage on the property
of the company and its rights heretofore
acquired. Hereafter such mor. gage ia to
contain a provision for a sinking fund
sufficient for the payment ot such bonds
at maturity. There is to be issued to the
United States 700,000 shares of capital
stock, fully paid up and non-assessable.
Eight of the eleven directors are to be ap
pointed by the President of the United
States. The directors are each to receive
a salary ol $5000 a year, except the presi
dent of the board, who shall receive $6000.
Toe canal is to be constructed under the
supervision of the engineering depart
ment of the United States Wu Depart

TALMAGE OS ARBITRATIOS.
He Calls It the Urandest Triumph of
Eighteen Centurie*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 17.â Dr.
DeWitt Talmage, who succeeded Dr. Sun
deriand in the active pastorship of the
Presidential Presbyterian Church in
Wasbinaton, in his sermon this morning
! referred to the arbitration treaty with
Great Britain, characterizing it as the
mightiest ana grandest movement for
driving brutal war out of the earth.
He said the men who, on either side of
the sea, desire most to effect the plan of
arbitration have made themselves im
mortal. :
The administration of the United States
Government had been honored with the
greatest and grandest event of theei^hteen
centuries. All civilized nations will copy
the sublime example. He implored the
Senate to promptly ratify the treaty.
Mr. Cleveland was not present at the
services.
BALD'S BOLD DEFI.
Proposition to JtSce . Enqllth Crack
Wheelmen -tot Accepted.
BUFFALO, N. V., Jan. 17.â Eddie Bald
made a proposition last night to Ed Pinm
mer, the manager of the English cyclists,
to race either Tom Linton or Jimmy Wai
burton a distance of one mile for a stake
of $500 to $5000. Plummer was taken back
by Bald's bold dec, and made no attempt
to make a match.
Linton offered to accept the challenge if
Bald would allow him to have his own
pacemaker, and the race to take place in
England. Bald agreed to race in Eng
land, but insisted that the same pace
makers should act for both men, as the
foreign pacemakers are acknowledged to
be better than the Americans. Linton
would not consent to this, end it is not
likely that America's champion will get a
chance at the crack foreigners in a match

OF A BUND GIRL
Can Describe Persons and
Objects Which She
Cannot See.
Enabled to Read From a Book
by Touching the Pages
With Her Fingers.
Supernatural Gift Acquired During a
Trance, in Which She Saw
Strange Visions.
WALLA. WALLA, Wash., Jan. 17.â
William Gray of Palouse City, here for
medical treatment, yesterday told the fol
lowing story of the supernatural power of
a Palouse City child, which he says is
vouched for by Rev. A. Y. Skee, pastor of
the B. M. E. Church of Palouse. Rev. J.
Ok Kerricfc of La Grande, Or., H. A. Gray,
Thomas Cox and J. B. Cawthorne of Pa
louse. Last August Ethel Gilliam, a lit
tle girl, was taken ill, and, after three
weeks, apparently died. For three hours
. she had every appearance of death. She
4 i slowly revived, but was totall}* blind.
w told her parents that she had been in
en and had se6n Jesus and the angels
and many friends who had gone before.
There she saw a tree of life and a river of
life. There were little chiliren in the
tree eating fruit. Each inhabitant wore a
crown bearing his or her name. The little
girl saw a crown with her name on it
hanging ap and reached for it. but Jesus
told her she could not have it yet, but
that she would have to go back to earth
and fulfill her mission. He wanted fcer to
teach his people.
Although blind, this girl can rend by
passing her fingers over the printed or
written pase, and can describe persons
whose pictures are handed to her. The
latter power was first discovered by J. B.
Cawthorne, a photographer, whose mother
lives in Walla Walla. He told the mar
velous story to a Sunday-schooi in Palouse
City, and Mr. Gray and wife, hearing it,
drove out to the home of the girl to see for
tnemselves. Mr. Gray first handed the
sick girl his watch, ana she told him tuat
it was a gold watch and the time of day by
pa-sing her fingers over the glass. To
make sure that her power was genuine a
paper was held between her face and a
photoeraph that Mr. Gray handed to her,
and she described the picture perfectly as
that of an old gentleman with gray
whiskers and wearing a dark suit and
cravat. She read from books and papers
handed to her by the use of her fingers.
TWO LUCKY FRESNOITES.
Identity of the Men Who Discovered Bandit
Marietta's Hoard Is Made
Known.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 17.â The identity
of the two men who recently unearthed a
* trunk near the cemetery at Firebaugn,
V a was reported to contain over $100,
--\ â â â  ;n gold supposed to have been buried
...ere by Joaquin Murietta, the bandit of
early days, has been revealed. They are
J. N. Smith and L. P. Hendrickson, and
are both employed by the San Joaquin
Electric Company in this city, Mr. Smith
as electrician and Mr. Hendrickson as
trimmer of lamps. Both came to Fresno
from Salt Lake City several months apo,
when the new electric company began the
transmission of power from the San Joa
quin River to this city.
The gentlemen admit that they are the
ones who found the treasure, but refuse
positively to talk any farther about the
matter. They refuse to tell the exact
amount oi their fortune or the exact piace
where they found it. The cause of the
reticence of Smhh and Hendnckson is the
fear of the law of treasure trove, which re
quires that every effurt shall be made'by
those who find anything to ascertain by
posting and advertising the rightful owner
of the thing found. Then, if no owner ap
pears, the State confiscates a good share
pf the find. Hendrickson and Smith are
anxious to retain possession of the entire
fortune they unearthed, and do not wish
to let the authorities know anything about
their find. Thus far they have succeeded
very well in their purpose. The gentle
men are still hoiding their jobs with the
electric company.

SALEM, Ob., Jan. 17.â Twenty-three
members of the lower house of the Ore

LOS ANGELES DENTIST'S PLAINT.
Accuses a Former Assistant of Stealing
Fillings From Abstracted
Teeth.
LOS ANGELES, CAL.Jau. 17.â Dentist
C. A. Cobalt was arrested here yesterday
at the instance of Dr. Scbiff man of the
Schiffman Method Dental Company on a
charge of embezzlement. The charce is
based on the allegation that he appropri
ates a large number of gold fillings from
teeth which he had extracted while in the
employ of the Schiffman company. If
ihere is any foundation for the allegation,
the value of such teeth is in the nature of
clear gain to the dental office where they
are extracted, for it is understood that
usually no compensation is allowed to the
real owners of the teeth.
Dr. Cobalt has put up $150 bail to insure
his appearance in court to-moirow to
answer to the charge. He promises to
make some interesting disclosures wjien
the case is heard in court. Dr. Cobalt
quit the service oi the Schiffman company
recently and sued for back salaiy, since
which time there has been war between
the two dentists.

Handsome Structures Which Add to the Beauty of Phoenix, Ariz,
BAKERSFIELD FIELD TRIALS.
Pacific Coast Dog-Owner* Gathering for
the Annual Content*.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Jan. 17.â For
the seventh time the annual Pacific Coast
field trial sports begins here to-morrow.
The grounds on which they are expected
to take place are situated about twelve
miles south of town. If inclement
weather does not interfere â and the
prospects are that it will not â the event
will be crowned with success. Said a well
known fancier: "The prospects are good
for a season of rare sport, possibly the
best we have ever had at Bakersfield. We
have plenty of birds; the grounds are in
tine fix; everybody is corning and all are
in the best of spirits for the fun."
Many well-known dog-owners have ar
rived and others are expected to-night
and to-morrow. Many of the old-timers
are among them. Strings of fine-looking
canines are to be seen on every hand, and
it is needless to say their owners and
trainers "point with pride" to the sure
winners. Among those who are here with
likely looking strings are: John F. Hughes
of Cupa Valley, i). M. Walters of Los
Angele\ D. M. Dodge, W. F. Tevis, George
T. Allender and Messrs. Lucas and
Coughlan of Marin. Among the promi
nent gentlemen who have already arrived
to see the sport are : Alexander Hamilton,
J. J. Killgariff, J. G. Edwards of San
Francisco, A. B. Trueman, Mr. Keller of
LoÂ» Angeles, Messrs. Stone and Kennedy
of Fresno.
WALLA WALLA'S DISGRACE.
Mad Her amble for an Office Made Vacant
bit Heath.
WALLA WALLA, Wash., Jan. 17.â
Allen H. Crocker, Auditor of this county,
died at his residence late last night of
Bright's disease at the age of 47. He was
elected County Auditor on the Republi
can ticket in 1894 and was re-elected in
1896. The funeral will be held to-morrow.
Before the public in general knew of his
death several persons were trying to se
cure the appointment as Auditor. The
tight soon developed into a bitter one.
County Commissioner Nulder, Democrat,
was the first to make known his can
didacy and at once began work by con
ierring with the two other members of the
board for indorsement. The friends of R.
McGahey, Populist, began urging Mc-
Gahey for the place, while several others,
huugry for the office, made known their
willingness to serve. The result was that
late last night a contest between the
Democrats and Populists occurred. This
is viewed in the light of the most ghoulish
and indecent affair ever having occurred
here.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 18, 1897.
WHITELAW REID
LAUDS ARIZONA
Describes the Western Ter
ritory as a Winter
Paradise.
Experienced but One Unpleasant
Day During Five Months'
Residence.
So Pleased With the Country and
Its Climate That He Decided
to Return.
PHCENIX, Aeiz., Jan. 16.â One of the
moÂ«t interesting articles concerning thts
section of Arizona ever given to the public
was written by Hon. Whitelaw Reid, edi
tor of the New York Tribune, and ap
peared in a recent issue of that journal.
Mr. Reid spent last winter in Phcenx with
bis family, and was so delighted wit the
climate, which proved highly beneficial
to his health, that he decided to return
again this winter. He arrived during
Decemter, and is now domiciled herewith
his family. The article referred to is as
follows:
So many questions are asked about Ari
zona as a place for a winter re-idence, and
there appears to ba such a dearth of pre
cise information among many who are
virtually interested, that it seems almost
a rublic duty to set down, in the simplest
foim, a few facts of personal observation.
WEATHER
During a five months' residence in
Southern Arizona in winter, there was bat
one day when the weather made it actually
unplea sant for me to take exercise in the
open air at some time or other during tne I
day.Of course there were a good many days |
which a weather observer would describe |
as "cloudy," and some that were
"show rt" ; but during Â»hese five months
(from November, 1895, to May, 1896), there
were only four days when we did not have
brilliant sunshine at some time during: the
day. Even more than Egypt, anywhere
north of Luxor. Arizona is the land of sun
shine. As to details.
TEMPEBATUBE.
The Government reports show a mean
temperature (or fourteen years at the pres
ent Territorial capital of 57}4 degrees in
November, 53 in December, 49 in January,
54 in February, 61 in March and 66 in
April. The same reports show the high
est and iowest temperatures, averaged ior
eight years, at the same place, as follows:
For November 7%}4 degrees and 42, Decem
ber 73>Â£ and 36^, January 65% and 82,
February 71^ and 35% March 81U and
41 and April Bt>^ and 46. The nights
throughout the winter are apt to be cool
enough for open wood fires and blankets.
Half the time an overcoat is not needed
durine the day, but it is never prudent
for a stranger to be without one at hand.
AIR.
The atmosphere is singularly clear, tonic
and dry. I have never seen it clearer any
where in the world. It seems to have
about the same bracing and exhilarating
qualities as the air of the Great Sahara in
Northern Africa, or of the deserts about
Mount Sinai in Arabia Petrsea. It is much
drier than in the pans of Morocco,
Algiers or Tunis usually visited, and drier
than any part of the valley of the Nile
north of the first cataract. It seems to
me about the same in quality as the air of
the Nile between Assouan and Waay-
Halfa, but somewhat cooler.
ACTCAL HUMIDITY.
The humidity of the atmosphere
is extremely slight everywhere in
Arizona as compared with any
Eastern climate in the United States.
Tne air is driest on the high mesa*,
remote from snow - clad mountains
or forests, and in the desert valleys wheie
no considerable irrigation has been begun.
Wherever irrigation is carried on on a
large scale the percentage of humidity in
the atmosphere must be somewhat in
creased, although to an Eastern visitor it
is scarcely perceptible. Tne same Govern
ment observations already cited show rela
tive humidity, at Phoenix or Tucson, aver
aged for weeks, from morning and even
ing readings, as -less than half the usual
humidity on dry days in New York.
General Greely, in a publication from the
Weather Bureau, gave the normal weight
of aqueous vapor in the Arizona air at
from 1% to 4 grains per cubic foot.
BAIN.
Showers, and indeed heavy rains, are
liable to occur in every mouth of the year,
but the actual number of rains seems to
an Eastern visitor strangely small. The
average rainfall in Southern Arizona, as
shown by the Government observations,
is but 8)4 inches per year.
ALTITUDES.
It is a striking advantage offered by
Arizona t at, with the same general con
ditions as to temperature and dryness of
air, the physician is able to select nearly
any altitude he may desire. Thus, asth
matic sufferers can find almost the sea
level at Yuma, or an altitude of only a
thousand fept at Phoenix, or of only 2400
at Tucson. Others, who find no objection
to greater elevations, can choose between
Prescott and Fort Whipple, 5400; Flag
staff, 6300; the Salpaur Spring Valley or
Fort Grant, 4200; Fort Huachuca, 4800, or
Oracle, about 4000.
18 IT A PI/ACE FIT TO LIVE IN?
This depends on what one expects in a
huge, sparsely settled Territory of moun
tains and deserts. The man Who looks
for either the beauty or the seductive ex
citement of Monte Carlo will not find it.
As little will he find the historic remains
of the cosmopolitan attractions of Egypt;
nor could he reasonably expect the amuse
ments and luxuries of our own Eastern
cities. The people of Arizona are still
chiefly busy in the pioneer work of sub
duing it to the residence and uses of civil
ized man. But it has two transconti
nental lines of railway, with numerous
feeders; it has fast, mails and; rival tele
graph lines, and is throbbing with the in
tense life ot the splendid West. The two
principal towns in the southern portion
chiefly sought for the : .r climatic ad
vantages are Phoenix and Tucson. Each
of them has 10,000 inhabitants or more.
They have the electric lifiht, telephones,
trolley-cars, plenty of hotels, banks, book
stores, srood schools, churciies, an occa
sional theatrical performance, sometimes
a lecture or a circus, often a horserace,
and in the apr.n t a thoroughly curious
and interesting "fiesta." For the rest,
people must take their amusements with
them. Good horses are abundant and
cheap, and there are plenty of cowboys â
tne genuine article â to show what horses
can do. The driving, for fifteen or twenty
miles in almost any direction from
Phoenix, is neirly always easy. The roads
are apt to be dusty; but there is one well
sprinkled drive of six or eight miles; and,
since the winds are quite regular in their
direction, it i< rarely difficult to choose a
route on which the dust will be largely
carried away from you. The unbroken
desert itself is often as easy to drive over
as an Eastern highway, and the whole
valley is a paradise for bicyclers or
equestrians.
CAN ONE LIVE COMFORTABLY?
That, again, depends on what you ex
pect. You cannot have the luxuries of
our New York houses out there, unless
you build one; or the variety of our New
York markets, unless you charter a re
frigerator car. But there are hotels with
almost a frontage as the Waldorf ; and, line
everything else in the Territory excepting
the mountains and the de-ens, they are
hew. There are boarding-nouses of more
Kinds than one; and brick cottages of
eight or ten rooms can occasionally be
rented. Better than any of them, tor the
man with enertiy and pluck to take, it is a
tent on the desert; and he who knows
how to "camp out" with comfort through
September in the Adironda,oks can camp
out in Arizona through the winter. As to
food, there is plenty, and it is good â if
you can get it well cooked. The alfalfa
fields of the Salt River Valley are the fat
tening grounds for the great cattle ranges
of the Territory. Trom there the mar
kets of Los Angeles, and even of Denver,
are largely supplied. Good beef, mutton
and poultry aro plenty and cheap. Quail,
duck and venison from the vicinity can
also be had. Vegetables and fruits are
abundant in their season, and sometimes
the season is a long one. It is the one
country I have lived in wh^re strawberries
ripen in the open air ten months in the
year. I have had them on my table, fresh
picked from the open garden, at Christ
mas.
IS IT A LAWLESS COUNTRY?
The man who goes to any considerable
Arizona town with the ideas of the South
west derived from novels, or from The
Arizona KicKer, will be greatly mystified.
He will find as many churches as in towns
of corresponding size in Pennsylvania or
Ohio; and probably more school houses.
He will find plenty of liquor shops, too,
and gambling-house*, and danoÂ«houses.
and yet he will see little disorder unless
he hunts late at ni^ht for it, and he will
be apt to find â as at Phoenix â a commun
ity of 10,000 people requiring in the day
time only one policeman, and hardly re
quiring him. During my winter there I
aid not see a single disturbance on the
streets, or half a dozen drunken men, all
told. Mining men and an occasional cow
boy certainly had quarrels sometimes, in
the disorderly quarters at night; and there
were stories of the use of the knife among
Mexicans; but the visitor who went about
his own business had as little trouble* as
on Broadway or Chestnut street. The
Pima and Maricopa Indians, who are en
countered everywhere, have been friendly
with the whites for generations, and there
isn't an Apache within some hundreds of
miles.
WHICH TOWN IS THE BEST?
Primarily that is a question for the phy
sician, if there is a physician in the case;
if not, try them all. [Here favorable ref
erence i-> made to Prescott, Flagstaff,
Yuraa, Tucson and Oracle, but lack of
space compels us to omit this part of the
letter.] Phoanix ia in the center of the
greatest irrigation in the Territory. The
country for miles around smiles with
green fields, covered with almost count
less herds of cattle, and it is everywhere
shut in by low mountains. It is the Terri
torial capital, has the Government Indian
School, the Territorial Lunatic Asylum
and other institutions, ana is the general
focus for the Territory. Like Tucson, it
has its occasional wind and sand storms â
perhaps not quite so often. At either
place visitors who know how to adapt
themselves to circumstances can be en
tirely comfortable, and in each they will
find an intelligent, orderly, enterprising
and most hospitable community. They
will find a country full of mines, full of
rich agricultural lands, abounding in
cattle and horses, in vineyards and
orchards and the beginning of vrey suc
cessful orange groves â a country, in fact,
as full of promise for hardy and adven
turous men now as California was in the
'50' s. Above all, if it has been their lot
to search for health in far-off countries,
they will revel in the luxury of being in
their own land, among their own country
men, within easy .reach of their friends
by telegraph or rail, and in a climate as
gooi of its kind as any in the world.
TRAMPS EAT A STOCKTON DOG.
Appropriate a Fat Gordon Setter and
Soon Have the Animal in a Very
Bad Stew.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 17. â Pound
master Thomas Horton of this city is
authority for the following story: Some
time ago be gave an old man who is
known here as "Larry, the king of the
dumps," an old mule that he had im
pounded. Larry killed the mule and
"jerked" a portion of the meat, placing it
over barbed wire fences to dry. T c rest
of the carcass be gave to a large Gordon
setter dog, feeding a portion of it to the
canine day by day for a week. The dog
waxed fat on the mule, and Larry watched
the string of "jerked" meat that he was
preparing for spring use.
Several nights ago a gang of tramps ap
pealed on trie peninsula near the bunkers
of the Coal road ana stole every bit of the
"jerked" meat. They hailed from the
southern country and had their appetites
with them. After whetting their appe
tites on the mula meat they waylaid the
big fat Gordon setter and soon had the
animal killed and in a stew. Wnen
Poundmaster Hor.on appeared at the
camp this morning he saw the tramps
finishing the remnants of the stew, the
carcass of the canine lying close by.
The matter was reported by him to the
police to-night, but the tramps have gone,
and even an action for cruelty to animals
will not avail unless they come this way
again. s
Prizefight at Singer.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 17.â There was an
interesting prizefight last night at Banger,
fifteen miles east of this city, in which
John Fitzarerald, a local celebrity, andl
William Ross, a pug from Visalia, were
the principals. Fitzgerald received a
knockout blow in the neck in the second
round. The fight was for a purse of $100.
The affair took plack in the Depew Opera
House and was witnessed by a big crowd,
a lar?e delegation of sporting men from
this city being in attendance. Ross and
Fitzgerald fought two weeks ago and
Ross was the victor then also. Both
rights were vicious, science being at a dis
count and hard slogging at a premium.

Funding's Defeat Pleases Modesto.
MODESTO, Cal., Jan. 17.â There was
no outward demonstration here in cele-
bration of the defeat of the Powers' rail
road bill. While every one spoken to
upon tne subject expressed himself as
gratified at the result, the feeling did not
reach the pitch of enthusiasm. The de
feat of the measure is undoubtedly what
the masses of the people of this vicinity
wished.
The forts around Paris are stored with

JAMES TREADWELL
UNDER ARREST
The Young Millionaire Is
Accused of Striking
a Woman.
Louise Buchanan Exhibits a Cut
Lip in Court to Prove
Her Charge.
He Says He Was Forced to Vigorously
Defend Himself Against
Assailants.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 17.â James P.
Treadwell, the young millionaire, was jar
rested last night on a charge of battery,
preferred by Louise Buchanan, who ex
hibited a cut lip as evidence. He was ar
rested by Officer Hughes and released on
$100 cash bail, with instructions to appear
in Justice Gass* court to-morrow morn
ing.
The Buchanan girl threatened young
Treadweli with a suit about two years ago,
claiming he had wronged her, and gained
much notoriety. No suit was commenced,
however, and the girl left San Jose. The
reported marriage of Treadweli to Mrs.
Welch of San Francisco last week aroused
Miss Buchanan's ire, and she came to
San Jose several days aso, with the
avowed intention of making Tread well's
life miserable by annoying him.
It is claimed that last evening the girl
and a man were drinking together in the
Louvre, while a messenger was sent out to
find Treadweli. When the latter appeared
and asked what was wanted of him Miss
Buchanan and her friend attacked him.
Treadweli was obliged to vigorously de
fend himself. He refused to talk about
the affair to-day.
Jewels Taken by Burglars.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 17.â The resi

the center, a twisted gold bracelet, a gold
chain and a pair ot gold earrings were
taken. Entrance was effected through a
rear window.
Sailed Up Alviso Channel.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 17.â That Alviso
Slough could be made an excellent water
way by a small expenditure on the part of
the Government is evidenced by the fact
that two large schooners, the Fortuna and
Daisy Rowe, drawing 12 and 11 feet of
water respectively, are now unloading
lumber at Alviso. The cargo of the For
tuna is 225,000 feet and the Daisy Rowe
196.000 feet. Both of the vessels easily
sailed up the channel. Captain Rossich
of the Fortuna reports the channel very
eood and with the slight expense of
straightening out one or two turns of the
slouch vessels drawing 14 feet oi water
could sail up to Aiviso.

VISALIA MAN'S INVENTION.
Weight of Water Utilized to Store Power
in a Dynamo.
VISALIA, Cal., Jan. 17.-M. S. Mon
roe, connected with the water works plant
of this city, has made public an import
ant mechanical invention. It is designed
to utilized dead weight of water in stor
ing power in a dynamo. The weight of
the water in two immense tanks twenty
feet in length and standing thirty feet
above ground, supplying this city with
water, will be used to supply a dynamo
with power equal to a twenty horsepower
engine. As the water in the tanks falls a
connecting cable will wind up a strong
steel spring in the dynamo. The inventor
feels confident that his plan can be suc
cessfully used as a wave motor, every fall
ing wave on the ocean beach adding to
the power stored in the dynamo, Mr.
Monroe will keep the details of his inven
tion secret until it is patented.

EVADES ALASKA'S COURTS.
Indictment Against Ex- Marshal Porter
Quashed on Orders From
Washington.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Jan. 17.â
The steamship Al-Ki from Alaska this
morning brought news of great excite
ment there as a result of the information
that the prosecution of ex-United States
Marshal Orville T. Porter, on a charge of
embezzlement under a Grand Jury indict
ment, had been quashed through direct
and specific orders from the Attorney-
General at Washington to the District At
torney of Alaska. The charge had been
hanging over Porter since shortly after
his retirement at the end of Harrison's ad
ministration, but he had evaded trial by
various pretexts, claiming that he was ill
at his home in Oregon. The authorities,
who had determined to bring him up at
all hazards during the present term of
court, were surprised when orders to Btop
ail proceedings were received.
According to allegations under which
the ex-Marshal wae indicted, the money
which disap; earod was sent to Porter to
discbarge numerous outstanding el a inn
for jury and witness fees. When the
shortage was discovered it was arranged
that Porter take up outlying claims, but
continued failure to do so prompted the
filing of the information with the Grand
Jury, upon which a true bill was found.
Porter received his appointment during
Harrison's administration through the
influence of Senator John H. Mitchell of
Oregon, and it is believed by those inter
ested that Mitchell prevented the trial of
bis friend.

TRUCKEE, Cal., Jan. 17.â T0-day has
been a gala one for the many who visited
the Truckee Ice Palace. Three cars bear
ing members of the Mystic Shrine, their
families and friends arrived at 6 o'clock
this morning from San ' Francisco, and a
euecial train from Sacramento arrived in
the afternoon. The visitors enjoyed
themselves at sleign riding, coasting and
skating. Sleighs running from Truckee to
Dormer Lake and to the Dormer Ice Com

The Dormer Company has one of the mo3t
perfect ice plants in this vicinity.
The visitors realize â many of them for

California.
Yesterday they left homes where the
rose was blooming, and to-day they en
joyed as fine winter sport as mortals ever
had, and under a clear sky and bright sun,
returning to their homes again within
thirty-six hours.
To-night the toboggan slide was running
to its full capacity. The stating rink
within the ice palace was crowded, and
there were not skates enough in town to
supply all who wanted to enjoy the exer
cise. The Shriners made merry at a ban

MERKLE'S PETRIFIED FOOT.
He Uses the Sole for a Whetstone and
He Gave Away a Toe.
A hunting party from El Paso, Texas.,
but recently returned from an expedition,
tells of the marvelous discovery up in the
mountain regions oi what seems to be one
of the greatest living wonders. The find
is nothing more nor less than a man, liv
ing and apparently in good health, yet
having one foot completely petrified.
The tale is a pretty stiff one and would
not be credited were it not vouched for by
gentlemen of well-known veracity and
honor, who furthermore have and are
ready to exhibit the little toe from the
petrified foot, which was broken off
shortly before their visit and which the
owner was kind enough to give them as a
souvenir.
. The man with the petrified foot is an
ex-cowboy, Bill Merkle by name, who has
lived in the mountains nearly twenty-five
years. Up to twenty year 3 ago Merkle
lived thÂ« most active of outdoor lives, but
about that time, in trying to get out of
the way of a stampeding drove, he was
thrown from bis horse right in the track
of the cattle, the nerd sweeping on resist
le?sly over his prostrate body.
When picked up by his companions a
few moments later, not a bruise was dis
covered anywhere upon his body, but both
bones of the left leg appeared to be broken
just below the knee. No physician was
called in, Merkle's friends merely using
the simple means in their power to set,
splint and bandage the broken limb.
According to Merkle's account, in an in
credibly short time the bones seemed to
be knitting together, but pretty soon it be
came evident that the texture and color of
the flesh below the fracture were under
going a change. â¢
In the course of a month it was deemed
advisable to remove the bandage, when it
was discovered that while the fracture
bad indeed reunited the leg below had al
ready begun to show unmistakable evi
dence of hardening. Since then slowly
the process has continued, till now the
entire limb below the break is a complete
petrifaction.
Strange to relate Merkle declares there
is no pain anywhere in the region of tne
old fracture, and while the weight of the
petrified limb necessarily retards his
progress he can stand upon it and even
taKe a few steps, and his general health is
excellent.
Of course there is no sensation in the
petrified member. It may be struck,
scratched or pricked with impunity, and,
liftihg the foot across his right knee, Mer
kie uses it as a w: etstone, sharpening
knives against the hardened sole. How
ever, if the foot be placed in the fire a sen
sation of hfat is transmitted throughout
the entire body, becoming painful in the
immediate neighborhood of the old frac
ture.âPhiladelphia Times. ,
GERMANY LEADS.
Emperor William's Army Is Larger
Than That or France.
Since the law passed by the Reichstag
on the 29th of June, 1896, Germany has
taken a great stride fn advance of France
in the matter of military organization.
Our entire effective force in infantry
amounts to 324.000 men, while that of Ger
many foots up 364,300, giving the Germans
a numerical superiority of 40,000 foot
soldiers.
On our side of the Vosees tue Derma
ment garrisons are guarded by 2427 com
panies, forming 583 "battalions*. On the
other side of the frontier they number
2498 companies and 625 battalions, a ma
jority over France of forty battalions.
The expenses present a considerable
difference between the two countries. The
pay of the French infantry officers, accord
ing to the war bndget, is nearly 43,000,000,
but that of the officers of the German in
fantry is not less than 48,000,000.
In time of peace our soldiers are kept on
two meals a day, costing 52,000,000, while
the soldiers on the other side of thÂ« Enine
are kept and fed on one meal a day by
means of an appropriation of 60,000,000.
Does not this comparison justify the law
creating a fourth battalion in each one of
the 145 army corps regiments named?
It is believed that the appropriation
which will be asked for on the opening of
the session of the Chamber will be for
thirty additional battalions for 1897.â

' The most aristocratic dog in San Francisco to-day is Dimples, Walter Hobart's
$2500 beauty. She is now nine months old and begins to look like her beautiful
mother, Totsy, the champion of Old English brindle white bulldogs.
Dimcles achieves particular fame by ruason of her father's aristocratic lineage.
He is the celebrated Old English prize-winning bulldog, Napa, which dog haÂ« a
wonderful record throughout Europe. Dimples was imported by the young mil
lionaire and arrived In San Francisco on November 26. Though she belongs to
a breed of dogs that Dever lets go in a fight, Dimples is as gentle as the famous
little lamb that followed the fabled Mary everywhere she went. She generally
stands with her tongue out, as shown in the picture, and is a great favorite at the

CELEBRATION OF A
CATHOLIC FEAST
A Day of Special Devo
tion in St. Ignatius
Church.
Sermon by the Archbishop and
Installation of Sodality
Officers.
Rev. Joseph Gleason Pronounces an
Interesting Homily in St.
Francis Church.
The feast of the Holy Name was
solemnly commemorated yesterday in St.
Ignatius Church. A solemn high mass
was celebrated by the Rev. Edward Allen,
S. J., who was assisted by fathers of the
Society of Jesus. Biga's sublime mass
was sung in ilfl entirety by the male choir,
the solos being taken by Dr. J. J. Morri
sey, Mr. Rowan, L. Berger and G. "Wood.
His Grace Archbishop Riordan de
livered an eloquent sermon on the feast
and the gospel of the day.
In the haDdsome chapel of the Gentle
men's Sodality an interesting ceremony j
took place. The chapel had been beauti
fully frescoed and illuminated with many
new electric lamps, and when mass was
celebrated at 7:30 a. m. by Father Fried
man, S. J., the sanctuary presented a bril
liant spectacle. The |pelebrant was as
sisted by the Rev. Joseph Hickey, S. J.,
spiritual director of the sodality, and
Father Friedman preached to the mem
bers.

Rev. Joseph Gleason preached before a
large congregation at St. Francis Church
last evening on the gospel of the day, the
second Sunday after Epiphany, St.John
ii, 1-11. He said that this gospel hae been
interpreted the most widely perhaps of
all gospels of the liturgical year. It tells
of the marriage feast at Canaan.
At the marriage of Canaan the Savior
and his apostles were invited; but it was
a wedding among poor Deople, and evi
dently the groom acted hastily in inviting
too many guests, for the wine ran out.
Here the Blessed Virgin nhowed her ten
derness; she went to her divine son and
said: "The wine is running out." She
appealed to him in the most human way
possible, not that she sought him to per
form a miracle, but that he would find
some tactful way out of the difficulty.
Then in the little towns aDout Nazareth
Jesus was regarded as a man of fine sense,
as the son of the carpenter, of Mary. But
he was unkown in his divine character.
St. Luke says that from the time Jesus
returned from the Temple to Nazareth he
lived with his mother and was subject to
her. When she told him at this marriage
that that the wine was running out, he
said to her: "Woman, what is that to
me and to thee; my time has not yet
come." This expression has been quoted
in the face of the Christian world that
here Christ insulted his motherâ the
grossest interpretation possible. For im
mediately after be asked for jars of water
and turned them into wine. The words
cannot have the meaning of insult to his
mother. What then meant these words?
He could explain to her that his time
for performing miracles had not yet ar
rived at that exact minute. The expres
sion, "What is it to me and to thee?" is
Hindoo; it was understood by those who
heard the Savior use it, but they saw in it
no insult.
The Savior's parables were illustrations
of his moral doctrines, taken from the
daily life of the people of his days. The
Hindooism cannot be translated correctly
into our language, and the literal transla
tion is harsher in our ears than its real
meaning. The expression is notan insult,
because this orientalism was used in every
day life with courtesy. As to the word
"woman," in the Hebrew language it is
the highest term of respect that can be
paid a female, even more than "mother."
Jesus never called the Blessed Virgin
"mother," bat "woman." One of the
most scholarly of Protestant commenta
tors of the Scriptures gives the free trans
lation of Christ's words as: "Mother,
leave that to me; my time has not yet
come,"

Seven Highway Bills Be
fore the Present Leg
islature.
The Work of the State Improve
ment Committee of the
L. A. W.
Excellent Recommendations of the
State Bureau of Highways
Just Issued.
One of the most important questions
coming before the public at the present
time is that of roads â "good roads," as
the wheelmen who are moving mightily
in the matter designate it. "With them
is working the Bureau of Highways, which
have just issued a report upon the thor
oughfares of the State. One can under
stand how much care is expended annu
ally upon roads when it is known that
exclusive of the sums spent on the streets
of cities, towns and even many villages
nearly 12,000,000 was used in repairs on
the highways of California during the
fiscal years of 1894 and 1895. During the
eleven years from 1885 to 1895 such data
a3 could be gathered from the records of
the. various county officials shows that,
not including privfete subscriptions of
money, labor and material and poll tax
paid for generally in labor previous to
1893, and cost of construction of bridges,
etc., the highway expenditures reached
the enormous sum of $18,000,000.
Even with this great outlay It is well
known to those familiar with any fraction
of the mileage of the roads of the State
that they are deplorably bad. As a cause
of this the bureau points out that the
work has been carried on without method
or system, and the money injudiciously
expended. To start with, the roads have
been located without regard to the typog
raphy of the country. In numberless in
stances highways have been laid out over
rolling and hill land, around corners or
through boggy and poorly drained acres,
to the permanent detriment of public
rights and convenience.
The bureau insists upon the intro
duction of the requirement that roads
must be located upon the best grades and
alignments which the nature of the coun
try will permit Considering that the
roÃds are the lines along which, for all
time, must be moved the traffic of a
growing civilization, this principle should
be imperatively enforced.
The report also calls attention to the
natural conditions, climatic, geological
and typographical, favorable to road con
struction. The absence of severe winters,
which work such injury to the highways
in many Eastern States, the presence of
abundant building and repairing material
and the character of the ground surface
in the valleys and through mountain
passes make good roads possible, perma
nent and plentiful all over the State.
So strong a hold has the good-road ques
tion taken upon the public that seven
bills for the improvement of highways will
go before the present Legislature, all of
which will undoubtedly pass. The sub
ject has been treated favorably in the
Governor's message, and a large majority
in the Senate and Assembly is desirous
that the bills should become laws.
The proposed enactments were drawn
up by the Highway Improvement Com
mittee of the League of American Wheel
men, which organization ia actively en
gaged in the highway work with the great
National League for Good- Roads.
One of the bills calls for a regulation
width of wagon tires. This was recom
mended by the State Bureau, and pre
acribed that three inches for wheels of
ordinary iarm and road wagons, and the
minimum width of four inches for tires
bearing loads between four and six tons;
tires of live inches for loads between six
and eight tons, and for loads over eight
tons a tire-width of six inches.
Charles G. Michener, chairman of the
committee, states that the most impor
tant bill is that for the establishment of a
system of State highways, and that one
fourth of a mill on each dollar of taxation
be set apart for the construction and re
pair of roads.
This wili take the matter out of tha
hands of the Supervisors of the counties
and bring about a State system for the
maintenance of the public highways. Mr.
Michener also states that the bicycle-bag
gage bill will pass with flying colors, as
the railroads will not oppose the measure.
Those transportation companies readily
understand that this privilege granted
wheelmen will encourage them to patron
ize the passenger trains; whereas, if the
biker weie charged freight on his ma
chine he would in many cases ride It in
stead of paying for its transportation.
This would mean the loss of many a fare,
and with good roads throughout the
country hardly' a wheel would ever go
into the baggage-car.
A man weighs less when the barometer
is high, notwithstanding the fact that the
atmospheric pressure on him is more than
when the barometer ia low. As the pres
sure of air on an ordinary-sized man is
about fifteen tons the rise of the mercury
from twenty-nine inches to thirty-one
inches adds about one ton to the load he
has to carry.
LABOR LAWS ARE
WELL REGARDED
Some Favorable Reports
Received From Sac
ramento.
Proposed Labor Bills That Have
Passed the Second
Reading.
Convention of Union Men Discuss
the Various Measures in Which
They Are Interested.
The California Labor Convention met
yesterday at 915J^ Market street to hear
reports on the tight for new labor laws
now being waged at Sacramento and to
keep up interest in the struggle. James
Rose occupied the chair.
Credentials were presented by Frank
Cooke of the Sacramento Labor Conven
tion and the Sacramento Book-binders'
Union, J. D. Campbell of the Carpenters'
and Joiners' tJnion No. .22 of San Fran
cisco, Louis F. Keeber of the Journeymen
Bakers' and Confectioners' Union, Henry
Carstensen of the Amalgamated Wood
workers' Union and C. N. Moreno of the
Sacramento Typographical Union, all of
whom were seated in the convention.
Delegate Macarthur of the Sailors'
Union, who was appointed a committee of
one to represent the convention at the
capital, reported on the various bills pre
pared by the State Labor Bureau and re
vised by the San Francisco Labor Conven
tion. He said that ail the bills had been
presented to the Legislature in both
houses and six of them acted on by the
Committee on Labor and Capital of the
Assembly.
Assembly bill No. 17, entitled, "An act
fixing the minimum rate of compensation
for labor on public work," making the
figure $2 a day, had passed its second
reading and was going to the third or
final reading.
The bill to establish a bureau of labor
(No. 44 in the Assembly) had its title al
tered by the addition ot "and to appro
priate money therefor," instead of leav
ing it to the discretion of the Labor Com
missioner to establish bureaus whereso
ever he pleases. Los Angeles and ban
Francisco are named as the ilaces for
labor bureaus. A section was introduced
providing for voluntary arbitration in
labor disputes, and the Dill was further
amplified, but it was not recommended,
and consequently is as if it had not been
introduced.
Assemmbly bill No. 80, providing for
the employment of citizens of the United
Btattes upon public works within the
State, was reported favorably, and the au
thority to decide citizenship was given to
the Labor Commissioner.
Sanford of Point Arena introduced a
bill providing for a limit of ten hours for
a day's labor in logging camps and Baw
mills. Thla bill has been favorably re
ported.
Some difficulty was met in getting any
one to introduce the bill providing for the
examination of steam boilers because it
wr3 technical and not intelligible to the
laymen of tne Legislature. Mr. Mac
arthur urged that it would take consid
erable pushing in the committee by engi
neers Interested in its passage.
With regard to the bond fo r public
works, several measures conceding it
have been introduced, providing fora bond
for the protection of laborers. Mocarthur
suggested that the amount of the bond
should amount to one-half of the contract
price, instead of the whole, as offered by
the convention. He therefore recom
mended that this matter be reconsidered
by the convention.
Bills have been introduced changing
Labor day from October 1 to September 1,
abolishing poll and road tax, exempting
seamen's and fishermen's wages from at
tachment, but the last one was laid aside.
Several schemes are on hand to disrupt
the Btate Printing Office, and a bill has
been brought up to furnish free textbooks
for the public schools.
An act providing a lunch hour for em
ployes was dropped, as it was not re
garded as a constitutional measure.
Macarthur concluded by stating that
everything seems favorable to the labor
bills, and everybody at Sacramento was
friendly to the movement. The Sacra
mento Federated Trades is doing every
thing possible for the success of these bills.
The bakers' bill has been introduced in
both houses, but it has not yet come up in
the committee. All the other billa will
likely come up in committee during this
week.
Resolutions were adopted declaring that
the movement for a department of labor
in California is not a party measure, and
the convention adjourned.
CITIZENS' MEETING.
Proposed Labor Laws Indorsed In
the Socialists' Hall.
A meeting of about 250 people was held
in the old temple at 115 Turk street yes
terday afternoon. It was opened by J. W.
Rose, who introduced George Lafayette,
president of the United Bricklayers'
Union, as chairman.
A committee presented the following
resolution, which was adopted:
Sesolved, That we, the unclersignod citizens
of San Francisco, indorse the "proposed labor
laws" recommended by the State Labor Com
missioner ana presented before the State
Legislature of California, to immediately re
lieve, assist and protect the suffering unem
ployed by passing the "labor laws" as recom
mended by tne State Labor Commissioner,
particularly Assembly bill 44, "An act to es
tablish and support a department of labor and
appropriate money therefor," and Assembly
bill 150, "An act to define the dmies and lia
bilities of employment agents," which we de
sire passed verbatim.
The committee reported that a petition
with 12,000 signatures would be taken by
the Labor Commissioner to Sacramento
for presentation to the Senate committee
to-night, asking for favorable considera
tion of the proposed laws.
Speeches were made by E. D. Laynet,
Mrs. Cafe, Geor-e Speed, E. Berg, C. H.
holcomb, George L-ifayette and others.
CHECK-RAISERS.
Ingenious Methods Used by Swindlers
to Accomplish Thoir Purposes.
The recent arrest of the ringleaders of
regular check raising and forging syndi
cates has been a revelation to the public,
but has made generally known a state of
affairs of which bankers and secret service
men have been aware for many years.
The Government offered a reward many
years ago for a writing ink which could
not be removed by acids or other chemi
cals. There were hundreds of inks offered
and not one of them met the require
ment. Those that actually were indelible
wore worthless for writing and would not
flow, while the best of those that would
flow were only indelible when allowed to
lie a long time on a porous paper.
What is True as to inK is true as to the
thousand ami one mechanical devices for
protecting commercial paper, which have
been put upon the market. There are
four or five tirms in New York alone
which have made from $1,000,000 to $4,000,
--000 each by the manufacture and sale of
articles of this kind, not one of which but
has. been "beaten" scores of times, and
not one of which is of the slightest value
except as against the efforts of the merest
tyros in the check-raising industry.
So profitable has become the forging
and check-raising industry that capital
ized syndicates have deliberately engaged
in it and have stolen great sums in an in
credibly short time.
Carelessness in making out checks is, of
course, a fruitful Bounce of crime, as in
many instances the possibility of making
a safe alteration is glaringly before the
eye. This temptation has brought many
a young man to ruin, but the losses from
this sotirce are trifling compared with
those from the regular professional check
raisers. These gentry have an equipment
of tools and chemicals as complete in their
way as the tools used by burglars, and the
manufacture of these articles, especially
for criminal purposes, is quite as exten
sive as is the manufacture of burglars'
tools.. The outfit consists of three or four
kinds of acid* for removing inks; all the
various cutting machines U3ei for cutting
out figures in the body of .the check, a
device at one time supposed to be invul
nerable, bat one of tne easiest of all to
beat; a complete supply of twenty differ
ent kinds of delicate brushes and a palette
of artists' colors.
These colors and brushes are used to re
store the lines in tinted paver after the tint
has been taken out by tne acid used in re
moving the Ink. Great sums of money, by
the way, have been spent in the manufac
ture of this tinted paper â money entirely
thrown away, as the knaves have processes
which restore the tint wherever their
operations may have destroyed it and re
store it so perfectly as to utterly defy de
tection.
Tne nippers are used especially to beat
the figures out of the checfc or draft by the
various machines made for that purpose.
"With the nippers, which are curiously and
delicately pointed, the minutest particle of
paper can be picked up and deftly handled.
The width of the figure ia measured, and
then the expert knows, provided he does
not recognize it at a glance, which he gen
erally does, just exactly what machine cut
it. With his own corresponding machine
he cuts the same figure from the same kind
of paperâ for a stock of every variety of
paper used is part of his equipment â and
tills in the cut-out figures by the aid of
the nippers and his materials for dressing
and hardening down the surface after his
work is done.â New York World.
CREMATION GETTING POPULAR.
The Prejudice Against Incineration
Disappearing.
Cremation , as a means of disposing of
the bodies of the dead, when first tried in
New York State on December 4, 1885, at
tracted a great deal of attention, and
there was also considerable discussion as
to the relative merits ol the new method
as compared to the usual custom of un
derground burial. Many people were
superstitious regarding incineration.
People were at first loath to give consent
to this disposition of the bodies of their
friends and relatives. Those who favored
the new method urged its adoption, giv
ing as their reason for the change that it
was cleaner, cheaper, and did away with
the necessity of elaborate funerals. It was
also urged that the incineration of bodies
of persons who had died from contagious
diseases would lessen the dangers of con
tagion and would be the eafest way in
which to dispose of such bodies. On the
other hand, the fear of burial alive caused
some strongly to advocate incineration,
says the New York Tribune.
As an aid to the adoption of the new
method, indorsements were secured from
ministers and from others, in which they
say there was nothing unscriptural in dis
posing of the dead by means of fire, and
advocating the method as more cleanly
than burial.
The firat incineration in New York
State was at the New York Fresh Pond
CeTietery, on Long Island, facing the
Luiheran Cemetery, jnst north of Fresh
Fond station, on the Long Island rail
road. This was on December 4, 1885,
Since that time, despite assertions by
some to the contrary, incineration has
grown in popularity, and it is said that
there is an increase of fifty incinerations
a year. The number of cremations at
Fresh Pond up to the beginning of the
present year is given as 188 L.
â  Of this number 1213 bodies were those of
men, 98 of boys, 496 of women and 73 were
the bodies of girls. Thirty -five dollars is
charged for the incineration of a body.
This charge is only for the mere consum
ing of the body by means of heat, the
body being placed in an airtight compart
ment of an immense furnace. Enough
ashes are left to fill a small-sized urn. It
takes several hours to dispose of a body,
after which the ashes are collected and
placed in an urn which has previously
been purchased. Often the ashes are
taken away by friends and at other times
they are deposited in alcoves in the walls
of the columbarium where the body has
been incinerated. By the request of
friends endeavoring to carry out the pe
culiar wishes of the departed the ashes
are often taken and thrown to the four
winds.
There is a charge for the door whicn is
placed in front of the niche. Tne urns
may be bought for from $9 50 up to $45,
while the niche in the wall costs from $15
to $25, according to its location in the wall.
To the cost of the incineration, whicn is
$35, must be added the coit of the urn for
the a^hes and the niche for the reception
ol the urn. When the body is borne to
the columbarium in carriages there is ex
tra charge, according to the number of car
riages brought into service. Witn this
method there is no necessity for the pur
chase of a burial lot, although many peo
ple bury the ashes. The maximum cost
for incineration, including the purchase of
an urn, the leasing of a niche to receive
the urn, the door of the niche, and all ex
penses, not including the hire of car
riages, does not exceed $125 or $150 at most.
POLICE OF TWO CITIES.
London* Deal With Burglars and Those
of Paris With Murderers.
Some interesting comparisons have been
made between the police of London and
those of Paris in connection witn the an
nual report for the year 1895 issued from
Scotland Yard. In the first place it has
been ascertained that the London consta
bles cost less than that the Paris sergeants
de vilie, or agents, although they are one
third more numerous and have to deal
with a more extensive population. The
London Metropolitan Police, for instance,
are supposed to patrol an extent of terri
tory larger than PariÂ«, with the extramu
ral boroughs of Si. Cloud, Meudon and
Sevres included.
The Paris "sergots," as the criminals
call them, arrest annually about 267 mur
derers or perpetrators of bloodthirpty
assaults, whereas in London there were
only an average of eighteen cases of ac
complished or attempted assassination in
a year. In the matter of burglary, how
ever, London eclipses Paris. The great
British metropolis harbors a small army
of housebreakers, who in general do suc
cessful work, while the housethieves on
the French side of the channel are fre
quently handicapped by the doorkeepers.
The figures from the Scotland Yard re
port show that during 1895 there were
2625 cases of burglarious entry into
houses and shops. For the same period
in Paris there has been an average of 979
burglaries.
Struck by Meteors.
Somebody has said it is rather curious
that in view of the number of meteorites
that fall to the earth every year no one
has ever been killed or hurt by one. This
is a mistake. In the year 616 a meteoric
stone fell in China, shattering a cart and
killing ten men. It may bo asserted that
the population of the Mongolian empire
is so dense that it would be difficult to
miss a Chinaman. But other countries
have known similar accidents. About the
close of the seventeenth century a Cap
tain "Willmann reported that two of his
sailors were killed at sea by the fall of a
nine-pound meteorite. Not long after
this a monk was killed near Milan in the
same way, wniie a meteor which fall near
New Concord in 1860 broke a railroad tie
in two.
BOLCE COMBATS
TIE OLD THEOLOGY
The Reporter Preacher
Pleads for Natural
Religion.
Opposes the Formalism of Creeds
and Urges a Return to
Theism.
He Offers a Flan to Make the Religion
of Humanity Take the Place of
All Others.
Rev. Harold Bolce, formerly a newspa
per reporter and lately founder of the Cos
mopolitan Church, preached at Metropol
itan Temple last night on "The Religion
of Humanityâ A Substitute for Theol
ogy."
The discourse was somewhat combative
and critical of old creeds and the speaker's
plea throughout was tor a return to pure
theism and tor confidence in human des
tiny. He said :
"The laughter of a child and the song of
a bird are as sacred as the solemnities of
theology. We need a return to primitive
ideals and we must learn to worship in
nature's cathedral.
"i do not believe much in sermons as
such. The world needs but to be re
minded of its duty. We want to preach
the old gospel of God, the same that was
sung in the Vedic humus and among the
old shepherds of the Holy Land. This re
ligion is older than the apostles."
The following excerpts are a sample
of the new minister's ideas:
"Every church has certain spiritual
ideals to which it aspires and certain re
ligious traditions which it labors to have
humanity espouse. All that is beautiful
in these aspirations and memories enlists
our sympathy, just as that which is fun
damentally good and true appeals to all
cultivated and liberal minds.
"But with these teachings have been
retained theologic symbols, sacerdotal
form 9of worship and anthropomorphic
conceptions of God. which have served a
great purpose in the development of hu
manity, but which are no longer necessary
as spiritual helps to enlightened religious
souls.
"We do not reject the old-time symbols
in a hostile sense, but in the same spirit
in which we put aside the abacus and
other nursery adjuncts when we enter
higher schools of learning.
"Upon this old theology, with its fables,
its incredible prodigies, its limiting beliefs
in God and man, and all its fantastic and
poetic mlraculism â a childlike theology
that nas thrilled and satisfied humanity
in the kindergarten age of man's develop
ment â we look back musingly, lovingly,
just as we conjure to memory the toy
wonders, the wooden heroes, and all the
bewildering imaginings of childhood, or
revol in the imagery of Greek or Norse
mythology."!

OF CALIFORNIA
The commander -in - chief, Governor]
Buiid. Adjutant-General Barrett and Brig
adier-General 'Wartield were in consulta
tion for some time in this City on Satur
day morning, and it was with a view to
call out the members of the guard on what
is known as "emergency call, 1 ' for the !
purpose of finding out what proportion of
the men could be found at the armories
and ready for duty upon short notice.
The day was chosen because Governor
Bndd had declared it a legal holiday, but
the clerk of the weather, who is no re
specter of legal holidays on short notice,
or of the scheme to turn the men out on
the hurry-me-quirk plan, interposed an
objection in the shape of a heavy drizzle
anil occasional showers. There being no
sicn of clearing up at noon, the heads of
the National Guard held another meeting
and decided to declare the emergency call
off on account of the weather.
About ten days ago one of the local pa
pers announced that one of the Assembiy
men had introduced a bili in the House
at Sacramento having for its object the
reorganization of the National Gaurd and
placing certain officers, who would be of- j
finally decapitated, on the retired list.
The purpose of the bill, as one could re<B
between the lines making the announce
ment in print, was the removal 01 Major-
General .lame?. Since the publication ef
forts have been made to rind a copy of that
bill, bui without success, and the ones in
Sacramento who oueht to know appear to
be entirely oblivious as to Us existence.
It may be that some one of the legislators
Las such a bill to offer and has not yet
done so.
The resignation of Colonei McDonald is |
Mil! (he subject of talk in <ri:ard circles, '
but the fact i hat he has tendered his res- j
ignation and that it has been accepted has i
not yet officially been made known, ana
until it is. no election can be called to
choose his successor.
There appears 10 be no one who
will oppose the promotion ot Lieutenant-
Colonel Duboce, .-i.id it also appears at
this time as if he wi.l continue in com
mand of the First Infantry, Second Bri
gade, having practically been the head of
the regiment 'or many months.
The inflowing orders nave been issued
in the matter of the inquiry into the af

Notwithstanding the little matter of an
inquiry, the troop is going right along, i
and as they say in beneficiary organiza
tions, "taking in new members all the
time." On last Wednesday night nine |
men whose wames had been favorably re- [
ported on by the recruiting committee '
were elected, and the names ol sixteen j
more were presented and turned over to j
the committee for investigation. The {
name nicht Private Waiter Woodward ;
Price, at one time a member of Squalron j
A, N. G.. of the State of New York, '
was elected firt lieutenant of the i
troop, and First Sergeant W. Penniman !
was elected .second lieutenant, the vote in j
each case beiniz unanimous.
At the meeting of C mid G Companies, !
First Infantry, Second Rngade. held last i
Monday, the medals won by ruemDers at '
the Siate shoot were distributed. The '
championship medal went 10 Private j
Chris Meyer; first-class to Lieutenant C '
E. Goodeh, second-clas- to Sergeant W. !

the fourth-class to Private Peter Bull, j
After that there was a distribution to the
members of eighty prizes that were <on
tributed by friends 01 the companies, to
be contested for at the company shoots.
Captain Marshall, drill-master of the
local police lorce, wants to be major in the

At the annual meeting of the boarri of
officers of the First InfHntry, Second Bri
tade, held hist Thursday, nothing wasdone
eyond the announcement that Colonel
McDonald bad resigned and the discus
sion of possible bills which may be intro
duced in the House or Senate to change
the status of the National Gu.trd. The
consensus ol opinion as expressed at the
meeting was that the guard does not need
reorganization at this time, but that it
does need assistance to place it on a bet
ter footing.
Third Brlg.de.
SACRAMENTO, Cal , Jan. 15.â There
has been a very fair attendance at drill
during the past week among the local
companies of the National Guard in this
city, but as yet they have not fairly re
covered from their month of rest, and are
by no means well up in Doint of attend
ance and drill. Company E turned out ss
strong last nitrht, and went through the
mual drill in body movements and man
ual exercise. This company is desirous to
match twenty to twenty- five men, in a
lifty iibot to the man contest, with any
company in the State for a supper, ths
companies to exchange targets and to mu
tually agree upon inspectors, elc. They
have admi:tcd a number of new members
and have other applications on file, which
will be acted on immediately.
The cavalry troop has also returned to
their drills and are niso coming into form
rapidly. They are preparing for a field
day to" be held in the near future, and are
more than anxious to be Bupphea with
regulation carbines in order that they may
improve at tho butts.
Company G turned out fifty-four men at
drill on Monday night and practiced at
Davonet exercise and company move
ments. They have elected a new shoot
ine committpe, consis-tinar of Corpora!-
Ullery Â»nd Miliiken au<i Privates Aine,
Stripling and Peters, who will formulate
plans to bring the exppnsesof target prac
tice within â  !ie amount allowed' by Cap
tain Sterns for that par pose, and will en
deavor to stimulate enthusiasm in the
shooting line by offering suitable medals
for competition. They are also empow
ered to procure erounds on which to erect
300 and 500 yard ranges and have been
pi need in charge of the target?, etc.
Armorer Phil Cook is greatly exercised
in mind over this matter, as he claims
that in case of war with Spain or any
other foreign power the members of
the company will stana but little chance
of being included in the ranks of the
stmrpshooting element unless practice is
begun immediately.
The favorite of the company. Quarter
master Kline, has become a benedict, and
ihÂ» members of G claim that they head
the list of ail the companies in the State
in the number of married men in the
rank:-, possessing at the present time
twenty-nine, with numerous others in
picspective.
Considerable indignation exists against
headquarter* because of objections which
have been stated against the companies
using any surplus which may accrue,
:ifter payment of rents, etc., from their
$100 per month State allowance in the
purchase of ammunition witb which to
improve at the butts; and there are many
of the enlisted men who openly declare
that they will not re-enlist again owing to
this regulation which the adjutant-yen
eral's office is endeavoring to enlorce. They
claim that they should be allowed to ex
pend their surplus a* they please as long
as they settle all bills and keep t eir
company stock up in shape. They say
that at present the greatest need of the
companies is to improve in their rifle
practice and they think t iat the adjutant
general's office should not object to their
claims, or rather vouchers for money ex
pended for ammunition, which they
claim has been done.
The company commanders in this City
are in lavor of having a sufficient amount
appropriated by the Legislature for en
campment purposes, so that the mon can
be paid at the rate of $2 per day wiiile in
camp and do iheir own cooking, etc.
They claim that the majority of the men
are "working men to wnom it is an object
not to iose a day's employment and that
they frhould be partially reimbursed while
out on Stale work. Here:ofore it has been
customary when holding encampments to
hire waiters, cooks, etc., but it is thought
that encampments should be a<< near ac
tual service as possible: men to ereciMheir
own tents, cook their own provision * by
messes, and in all ways conform to active
service duty. It iÂ» greatly desired to hear
trie expressions of the other captains of
companies throughout the State on this
subject.
Signal tVrps, Third Brigade.
During the month of December the sig
nal corps of the Third Brigade took its
annual "lay-off." They ushered in the
Curistmas month in a most becoming
manner by giving their rirat annual ball
on the evening of Tuesdsy, December 1.
The dance was a most elaborate affair, be
ing held in Armory Hall, which was
beautifully decorated for the occasion
with bunting, flags and flowers. The
walls on each side of the hall were dec
orated with the crossed flags of the signal
corps and between the galleries and chan
deliers streamers of bunting and flans of
every color ur.d description were strung in
pleasing profusion. Neale's Orchestra,
which was placed on tne stage, was em
bowered in a mass of potted palms, ferns
and other evergreens and added very
much to the enjoyment of the occasion by
playine a number of extra concert pieces.
The officers' quarters were open and a
little extra collation was served to the old
â¢'w.-ir-horses" present, among wdom were
Colonel Peeler, Colonel Guthrie, Major
Wallace, Major and Signal Officer Dougias
and other general and commissioned offi
cers of the National Guard. A large bowl
of punch, Mnother of lemonade and cakes
and sandwiches were dispensed to the
dancers in the hall.
The grand march was led by Major
Douglas ana Mrs. Colonel Peeler, while
the colonel himself, who was at the time
suffering from a severe sprain occasioned
by being thrown from his horse, had to
content himself by wafching the dances
from the gallery. The committee on ar
rangements, to wlioiu much credit is due
for the success of the affair, consisted of
Sergeant Watkins and Corporals Byrne
and Roblin. "When the "Home Sweet
Home" waltz was over, many happy
couples said to one another that Lieuten
ant Martin's command hall '"done them
selves proud," and went home with the
intention of meeting the Signal Corps
ag tin.
The terms of Sergeants Bailey and Mar
tin have expired, but, as they are most in
timately connected with the corps, they
will probably r -enlist.
Lieutenant Martin is at present out of
town on a trip for hiÂ« firm through Placer
and El Dorado counties. On account of
his absence the annual meeting of the
corps, for the election of civil officers and
nppointment of committees, was post
poned till January 12.
Trie reuular annual meeting of the S g
nal Corps, Third Brigade, was held on the
evening of Tuesday, the 12th inst. The
reports of the treasurer (Lieutenant Mar
tin), the first sergeant (Bailey) and the
secretary (Sergeant Watkins) were sub
mitted to the assemb.ei members. The
report of Lieutenant Martin shows the
corps to be in a much better condition
tban it ever has been before. Sergeant
Bailey's report showed the average at
tendance at drills during 1890 to have
Deen very close to 90 per cent. The secre
tary's report reviewed the work of the pre
vious year and called attention to the fact
that the signal corps of the various brig
ades had led all other branches of the
service in efficiency, personnel and gen
eral merit, according to reports of the
officers in charge of the inspection of 1896.
Tiie following committees were appointed
for the ensuing year: On exaniinaiion â
Sergeant Bailey, Sergeant Watkins, Cor
poral Taylor; on finance â Corporal Cosby,
Privates Harvey and Leitch. Sergeant
I Watkins was unanimously re-elecied sec
' retary. After the transaction of routine
business the members sat down t<> a little
"Dutch" supper provided for the occasion.
WOODLAND, Cau. Jan. 15.-Every
thing is quiet in military circles in thl%
place. Last Wednesday evening two new
members were admitted, and there are
two applications on the board to be acted
on at the next meeting. The company is
in charge of First Lieutenant Ward' at
present, Captain Prindle bein^ at Oroville
on business. A prominent business man
o, the town has promised the company a
flag; ao we may expect to see it flying
from the new flagpole in the near future.
The football team is out practicing every
day, and at night hold signal practice in
the armory. The team has a game they
practice for wind called hand football.
The ball can neither be carried nor kicked,
but must be advanced by punching or by
throwing from one to the other. The
team is anxious for some of the other
companies to get up teams and then play
a series of ganes for the championship.
The gmnd annual ball will take place
about the sth of February.
The captain has not as yet found a
place suitable ior the 300 and 500 yard

The Sixth Infantry.
MERCED. Cal., Jan. 14.â The members
of Company ri, Sixth Infantry, have set
tled down for another year's work after
the December holidays and with a deter
mination to make a showing for their
i time. A clans in the drill regulations has
'â¢ been organized, which meets on Tuesiay
evenings for study and discussion. Ser-
I geant Guthrie has charge of the class. It
will take up a study of the drillbook, sup
plemented by a tnoroueh practical drill
and practice in 'he giving of commands.
The object of the class is primarily to tit
I the students for non-commissioned posi
! tions. Later, if a sufficient number desire
j to take the course, it will be extended to
j cover tne elements of military science.
The resignation of Second Lieutenant
D. G. Banibauer nas been accepted by the
I commander-in-cliief and the election for a
successor is expected to be ordered at an
early date.
Much interest is being manifested
j BKoni; the members of the company in
! the domes of the Legislature, so tar as the
| National Guard is concernei. A member
of the company whose service in the
National Guard of this and other States
extends over a period of fifteen years said
to the correspondent the other day: "We
1 are closely watching all propositions
I brought before the Legislature on our be
! half and sincerely hope that whatever
action they make take will be tempered
with wisdom. I notice some talk of fur
ther reorganization.
"The spreading of suc'i i 'eas will not
beneht us in the least. Wa want more
encouragement and atienuon Irom our
! higher officers, and less tinkering with a
1 badly-built code. We have lately been
I reorganized, and all we need is time to
i get settled down to the new regime. Un
doubtedly there is friction in the First
Infantry; further legislation would not
| help them, but it would hurt us in the in
| lerior reg rnenis, for we always suffer from
! the scramble for offices that is always go
ing on in San Francisco. A few colonels
or general officers who would evince a
personal interest in their righting material,
| and who would stop squaobling over who
j is the senior or who has the 'puli,' would
i reorganize a system that needs it more
than legislation. The life lias nearly been
crushed out of the service by red tape
bunglingly unwound, and gilt braid pro
j fusely given here and there. regardles3 of
j military ability. Enlisted men become
j very tired of being apologized for when
ever an occasion presents itself by an
epatiletted commission-holder. If ihere
is to beany chanire o! law this session,
I no hing couid be better than the proposed
â â  changes embodied in the report of the
i Code Commi-sion."
A TRUE SOLDIER.
Although r.ii.llv Shot Up, He Was True
to the Old i'lag
A visit from Norman S. Bull, clerk of
t{ie Circuit Court for Crawford County, re
minded me of a war incident well worth
telling. At the battle of the Wilderness,
in 1864, Sergeant Bull was shot in the
face, the bullet passing from one cheek to
the other, tearing off his upper jaw, or so.
nearly that it hung by a brittle thread, as
it were. He walked off the field and in
due time brought up at a Washington
hospital, remaining there until Septem
ber, or four months, when he returned to
his regiment for duty.
A silver plate had been adjusted to take
the place of the upper jaw, but it was
painful and worked but poorly. Captain
Thomas Kerr, later lieutenunt-colonel,
was commanding the regiment, and he
said to Bull: "For the love of all that's
good, Sergeant Bull, w.. at are you back
uere for?"'
"Oh, I came back to go on duty, cap
tain." Then a happy thought struck the
captain, and he asked: "Look here, how
would you JiktÂ» to be division commis-ary
sergeant? You would have plenty of time
there to soak your hard bread and to cook
pancakes."
"I guess I'd like that. Can you get it
for me?"
"I'll try."
Then Captain Kerr rode over to brigade
headquarters and proceeded to business,
after this fashion:
"General, Sergeant Bull has come back.
As you know, bis mouth is all shot to
pieces. He can't tear cartridges any
more, and to eat hardtack is out of the
question. Can you pet him in as commis
sary-sergeant at division headquarters? '(|
The general squinted, after the fashion
when a question that he takes deep in
terest in comes up betore him, and said:
'"Tom"â be always called Colonel Kerr
"Tom" when he didn't call him
"Chicken"â "Tom, Sergeant Bull is as
good v soldier ay the old regiment ever
had. Few men would have come back in
his condition. I think you ought to
recommend him for a commission. He
will get along some way with his rations
if we c<in relieve him from cartridge-tear
ing."
That afternoon a letter left camp signed
by Captain Thomas Kerr, commanding
the regiment, requesting that Sergeant
Norman S. Bull I>j commissioned a lieu
tenant.
Two or three weeks later the commis
sion came and he served the balance of
the war, or up to Gravelly Run, as an offi
cer. He was wounded at Hatcher's Run
in February and again at Gravelly Run
the last day of March. He was shot five
times, and three of the wounds were seri
ous ones. Those in his face made him a
irreat sufferer for eighteen years, and re
quired so much attention, so much medi
cal skill, that it used up nearly everything
{ lie had. It cost tiie lieutenant something
i to keep Old Glory in the breeze, but he
says that if he "had 1000 lives he'd rather
see them â¢ .Id down than to see that flap
come down 1.1 disgrace." â Chicago Times-

! The management of the affair for the Ha
| waiian team has been unanimously placed
I in the hands of Lieutenant-Colonel Fisher,
| not only because he is one of ihe best
siiOts in the regiment, but because of his
well-known interest in such matters, and
his knowledge of the men in his com

According to present arrangements the

more or less faithfully at tlie butts during
the past month to see who is to have the
honor of getting a place on the team
which is to represent triese little flyspecks

There are ninety-ihree men in the fore
going list, and two average scores made
by them foot up 3996 :md respectively,
which will give California marksmen an
idea of what they have to beat. Company
A. does not possess many good shots, be
ing composed mainly of men working on
the Government dredger. Company B
is represented in the team by ten men. ail
good shots. Company C is com
posed mostly of Portuguese and has
but a very few good shots. Com pan v D
has twenty representatives in the team,
the largest of any company, out of whom
the best marksmen are Burnette and
Johnson, both sale forty-four men. Com
pany E has some srood shots or Colonel
Fisher would not have selected seventeen
men from v ior his team. There are also
some tine shots among t> c seventeen men
selected from Company F. Company Gis
composed mostly of native Hawaiians,
their best shot being Sergeant Rose with
forty-two.
In an interview with Colonel Fisher
that gentleman told The Call correspond
ent, in response 10 a question as to what
he thought of Hawaii's chances in the
coming match, that he thought the isl
anders would win, although it would be
by a very narrow margin. "I rely on our
general average," said the colonei. "While
we have no phenomenal shots like the
California team, still we may make a bet
ter showing."
AT SCHUETZEN PARK.
A Lively Competition for Twenty-
Five Cash Prizes Presented by
Captain F. Schumann.
Shooting began earlier Ihnn usual at
Schuetzen Park yesterday. A representa
tive body of marksmen lineal up in front
of the Grutli ranges soon after 9 o'clock to
take part in the first grand prize-shooting
contest of the new year*, which is held
periodically under the auspices of F.
Schumann, the park proprietor.
Something like $150 was offered in cash
prizes, ranging all the way from $25 to $1.
There were twenty-nine prizes in all.
With the exception of forty- nve min
utes' intermission at midday, firing was
continued without ceasing until 5:30
p. M., when the rapidly waning light made
it necessary to close the ranges.
Four shots were allowed per man at the
twenty-tive-ring target and the rules of
the Caliiornia Schuetzen Club governed
the contest. Following are the prize
winners and their re.-pective scores:

The hrst monthly uiedal shoot of the
San Francisco Turner Sehuetzeu was ren
dered memorable by a close and spirited
contest for supremacy between J. Utschig
and Ptiiio Jacoby. The former led his op
ponent until 6 P. M. with a score of 420
rings, but Jacoby eventually emerged a
winner by one ring. Following are the
scores:
Champion classâ l, I'hilo Jacoby, 421; 2,
J. r.scnig, 420. First classâ l, Fred Kommer,
364; 2, Joseph Straub, 350. Second oiuss â 1,

330. Third class â Joseph Uassner, 320. First
iM--i shot, F. Kommer, 24; last best shot, L.
Tnlerbach, 25.
The result of the same club's annual
medal snooting for the past year was as
follows:
Champion class, John Utschig; first class, L.
Thierlmch; second class, L. Bruue; third class,
Henry Stleber; first b.*st snot, R. Finking; last

MILITARY MARKSMEN.
First and Fifth Regiment Musket
Shots at the Shell Mound
Ranee,
There was a fair representation of
marksmen at the Shell Mound rifle range
yesterday, but they were all of the mili
tary order. During most of the day the
lijiht was bright; too bright, in fact, to be
satisfactory, for it frequently caused a
blur on the sights anl bullseyes.
Companies A and F of the Fifth Kegi
ment were well represented and the shoot
ing was up to the average. It is said that
the marksmen of the Fifth have placed a
chip upon the regiment's shoulder, so to
speak, which they would lilce to see the
best men of the First knock off. before
the last team shoot of the First's crack
team of 100 men, which took place last
Sunday in the inter-republic match with
the Hawaiian National Guard, the best
shots of the Filth stated that they would
like to meet the pick of the First, pro
vided the latter did not go over 40 average.
As the average was less than that num
ber of points the men of the Fifth believe
that they are in a position to meet or
equal terms the regiment that has put
forth so many good musket shots in the.
past. Arrangements lor a team mate; be
tween the two regiments may be made
beiore very Ion;:.
Possibly with such an event in view the
men of Companies A and F were out to
warm up mure than usual yesterday. Of
course the more experiences marksmen
held their own, and more than this, they
put in more time coaching the lesser
lights in marksmanship. The scores of
i the two companies in their monthly medal
shoot*, ten shots, military target, were as
follows:

The attendance at the regular monthly
contests for medals of the City Guard,
Company B, was as good as usual. As a
rule this company has a full representa
tion at every contest and tue scores taken
as a whole are above the average. Those
made yesterday were all *ood. but no
very brilliant performances mariced the
event. The scores were as follows:
Company H, City Guards First Regimentâ
H. C. Taylor 42, C. Lin dicker 39, C. Pinn 44.
G. Heizman 40, G. Sullivan -14, J. R Wear 40,

For several weeks there has been a pri
vate match brewing among lour of the
better shots of the City Guards (Company
B), and after the company contest yester
day the men went to work to see which
side would carry off a $50 purse, \yhich
was to go to the winners. The conditions
were that G. Claussenius ami G. Heizman
were to shoot against C. Perry and C.
Lindecker a mntcn of fifty shots* each on
equal terms. The odd feature was that
the naineÃ of the first two are George and
tiie last two Charles, and yesterday they
were spoken of as the George and Charley
teams. As seen by the annexed scores,
in strings of ten shots, totals and grand
totals, tho Georges won by six points, or
419 to 4i3 out of a possible 500:

NAME CHANGING IS COMMON.
Swedes, I.ik.- Witness in the Brain Case,
Take a New Name When They Wish.
With regard to legal and street talk on
the name or names of the helmsman of
the barkentine Herbert Fuller it is timely
and interesting to note what an authori
tative writer on Sweden says about the
custom of changing names in that coun
try. The helmsman in the Bram murder
trial is known by at least two names, Jus
tus Leopold Westberg and Charlie Brown.
He has said that he took the laiter name
because certain persons found the former
hard or inconvenient to pronounce, and
this averred change of cognomen has re
cently raised up considerable discussion if
not suspicion.
Charlie Brown's explanation is sup
ported in general by the following extract
from "Pictures of Life in Sweden." by
Mr^. Woods Baker, printed in New York
in 1894. Beginning on pace 117, her book
runs:
"You must never look askance at a
Swede in America because lie has changed
his name, even two or t.hree times, before
he has been fairly satisfied with his selec
tion. There is no shadow with him of an
alias that has left bad deeds behind it in
the old cuuntiy or the new. So the Swede
has seen men of respectability do at home,
without reproach or rebuse; so many
nobleman have done so on being en
nobled. Linnaeus became Carl yon Linne,
and Sweden borg'a father was Bishop
Swedborg.
"The frequency of the names ending in
'son' and the prevalence of some of them
create grent confusion in schools and uni
versities and even in the army and navy
among soldiers and sailors.
"The writer once heard a teacher, pre
senting himself in a house where he was a
stranger, say: 'My name is . It is my
name by accident. I took it in the semi
nary, where we were too many of the
same name and were told to ciioose an
otner for ourselves. I liked this one and
1 have kept it ever since.' * â¢ * A son
may choose a name quite different from
! his father's, or even from his brothers',
| and bring no more disgrace upon tiiem
than if, in America, he had legally
changea his name to inherit a fortune,
with some honorable cognomen annexed."

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
BubÃcribÃ to tbe carnival fund.
Let us make our frolic a â world-beater.
It is going to be a real Cabinet and not
merely a Presidential bureau.
Money voted fora monument to Senator
Baker would not be an extravagance.
This will be a good week to get bargains
if you study our advertising columns.
The Legislature has silenced the first
scandal by taking it by tbe throat in the
right way.
It was civilization that ruined the glory
of Sacramento Kiver and civilization
should restore it.
The report from Washington that Olney
manages Cleveland settles that much, but
now there is a desire to know who man
ages Olney.
A proposal in the Illinois Legislature to
fix the pay of Chicago Aldermen at $8000
a year is what may be called a boodle bill
with frills on it.
Weyler'a estimate tbat there are less
than 1000 revolutionists left in Pinar del
Rio aeems to have been abbut correct. The
others are marching on Havana.
No less than four State Legislatures are
now wrestling with the theater hat ques
tion, and all the time the girl who weari
the hat is not saying a single word.
"Whether the country will have any kind
of theory left when Cleveland goes out of
office may be doubtful, but it will cer
tainly be altogether out of condition.
Now tbat Mr. Madden has retired from
the Senatorial contest in Illinois it is an
nounced that he is not "a boodle Alder
man" but a good citizen thoroughly de
voted to civic interests.
Four years ago the Democrats had organ
ized the Legislatures in the bin States of the
Union and were busy electing Senators,
but now they are hardly able to organize
a crowd and elect what they wish to
drint.
The Georgia Legislature has refused to
pass a law making a close seasou for the
protection of possums, but as long as the
Georgians raise chickens and leave the
persimmon trees growing the possum can
look out for himself.
There is not likely to be any disappoint
ment with John Sherman as Secretary of
State. While he has never shown his
hand much in foreign affairs he Has am
ply demonstrated in Ohio politics that he
is at home in diplomacy.
The effect of Eastern weather npon the
human intellect may be estimated from
the fact thai the papers over there are
now elaborately disputing with one an
other whether women ever make good
resolutions on New Year's day.
It is said the indemnity to be demanded
by the Boers for the Jameson raid into the
Transvaal will amount to something more
than $10,000,000. and it pots without saying
that when England sees the bill she will
immediately demand arbitration.
The latest development in civil service
legislation at Washington is a bill provid
ing a pension for every member of the
service who has served for thirty-five years.
A few more reforms, and a Government
job will be a eoft snap sure enough.
During the past year there were con
structed in this country 1175 locomotives
of an average value of $10,000, and of
these 309 were exported, thus showing
that foreign countries are learning where
to come when they want tee best ma*
chinery.
The recent official report showing that
Savannah has 11,063 trees along her side
walks has led nobody to declare that the
city is in the shade. On tha contrary, it
is everywhere regarded as -a proof that her
people live in the sunlight and know how
to enjoy it.
Governor Black of New York startled
the State in his inaugural by declaring:
"In my judgment civil service reform will
work better with less starch.' 1 The state
ment i\ the more surprising because it
shows that the Governor himself has lots
of starch in him.
Boies Penrose, who at the age of 36 has
been honored by election to the United
States Senate from Pennsylvania, is said
to be a man of marked personal character
istics, so eccentric in many respects that
atone time there was much fun made of
him. But the fun-making fellows are for
gotten now.
Omaha, like so many other cities, is
straining herself at charter-making, and is
trying to devise some method to prevent
Councilmen who are going ont of office
from putting up jobs between the time of
election and the time when the new Coun
cilmen take their seats. It woald seem
from this that the average Omaha Council
man is a tough cuss.
According to President Fallon of the
O.io Fish and Game Commission the fish
in Lake Erie will be exhausted in two or
three years unless some protection is
given them. There can be no greater evi
dence of the rapacity of the Ohio man.
Let us be thankful that State is not lo
cated on the Pacific, for if it were the big
ocean would be exhausted of everything,
from Islands to shrimps, in less than a de
cade.
THE CRY OF EXTRAVAGANCE.
It is already evident that within a
comparatively short time the present
Legislature will have to face a
cry of extravagance as clamorous as
aDy which* has been raised against its
predecessors. There are already rumors
of scandals and suggestions of fraud aad
corruption spread throughout the Stale.
These rumors have a certain foundation,
and it is to the credit of the Legislature
that it Has begun the work of investigating
every ground on which such charees are
based.
It is only fair to the Legislature that the
people should give due consideration to
the cause of so-called legislative extrava
gance. Excessive expenditures by the
State have not been due wholly to indif
ference to public opinion on the part of
the legislators. Nearly all such ex pendi
tures have been supported by men outside
the Legislature and by a seeming public
opinion in various counties. The repre
sentatives of those counties, in fact, have
been often forced against their own better
judgment to support extravagant schemes.
Tne true cause and origin of legislative
extravagance is to be found in the desire
of each county to obtain more than its
share of righlful appropriations. When
Buncombe County, for example, desires a
million and seventeen dollars for some in
stitution, or proposed institution in the
county, all the good citizens of Buncombe
support the measure and insist that trie
representatives of that county shall advo
cate it and promote it by every means in
their power. These representatives soon
learn that they cannot secure the appro
priation for Buncombe unless they agree
to stand in with those who desire appro
priations for other counties. In this way
one extravagance leads to another, and as
the advocates of the various schemes gen
erally constitute a majority of all the
members of the Legislature, they carry
out their plans by a system of log-rolling.
Thus, while each one individually clamors
for economy, in the aggregate they support
extravagance, and the result is a mass cf
expenditures which constitutes a true
scandal against the State.
It is evident that the only way to attain
economy is for those who advocate it to
begin in their own counties. The repre
sentative in the Legislature from any par
ticular section should not be left to stand
alone and combat all his fellow-citizens
clamoring for big appropriations. Those
citizen 3in each county who really desire
economy and a better management of
State affairs should organize and give a
strong, earnest, resolute and publicly ex
pressed support to their delegates in re
fusing to vote for excessive appropriations
not only for other counties, but also for
his own.
It is estimated that at the present Legis
lature various State institutions will ask
appropriations for upward of a million
and a half of dollars. The representative
of every county in which these institu
tions are located will be expected to vote
for the appropriation asked by his own
county, and will be urged to combine with
the advocates of equally large appropria
tions in other counties in order to obtain
it. This being so, it is unfair to bold
members of the Legislature solely re
sponsible for such extravagance as may be
committed.
We do not mean to say the legislator 13
not in some sense personally responsible
for his action. Elected by the taxpayers
at large, he ought to represent all of them,
and not the set which is most insistent,
clamorous and aggressive. In the nature
of things, however, a representative is very
apt to mistake the loudest voice for the
voice of all. Moreover, he is reasonably
right in assuming that tbe men who
work are more effective in politics than
the men who do not work, and therefore
if he votes with the workers and 3tands in
for big appropriations he not only does
good politics, but has some show of reason
for claiming tbat be has served with fidel
ity his constituents.
The moral of the whole is that if we are
to have economy we must begin at home.
Each county must enter upon the work
of combating its own greed and limiting
its own demands upon the Btate treasury.
In no other way can we obtain economy
under our present form of government-
SACRAMENTO RIVER.
It is reported that a strong appeal will
be made from the land-owners of Sacra
mento Valley for an appropriation to
deepen the channel of the Sacramento
Eiver. This appeal should be indorsed
and strengthened by San Francisco and
the State generally. An appropriation for
such a purpose would be a benefit to all
and moreover the proposed work is one of
more than ordinary urgency.
There was a time when the Sacramento
River was navigable for deep sea vessels
a3 far as the city of Sacramento. It was
at that time not merely a mud sewer for
the interior of the State, but a great
stream furnishing facilities for transporta
tion and adding immensely to our com
mercial wealth. The work of civilization
has almost destroyed the nsefulness of the
stream for navigation, and it is only right
that civilization should repair the injury
it has done. The channel should be
dredged and the great river made as clear
as it was in the days of '49.
It is estimated by J. R. Price, chief en
gineer of the Board of Public Works, that
by the expenditure of $200,000 a dredger
could be constructed in California which
would have ample power to transfer to the
shore of the stream 8000 cubic yards of soft
mud an hour. This would enable the
work of clearing the channel to be speedily
and economically done, and an appropria-
tion for such a dredger ana for the work
of operating it would not be in any sense
of the word an extravagance or a waste of
money.
THE COST OF STRIKES.
The "Tenth Report of tha United States
Commissioner of 1/abor," the second vol
ume of whicU has just been given to the
public, contains statistics of striKes cover
ing a period of thirteen and a half years,
up to June 30, 1894. Included in these are
reports of the enormous sums to which
the losses incurred in these industrial
wars amount, and the sum is enough to
set capitalists and workmen seriously
thinking of the problem of arbitration.
The total lO3S to employes during the
period investigated by the Commissioner
is estimated at $163,807,000, which more
than doubled the loss in tha same time to
employers. The losses of both parties
added together give a total in rough num
bers of $250,000,000, and it is more than
probable that there were large losses
which could not be discovered by the Com
missioner. The cost of lockouts to em
ployers was $12,000,000, and to employes
$26,685,000, showing about the same pro
portion as in strike-, but much less in the
aggregate.
The success and failure of strikes varied
in an astonishing way in different years,
but an average of a long term oi yenr3
shows that in a majority of cases strikes
have succeeded. One of the interesting
facts revealed by the statistics is that large
strikes are much more likely to fail than
those where a moderate number of people
are engaged. The successful striken foot
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 18, 1897,
up 1,188,000, and those that entered into
strikes that failed number Â£,065,000. Sym
pathy strikes have generally been failures,
and this should make clear to labor lead
ers the poor policy of calling upon men
who have no grievance to strike in sym
pathy with those who bave.
The statistics prove, however, that the
percentage of sympathetic strikes is
largely increasing. Another point shown
is that while strikes up to about 1886 were
almost always for the direct purpose of
increasing wages or shortening hours
those of recent years have been largely in
resistance to the employment of non-union
men.
The lesson to be learned from the re
port generally is that although strikes are
in a small majority of cases successful
they entail too great a cost for victory.
Tne vast loss of production is too much to
be thrown away, and the differences be
tween labor and capital sbould always be
settled by arbitration. The cost of a fight
is certain to exceed in an average of cases
wnat would be relinquished by concilia
tion. Both in lockouts and strikes there
is a terrible and needless waste. It seems
absurd to doubt that men could be found
both clear-headed and honorable enough
to settle disputes with a nearer approach
to absolute justice than could be arrived
at by either of the self-interested parties
to the quarrel.
There is, moreover, another way of
looking at the matter. A strike is not
merely a private affair between employers
and employes. The public has vital in
terests which are affected injuriously by
these industrial wars, and sooner or later
this will be so clearly realized that the
people in their soverisn capacity will for
bid strikes aud lockouts. The whole
machinery of progress and prosperity in
our times is so closely interrelated tuat
no disarrangements and interruptions of
any iarge part of it, while selfish interests
fight for mastery, can be permitted by the
coming civilization.
THE D ANISE WEST INDIES.
Among the features of foreign policy
likely to engage, much of the attention of
the incoming administration will be the
proposed purchase of the Danish pos
sessions in the West Indies. Senator
Lodge has already introduced a resolution
of inquiry concerning the advisability of
the purchase and it is assured tbe measure
will have a strong support in tbe Senate.
Tbe possessions of Denmark in the West
Indies consist .of a group of three small
islands, St. Thomas, St. John and Santa
Cruz. They are ol little value to Den
mark and to us they are important only
because our ownership of them would give
us a coaling station for our fleet at a point
where we greatly need one. At the town
of Charlotte Amalle, on St. Thomas
island, there is a good deep water harbor
and as it cxiuld be readily fortitied it
would furnish us a strong base of supplies
in case of any war which should involve
the activity of our navy among the West
Indies.
Denmark.having no use for the islands
and finding them a burden upon her
treasury, is willing to sell them. When
Seward was Secretary of State he began
negotiations for their purchase and offered
$7,500 000 for two of tbe fcroup, St. Thomas
and St. John. The Danish Government at
that time took a vote of the inhabitants as
to their willingness to transfer their alle
giance to the United States and the vote
was strongly in the affirmative. The
Danes and the islanders are therefore
known to be ready to arrange lor the sale,
and it id for our Government to decide
whether or no a coaling station is worth
as much as the price the Danes will be
willing to take.
It is well known our Government has
long sought for a good naval station in
those waters. It will be remembered that
General Grant favored obtaining such a
port in Santo Domingo, while some of our
statesmen have advocated the purchase
and annexation of Cuba. These islands,
of course, would be much more valuable
than tne comparatively barren rocks in
the sea which Denmark has to sell, but
their possession would entail difficulties
we would not have to encounter in the
Danish group.
The situation of affairs in Cuba gives a
degree of importance to the proposed pur
chase which it has not had before, and this
will lead to a serious consideration of the
subject. The resolution of Senator Lodge
serves to bring it before the Senate as a
matter of practical politics and it may yet
prove to be one of the chief issues of de-
Date of tne present session of Congress.

The San Jose Mercury declares that the value
of the robin as an orchard bird has been clearly
demonstrated by experiments upon the large
fruit ranch of George W. Cozz^ns in the Wil>
lows, near San Jo-.e. '-Mr. Cozzeus has for
some time past believed the appearance of
robins in an orchard was more beneficial than
detrimental, on account of the nabits of this
insectivorous bird. lis custom cf locating in
this section only in the winter months, when
the trees are bare and at the time when the
borer and other worms were beginning their

in their favor. When the trees began to blos

"Early this season Mr. Cozzeus gavo strict
orders prohibiting any shooting upon his
place. As a consequence the robins soon dis
covered this harbor of safety from sportsmen
and gathered upon the placa in large num
bers. They were not allowed to be iu6lested
or frightened in any manner and soon became
very domestic in their actions. Four or five
weeks ago Mr. Cozzens began to dig about his
fruit trees ior the borer and canker worm
The robins would gather in the immediate vi
cinity ia large numbers, and as soon as the
dirt was thrown back, from the root of a tree
and the workmen had advanced to one or two
trees away they would settle in the excavated

the vicinity. They would invariably find the
hole in which the borer had entered the bark

sume it.

MODERN THOUGHT
AND ITS TREND
Rev. Dr. Hemphill on the
Bankruptcies of Skep
ticism.
Christian Sentiment Never Â£o
Strong as at the Present
Time.
The Press Gives Too Much Attention
to the Statements of the Enemies
of the Christian religion.
Rev. Dr. Hemphill of Calvary Presby
terian Church preached last evening to a
large audience on "The Trend oi Modern
Tnought" His subject was a good one,
well handled by the eminent divine, and
held the undivided attention of his hear
ers. He spoke, in part, as follows:
Can ye not discern the signs of the times?â
Matthew zvl:3.
God has given us many books and we
should "read, mark, learn and inwardly
digest" them all.
With the book of current thought we
have to do to-night, and if we read it fear
lessly, honestly and reverently we may
humbly claim such a measure of the spirit
of discernment as will enable us to in
terpret God's handwriting inscribed upon
the page of this present time. Among
the facts and situations which indicate
the trend of current thought and its bear
ing upon the present position and the im
mediate future and ultimate destiny of the
Christian faith note the following:
Present-day skepticism has failed ut
terly as a substitute for Christianity.
SkeDtics themselves admit this. One of
them recently expressed his anxiety "Lest
the successive bankruptcies of scepticism
should lead society back once more to
the Christian faith." Such a reaction is
not at all unlikely. Indeed, it is natural
and inevitable, and signs are not wanting
that the reaction has already set in.
The successive systems of scepticism
have failed to fuliiil their promises and
nave paid the paltriest dividends, and
society in the closing years of our century
is getting ready to go back to him who
alone has discovered any real mastery of
the human heart. Skepticism is a self
confessed failure as a substitute for Chris-
tianity.
2. Literary men as a rule ar9 hostile to
the Christian faith. They always have
been. Mr. Leck^ says that during the
space of three centuries they treated
Christianity as simply contemptible.
Hist Cry repeats itself. A hundred years
ago they treated Methodism in England
as simply contemptinie. It is not con
temptible to-day. So we are not surprised
if Christianity receives but scant courtesy
from tha literary men of the nineteenth
century.
Some weeks ago two distinsruished pro
fessors joined in debate on the deep things
of philosophy and religion before the
Presbyterian Ministers' Association. One
of them mood squarely on the platform of
Christian orthodoxy and was dismissed
with one sentence of report in the news
paper I read. The otaer as squ;trely de
nied'the fundamental doctrines of Chris
tianity and was reported yerbatirn. One
thousand years hence, if the world last so
long, another Mr. Lecky will have to ex
press his astonishment at the un:airne-s
oi large sections of the literary men ot the
nineteenth century, who either do not un
derstand the Christian faith or will not
give a fair hearing to it.
The literary men are mistaken if they
think that they are carrying the masses
ot the people with them. Karl Pearson, a
leader of skeptical thought, admits
this in a long and loud lament
in the Fortnightly Rpview, and another
leader of skeptical thought, Thomas Main,
says: "The masses of the people were
never so truly religious as they are now."
The rapid progress of the Saivation Array
is a convincing proof of this. Mr. Benja
min Kidd, in his Social Evolution, says
"that Christianity is not to be gotten ria
ofinttie jaun:y way that literary men
affect when they deal with it. They can
not laugh out of existence the most per
sistent force of civilization." And what
is the result of all this unfair treatment of
Christianity? Mr. Frederic Harrison
sums it all up in these words: "The net
result of the whole negative attack on the
gospel has been to deepen its moral hold
on society."
Christianity has gained some signal
triumphs in this, our century. The fierc
est battle has been waged around the
question of a personal God. Once, and
not very long ago, it was asserted very
dogmatically that the living could come
irom the not living and hence tsie need
of a living God as a Creator was done
away with. A scientist of note in his day
said: "Both observation and experiment
unmistakably testify that living matter
is constantly being formed." Ko scien
tist, believes in spontaneous generation to
day. The scientist goes back irom man
to monkey, from monkey to monad, and
then is confounded with mystery, "an
infinite and eternal energy, from which
all things proceed." As Herbert Spencer
said, "The trend of present-day thought
is toward the doctrine of a personal God."
Our faith in the doctrine of creation haa
not been shaken by nineteenth century
thought, but established rather. The
highest, wisest, latest utterances of scienc;
are in wonderful harmony with the utter
ances of Moses. Science says that the
world came into being so long ago that the
mind cannot span the chasm. Moses
says "In the beginning"â a word elastic
enough to satisfy the demands of the most
exacting scientist. There is no conflict in
the Mosaic and scientific accounts so fur
as we can see. Where did Moses get his
facts?
Our belief in the Mosaic authorship of
the Pentateuch has not been shaken by
nineteenth century thought, but estab
lished. Once, and not very long ago, it
was asserted by the critics that there was
no literary ability in the Mosaic ace to
write such literature as we find in the
pages of the Pentateuch; but archaolo
gists have recently unearthed a vast civil
ization extending back 2000 years before
Abraham was born. "He laughs best who
laughs last." Tne assumption of the ig
norance and literary inability of the Mo
.-aic age to write the Pentateuch cannot
stand the light of recent discoveries.
Criticism is coming round to a more
certified faith in the old boole which once
it assaulted so fiercely. Skeptics not long
Â»go danced with delight around the sup
posed fact that the crit cs had at length
put an extinguisher upon the Bible. Many
such extinguishers have been put upon it;
the light of God's word within has burned
through every one of them. The Bible has
not been singed even by the fiercest fire
of the nineteenth, cantury. The religion
of Jesus Christ is the only living religion
in the world to-day; by which we mean
that It is the leading spirit o modern
progress. The religions of the Orient are
dead. They have hundreds of niiliiona of
followers still, but they are dead to those
functions of inspiration which minister
Btimulus to contemporary thought. "Is
Mohammedanism dead/" As a military
despotism, no; as a living religion, yes.
Its policy is impossible. Its record is one
of intellectual stagnation and moral death
The "unspeakable Turk" is sick ni^h uuto
death. Look by contrast at the ascendin<*
orb of Christian truth as it shines above
in the heavens of religious thought a
love, for the meteors, which tfazzla
a while and then die, uo not belong to
the same heaven at all.
Christian sentimeni is getting to be both
an inspiration and an authoriiy in all
land-. A peace treaty is al! but ratified
between England and the United Slates.
Other lands will follow and war will come
to a lull and speedy end. "Jesus shall
reign where'er the sun does his successive
journeys run." tin, is reijfning now;
reigning in the power of Christian senti
ment where He is not yet reigning in
name, iso sign so clearly attests to one
the'neir supremacy of Christ as this grow
ing power of Christian sentiment.
I notice" one trend more â the growing
power of Christian worK. The signs whicii
the manifoid activities of our age project
upon human life are these: That Christi
anity, the only living religion in the world,
is no temporary federation, but a ministry
of universal love, proving by its nine
teenth century achievements that it is
hastening to make the kingdoms of this
world the kingdom of our Lord and of His
Christ according to the sura word of prom
ise and prophecy.
The execution of certain deeds to cer
tain pieces of real estate is creating quite
a stir in our city. Oath was made that
they were executed in 1894, but the oppos
ing lawyers say that tney are ready to
prove by certain marks that the paper
was not manufactured until two years
later. I have held the writing of nine
teenth century though* up to the light,
and have fouud ten marks upon it to
prove which ought to confirm and estab
lish one faith in orre holy religion.
It shows no sign of waning. "Higher
yet higher that star ascends.' It is the
only living religionâ it is the religion for
all the world. Is it yours? Get into the
chariot oi our all-conquering King as" he
drives toward victory.

DANISH WRITER WANTED.
Professor Brandes of the Copenhagen
University Anxious to Find a
Sailor, Novelist and Poet.
The faculty of the University of Copen

evidence of unusual literary ability.
Professor Georg Brandes, who is at

who is a renowned critic, famous all over
Europe, as well as in the English literary
world, in a letter to M. Salomon, editor of
Pacific Skandinav, a Danish-Norweeian
weekly published in this City, says:
A young man named Theodor Nielsen, of
Gislev. Svendborg, Denmark, an ordinary sea
man, managed by frugality to save sufficient
to enable him to enter the University of Co
penhagen in order to prepare himself for
literary work. His mother before he could
graduate was taken sick and he was forced to
give up his studies, so as to enable him to go
to sea again and earn sufficient to support her.
Abput four years ago I received from him the
manuscript of several poems and novels,
which give evidence of wonderful literary
ability. Three years ago I last heard from
him by letter, and have since sought in vain
to ascertain hit whereabouts. Recently it
tame to my knowledge that Nielsen had lo
cated In California and I wish you would give
this the widest Dubiicity, as I am very anxious
to communicate with him, considering him a
rising star in the .Danish literary world.

Th 3 Yacht Azalene to Take
an Exploring Parly to
Australasia.
Science and Pleasure Will Be
Combined in the
Cruise.
Whalers Seen at Work Off Pigeon
Point From the Deck of the
Orizaba.
The schooner-yacht Azalene is being
fitted out at Sausalito for a long cruise in
the Southern seas. It will be mainly a
pleasure trip, but scientific matterÃ will
not be overlooked. The vessel is owned
by Cantain M. R. Roberts and she will
be in command of Captain George Wesley
Jackson, late of the British navy. Both
the owner and captain have been all over
Australasia and it is the intention of Cap
tain Roberts to visit every island in the
archipelago.
Captain Jackson is well known in Ban
Francisco as a civil engineer, having been
interested in the formation and building
of S;ow Lake and the beautifying of
Strawberry HilL
From here the vessel will make for the
Hawaiian Islands and from there will co
to Samoa, Tongatabu, Fiji, Australia,
New Zealand the New Hebrides, Tahiti,
the Marshall ;Â»roup and last but not le;tst
New Guinea. Every place will be thor
oughly explored and in consequence the
party expects to be gone at least three
years. On his return Captain Roberts
expects to have obtained a vast amount of
valuable information and to have ai least
a boatload of curios.

awaiting a chance to discharee. .When
passing Pigeon Point Captain yon Helms
reports that he *aw two whaleboats after
a humpback. One of the boats struck the
mammal, and the last the people on the
0. izaba saw of the tight was the whale
making a bee line out to sea with the boat
in tow] Should the hunters secure the
animal they wili make enough out of the
oil they can try out of it to return them a
good week's wages.
'lhe steam schooner National City,
bound south, put in here yesterday to land
tne chef engineer. Thech.ef has been a
very sick man for some time, and when off
the Farallones ne notified the captain that
he could not proceed any further. It was
then that the National City was headed
for San Francisco.
The barkeniine Catherine Sudden, over
whose safety some anxiety was felt, has at
lasc arrived at Grays Harbor. She left
San Diego twenty-rive days ago, and
should have reached her destination a
fortnight ago. The captain of tbe vessel
reports a succession of li'tiht End contrary
winds from the time he left San Diego.
Over twenty Chinese from El Paso
created a scene at the ferries yesterday.
They had been deported from Texas and
are on their way to China. They were
like driven cattle and had not the fuintest
idea what was to be done untii one of
their countrymen from Jackson street
explained the situation. Then their fo/ti
tude forsook them and they cried like so
many babies. It did them no good, bow
ever, and the next steamer for China will
tat- them bacK to the land which it has
probably cost them all their hard-earned
money to leave. They have viewed their
El Dorado only to lose it.

In a letter to (Jenerai Forayth General
Miles says: /
As high-power guns are being erected at
LimePOiUt, on the north side of the Golden
Gate^and addi ional batteries of modern guns
and mortars ure soon to be erected there, it ia
important that there be a strong garrison on
that side of the harbor which 1 call the Gib
raltar ot the Pacific Coast.
Angel Island is the right flank of the second
line of defense, and wiil be the most important
hrtiliery station in the harbor. Its armament
will be at least eight high-power guns of a
modern character. Tue Presidio is not a
heavy artillery post, though there are two
butteries there for its protection and tor man
ning the batteries on the south side ot the
Golden Gate. But the Presidio is a grand
reservation for the Pacific Coast, and Us garri
son of heavy artillery, light batteries and bat
talion of CHvalry, and in time a regiment of
in aniry, shou d be available lor any purposes
of regular troops.
The fleld sports at the Presidio will be
come one of the features of that beautiful
spot and will no doubt enlist the interest
ol the citizens. Some time in March there
will bn a grand Held day in which there
will be contestants from every nost in the
department of California. The points
irom which the men will come will be

The new bricK barracks that are being

point of view â in fact, severely so â they
are interiorly arranged with a view to
comfort, and when ready for occupancy
will be appreciated by the men.
CHINESE LAUNDRIES.
The Tolice Raid Those in the Western
Addition and Ninety-Four Arrests
Are Made.
A raid wa3 made by Sergeant Harper
and posse upon Chinese laundries in the
Western Addition yesterday morning, and
from 7 o'clock to 11 ninety-four arrests
were made, each beintr charged with vio
latin the iaundry ordinance.
The streets on which the arrests were

Broaaway and Union.
The ordinance provides that work must
cease in the laundries after 10 o'clock each
night, and from 10 o'clock Saturday night
ti.i 6 o'clock Monday morning.
A clergyman on Pacific avenue com
plained to Captain Wittraan lust week
that tbe services each Sunday in his
church were disturbed by the noise made
by Chinese working in a laundry in rear
of the church. The result was the raid
yes;er!ay morning upon the laundries.
It was probably the first occasion on
whicti bo many Chinese were confined in
the City Prison at one time. Aoout one
third of them were bailed out during the
afternoon and evening.

nities lor ballet and beautiful stage effects.
"A Fair Rebel" Is to bo revived at the
Alcazar this evening. It is a military play
that requires a large number 01 people to
make it effective. The management an
nounces that it has secured all these people,
including a company of military to add real
ism to the scenes..
Still the people do not tire of "Jack and the
Beanstalk" and that Is why the management
of the Tivoli Opera House will offer it again
thin evening. It lias made thousands laugh
and no doubt will do so as lon^ as it is on the
boards.
The melodrama that is to be presented at
the Grand Opera House to-night is entitled
"Against the Stream." It is a uew one to Ban

The Occidental Bail Court was crowded
yesterday by the members and friends of
the club to witness the presentation of the
General J. G. Wall medals. Although
sick, the General was in attendance and
was a keen spectator of the game 3. Presi
dent Condon of the club was billed to
make the presentation speeches, but the
crowd evidently was too much for the
president, and the honor fell upon P. F.
McCormick, who delivered an appropriate
address eulogizing the General, whom be
termed the greatest lover and patron of
amateur sports in America.
Mr. McCormick then pinned the first
medal on Richard Linehan, the great
overhand swiper. The second medal was
given to Al Collins, the third to William
Collins and the fourth to William O'Con
nor. Each of the winners made short but
appropriate speeches, and the meeting ad-
j mrned with three cheers and a tiger for
General J. G. Wall.

His Wife Took Passage on

Vessel Got Away From
Newcastle.
fhe Pilots on the Gracia S Were
Sworn In as Deputy Marshals
Before Sailing.
The Swanbilda was a drawing card at
Meigs wharf yesterday. About 3 p. m.
over a thousand people were walking up
and down the seawall, scanning every sail
that made its way around the Fort, hop
ing against hope that it might be the long-
Jooked-lor ship, with Murderer Butler
aboard.
Early in the day the pilot-boats Lady
Mine and Gracie S went out, and their de
parture caused somewhat of a sensation.
The Lady Mine took out a number of
pigeons, which will be put ashore on the
Faraliones, to bo used in sending the first
news of tbe appearance of the vessel with
the, murderer aboard. After landing her
precious cargo the pilot-boat will at once
return to San Francisco.
The Gracie B has men aboard who are
determined to make a record. Some of
the best pilots in the service are aboard
her, and every one of them has been sworn
in as a United States deputy marshal.
Captain Jordan is in command, and he
carries with him a letter to Captain
Fraser explaining the circumstances of
the rase, and the pilot will not be aboard
the Swanbilda two minutes before Butler
will be in irons, if be is aboard.
Tne Gracie S will be on the outside sta
tion for at least four days, and the pilots
and towboat men are confident that the
Swanhiida will arrive before next Thurs
day. In that event the men on the Gracie
a will be first aboard, and there will be
very litile for the police to do when the
vessel is hove to off Lime Point.
It cropped out to-day for the first time
that Captain Oudney of the big British
ship Hiddekel had an experience win the
murderer. The vessel. was at the time in
Newcastle, N. S. \V., and being loaded
was ready to sail. Butler, or the man
whom the captain asserts was Butler,
came along and asked what accommoda
tion there was on the vessel for pas
sengers. He explained that he bad a sick
wife and that the doctors had advised a
sea voyage. He wanted her to reach Cali
fornia, bui as some business matters re
quired his attention he would be unable
to get away for a month.
Butler wa more than satisfied with the
accommodations on ttie Hiddekel and the
next day brought his wile aboard. The
vessel lay in the stream Jor several days
Letore she pot her clearance papers and in
the meantime the woman gradually sank
and died. Her husband took charge of
lhe body and she wa< buried ashore.
What the nature of her ma. ady was Cap
tain Oudney does not know, but he thinks
it was consumption. The apprentice boys
a- d s:fi-ors om the Hiddekel will not dis
cus-s the matter as they are afraid of rais
ing the â  host of the dead woman.
The Hi ldelcel brought here over 4000
tons Â» f coal which have been discharged.
A week ago ibe joined the diseng ged
t! ft and is now in the stream awaiting a
charter.

Explanation.
The arrow fliea with the wind. The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; thoÂ«e underneath It. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect p<*n s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dottea lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually arcouiDanied by fair weather: "low"
rffers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and aceompHnied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usially first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditloaJ
will produce an opposite result.

Election.
The Need of a Jail for Young Women
Ae;ain Brought to Police
Notice
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 17. )
After all there is just a possibility that
no one was blackball', by tie Cotillion
Club. Explana.icns have been made and
a variety of excuses have teen advanced
that :ire as ingenious a.- numerous. Al
though many names Rre not on the list of
the favored it is possible they were in
vited and that the mail carrier was remiss
in his duty; names rui^lu have been left
off accidentally and without any motive
and others mi^ht not have sought invita
ions. The ledy patronesses ol the co
:ilion are not re^pon^iole for the blue-pen
cil wielding, because they did not even see
the list till it was issued by the mysteri
ous committee, the personnel of which is
D to no one. The names of tne^e
ladies by themselves are a guarantee against
jmy tmall practices. It would, of course,
be preferable to the exclusive Cotillion
Club not to have a single name appear,
but there must be something to indicate
the ciub's patent oi nobility and to ex
clude the idea or suggestion of anything
plebeian, so the following ladies' names
were piaced on tbe invitations: "Mrs. P. K.
Bowies, Mr?. Edson Adams, Mrs. Thomas
Maeee, Mrs. Will Magee, Mrs. R. B.
Pierce, Mrs. W. Henshaw, Mrs. Belle
Mhoon.
None of these ladies, however, Snow
who constituted the committee who re
ceived the applications for invitations
from "P. 0. box 200," although all admit
its existence.
One member of the club *aid something
last nieht that is certainly true, although
the inference derived from his words ia
even more so. "Tnere is always trouble
ever these blue-nenc.l Droceedings," he
sa:a, "but it can't be helped. You see,
things have to be arranged so that
t :ie most congenial people only can meet;
We have to be nuided by circumstances.
I n Oakland there is not a hall larjie enough
10 hold everybody who would like to at
tend the cotillon, and this had to be con
siiiere.i. I feel sorry if anybody was left
out in the cold, but it can't be helped. I
really don't know who did it â it's too
b.-.d."
r?u, although several names were
dropped from last Wednesday's list after
a very careful scrutiny by a secret com
nnttee, the victims should not feel
slignted or aggrieved. It was all due to
forgetfulness, or unintentional oversight,
or to the lack of a capacious hall, so say
tne elite.
What excuse could be made for that
secret committee should an adequate. hall
be buiJt?
The poiitical mind wili be considerably
relieved when the Republican convention
is over. There has been so much said
about the motives of the City Central
Committee in selecting a committee to
appoint the delegates that no one will
feel absolutely safe that the pack does not
contain a joker until after the hand is
shown, it is not surprising that il should
be so, but it would be surprising if it were
not. When the City Central Committee,
led by FrÂ«d A. Campbell and A. L. Mc-
Pherson, appoint George C. Pardee and
his firmest adherents to name a Republi
can municipal convention and the re
sponsibility is accepted, it is so like the
lyin^ down together of the lion and the
lamb that people are forced to wonder.
It is very possible that this is a case in
â which good may come of evil. It has
been known for a long time that Fred
Campbell has not been in harmony with
the element represented by George de
Golia and Thomas Caruthers and it is
stated in certain quarters that he (Camp
bell) turned the party machinery over to
the reformers for the purpose of getting
even with those who had not stood by
him. There is no need for either party to
the transaction to explain any further.
If there has been a job perpetrated the
nominations will show it. Should it ap
pear that there was a slate tixed up the
ticket will be defeated. If everybody has
acted in good faith the Republican ticket
will win.
The necessity of a place where girls and
children can be kept while waiting for
trial was made very clear last week.
Hulda Johnson was charged with a crime,
but there is no dace to put her in the City
Prison, except with females old in vice.
For several days the girl was Kept in the
â woman's apartment, and finally Judge
Weod consented to greatly reduce the
batt, because Miss Johnson could not be
kept in a decent place.
Home months ago Chief of Police Lloyd
laid this matter before the Christian En
cieavorers, but they decided that it was
ii'f within the lines for which they were
> ;anized. Whether it was within their
t jpe or not cuts no figure. It is not tbeir
jjiace to look after young folks who have
been arrested. It is the duty of the city to
provide a proper place with proper attend
ance for young people, and Chief Lloyd
should not give the Cay Council any peace
till he gets what he wants and which is so
urgently needed.
. A prisoner is not permitted to suffer for
â want of attention. Why then should a
child's morals be exposed to vitiation
without protest? Stuakt W. Booth.
FARMERS' INSTITUTE.
It Will Open at I.lvomiure on Monday
Next.
OAKLAND,' Cal., Jan. 17.â The Farm
ers' institute, under the auspices 01 the
â  Etate University, will meet at Livermore
to-morrow.
A very interesting program me to cover
two days' meetings has been arranged.
The institute will be opened with a pa-'
per by E. 8. Adams upon the relation of
the State University to the farmers. Tnis
topic is deemed of special importance.
"Resistant Vines,' 1 a subject of moment
to the grape -growers, wili be discussed by
A. P. Ilayne. "Olive Culture" is the theme
of J. M. Doty's paper. Professor N. E.
J:;ffa will treat of cattle feeding and will
present deductions drawn from experi
ments at the State Agricultural stations.
Valentine Alviso, a pioneer rancher of
the valley, will give some reminiscences of
tarlv farming in California. Professor J.
I W. Connell of the Livermore High School
I 'will speak upon "Agriculture and the
I High Schools.' 1 Professor Jaffa will ban
%iie suggestions for the home table.
On the second day Professor Jaffa will
open the institute witb a talk upon "Cali
fornia Creamery Butter." E. C. liahn
will illustrate, with a large number of
epecimen!', the results of experimental to
bacco culture. Horse-breeding was as
signed to H. P. Mohr. J. A. Fiicher wili
discuss foreign markets, and Mrs. W. W.
Cunningham will speak on "Home Mar
kets." State Highway Commissioner
Marsden Manson will close with a talk
on the value of good roads. There will
be general discussions of the various sub
jects. A question box for inquirers will
be placed within reach of all.
Popullat Convention.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 17.â The munici
pal Populist convention will meet to
morrow night at Kohler & Chase's Hall.
A caucus of delegates was held to-day and
there is ample evidence that there wiil be
lots of harmonizing required to make
nominations harmonious.
BISHOP NEWMAN'S ADDRESS.
He Speaks J'.eforo a Large Audience in
the University Town.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 17.â Bishop J.
P. Newman preached a stirring sermon at
Trinity Methodist Church this morning to
a large audience, among which there was
an appreciable number from the other
churches of Berkeley, as well as from the
university faculty. The topic of his dis-
course was "The Philosophy and Blessed
ness of Christian Experience," and was
based upon the words found in John
iii:ll: "We speak that we do know and
testify that we have seen."
In the treatment of his subject he drew
inferences from the material world to
guide him in reaching conclusions as to
things spiritual. His address was elabor
ated with copious reference to science,
philosophy and history, he said that as
our senses and intellects are the babes in
our mode of thought concerning things
temporal so should they be our guile in
matters spiritual. It was his belief that
man should be guided by his own con
science, and that he should have a Chris
tian experience of his own.
Bis address was, in pan, as follows:
Man has agreed that the testimony of the
senses is reliable. Every science depends
upon the reliability of tin; senses for Us foun
dation, and there is not one which is not
based upon M.eh testimony. God has or
dained th.it they he reliable, and so they are.
It is true that" the imagination may become
vicious and tiiat the memory be at Jault, but
these are only extreme f.-ses. Society trusts
that the operations of the senses are in the
main reliable. Man is just as competent to
observe a stone roll up bili a* he is to see it
roll down hill. Such is the integrity of your
senses.
Some people stand aghast at the word super
natural. It merely means that there is some
thing above nature ; that there are gradations
by whicn the Supreme Being is approached.
As the angeis are super to man, so is the Lord
God super to the angels. The day wiil come
when tlie clÂ»rgy will have the courage to say
that miracles are the mere expression of His

WILL GIVE THE FARCE.
Christian Endeavorers Change
Their Date and Go
Ahead.
Mr. Falkinham Denies That Enter
tainments Are Harmlul and
Says There's a Mistake.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 17.â The farce
to be given by the Christian Endeavor So
ciety oi the First Presbyterian Church on
Feoruary 12 has been set for Tuesday
evening, February 9, the pastor to the con
trary notwithstanding. At least that was
the word given out to-day by the 6ocial
committee, which has the matter in
charge. The commit tee consists of Joseph
Joseph Falkingham, Chairman of
the Social Committee of the
First Presbyterian Christian En
deavor*
Falkinham (chairman), Miss Alice Hand,
Miss Belle Morton, F. A. Burrell, Miss E.
A. Hobler and Miss Elsie Hutton.
Mr. Falkinham is considerably worked
up over the affair, and declares that the
published sta.eruents are untrue. He be
lieves that the reporters either misunder
stood Mr. Brush or the latter misunder
stood the reporters. Be that as it may, he
is determined to give a fair interpretation
of the case.
"I am sure Mr. Brush knew of onr in
tention of giving the entertainment," said
the chairman, "anH he gave his approval
by saying, 'I hope you will be puccesslul.'
He has not asked us to give up, but to-day
said that he would rather not have it on
the 12th, as that came too near to com
munion Sunday. I asked if it might be
set for the 9th and he said, 'Yes.'
"Mrs. Harry F. Sheldon has charge of
the farce, and the others in it, so far as I
can remember, are G. Goggin, H. F. Shel
don, Belle McCurrie and Bert Burrell.
They are among the best people in our
society and I am sure they would not
give it up. We never have had an enter
tainment of this kind since the Kind's
Daughters gave up their organization,
and we Lave never had ?o many outsiders
at the church, either. Mr. Brush will ad
mit that these Catherines tend to bring
the unconverted to our churches."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY JANUARY 18, 1897.
NO APPEARANCE
OF THE SLATE
Republican Delegates Give
No Indication of Being
Pledged.
No One Is Certain of Receiving
Any Particular Nomi
nation.
The Old Municipal League's Position
Is One of Patient
Waiting.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 17. j
The Republican City Convention will
assemble at Elite Hall to-morrow night,
and no convention for six years has been
so surrounded with interest.
The last two biennial municipal cam
paigns have been carried on to a certain
extent along party lines, but the powerful
Municipal League has really named tbe
successful ticket. Owing to the peculiar
arrangement by which the present dele
gates are named the strength of the league
is now embodied in the regular Repub
lican party, and the opposing element
does not yet sea where it is to land.
ThÂ« position of Mayor Davie is of much
interest at this time. He has declared his
intention of being a candidate to succeed
himself, but he cannot say on what ticket
he will be found.
Davie's standing is unusual. He was
nominated by Populists two years ago,
but he cannot be called a Populist at this
time, although he is probably no less
strong politically than formerly, but his
strength is from, different quarters. In
view of the developments of the water
front question, for the recovery of which
Davie laid the foundation four years ago,
he should be an exceptionally strong can
didate at this time.
The doubt existing over the nomination
that will be tendered Auditor Snow will
not be cleared up until the convention
meets. Should he not be nominated for
Mayor he will almost certainly be placed
in line to succeed himself.
There are so many candidates for every
place that there will certainly be several
independent candidates. They will pro
tect themselves from being designated
bolters by declining to admit that they
approve of the appointment of delegates,
instead of electing them.
It is very evident that the great mass of
voters are taking little interest in the party
designations of tickets, and it is plain that
when all the nominations are made every
body will make his own choice.
In the absence of any primary law little
is being said about the matter. It is gen
erally recognized that without a law a
primary is simply a farce, and even those
who fought so hard for it now express an
unwillingness to bear the expense.
THE VACCINATION TANGLE.
Dr. Rowell Is Fuming Over the Crit
icism* Passed Upon Him.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 17.â The affairs
of the Berkeley Board of Education are in
a tangle. The vaccination question has
well nigh reached a crisis, and Health
Officer Rowell ia after Director Norton's
scalp for an imputation reflecting upon
the former's character and integrity as a
town officer. All these things will come
up for settlement at the board meeting to
morrow night.
Dr. Rowell's erievances against-Director
Norton will probably be the first thing to
be disposed of.
What has caused this friction between
the two officials is a statement reported tc
have been made by Mr. Norton at the last
meeting of the board, to tbe effect that
Dr. Rowell has a sliding scale of prices,
ranging all the way from 15 cent 3to $2 50,
which he uses in making his charges lor
inoculating with the virus. Dr. Rowell
flatly denies this, and furthermore states
that'what Director Norton said is a "ma
licious falsehood from beginning to end.
If I was talking to his face," said Dr.
Rowell to-day. lt I would put it consider
ably stronger, but to say tbat he has told
a falsehood is heavy enough for publica
tion.
"He has said of me that I was holding
my job as Health Officer for personal
gain, and that 1 consider a slander on my
character and reputation. I will show
Norton that I know he has assailed me
with malice aforetbonght, and will be pre
pared to absolve myself before the board
from tbe pollution into which Norton has
tried to cast me."
Dr. Rowell will recommend to the board
that they now rigidly enforce the State
law compelling vaccination in the pubiic
schools, which will mean of course that
all pupils who are not immediately inocu
lated shall be prevented from attending
recitations.
Only about three-quarters of those in
the public schools have complied with the
law. Of the remaining one-quarter about
ball have not been well enough to be vac
cinated, and the others appear to be hold
ing off, so Dr. Rowell :ays, on account of
the obstinacy of their parents.
A storm of opposition to the enforce
ment of the law is expected from the par
ents of the uiivaccinatud children at the
meeting, and in order to rise to the occa
sion Dr. Rowell will taKe along with him
Town Attorney Hayne, TVho will repre
sent the legal side of the question.

DIVINE PROPHETS.
Sermon by Bey. WJlliaui Under, De
livered at the third Congre
gational Church.
The following ia a synoDSis of a ser
mon delivered last night by Rev. W.
Raderof the Third Congregational Church:
A prophet is not a fortune-teller. The origi
nal Hebrew root means "boiling or bubbling
over." The sites chosen by the Grecian oracles
were marked by rushing springs, which;bub-.
bled up out of the rocky recesses of the native
hills. So the Psalmist says: "My heart is
bursting, bubbling over with good matter."
In the Indo-Germanic languages the word In
dicates fermenting yeast or the steaming gey
ser. The practical meaning of the prophet is
an interpreter; not a foreteller only, but
a spokesman or expounder of truth. H3 is al
ways distinguished by splendid earnestness,
wedded to a commanding piety grounded in
convictions of right *nd wrong. There is a
difference between the priest and prophet.
The one interprets man to God, the other in
terprets God to maH. The prophet is greater
than the priest.
Prophecy Is the noblest passion of history,
belonging alike to Heathenism and Christian
ity. It is the most important part of the Old
Testament. It rings with the noblest elo
quence. Thunder runs through this prophetic
period. Thrones fall, but in sil the clash and
conflict the prophet stands unmoved with his
vision of a golden age.
The heathen seer placed the golden age be
hind. The Christian prophet locates it in the
future. The three steps oi prophecy known as
the dream, the vision and the spiritual in
sight, are common to the religious world.
Tue first Is the most wonderful, the second is
the most common and the third is the most
rational. There is an evolution of prophetic
gift these artists have painted progressively.
At first the dream outlines of a golden age,
and then a person becomes the incarnation oi
these divine dreams, and we have Messianic
prophecy. Tho burden of it all was that the
best was yet to be. A great good was ex
pected.
All the prophecies were not fulfilled. We
still await the model state of Isaiah,
and Jeremiah never saw the fullfiilment of
his predictions of a regenerated Israel. The
model Kiug has not yetcome, but those unful
filled prophecies do not in the least Invalidate
the character of these men, or the messages
they deliver.
The predictive clamant in prophecy Is by no
mcaus the most Important. The prophet is
still the man for the bour. He stands lor in
tellectual honesty and for the courage of his
convictions. What this Nation uteds is the
honest man. The time server is a popular
menace. He who selli his thought is a traitor
to truth. The man who "escapes from tbe av
erage" is the true evangelist. We need men
who speak for the living God as distinctly as
tho waves echo his almighty power. Many
men spenk for humanity. Champions of pop
ular liberty abound.
1 hey lean on the bars of gilded saloons and
they Btand on the comers ot the street talking
for humanity. Men there are who shape their
thought according to the popular drift.
Spokesmen there are who interpret the plati
tudes of the masses. Diplomats are numer
ous who never venture far from tne shore,
and who are always anchored in the "conven
tional ignorance" of the people. Men abound
who have courage because they are iti the ma
jority. But it is not the priest for whom the
nations cry, but the man who comes with in
tellectual honesty, interpreting the mind of
God for the sake of the people. No man is
truly great who does not speak for God. It is
then, and then only that a man stands alone,
and that is statesmanship; that is genius.
We need prophets who will stand before the
organized vices of our times and spare not the
seifixh wishes of the people in their denuncia
tion of public wrongs. It is the prophet, not
the politician, who will solve the temperance
question and drive out many of the evils of our
land. It is the prophot, not the priest, who
will recover the greater truths of the revela
tion and set them forth as the very mind of
God.
The spirit of Christ Is the spirit of prophecy.
Christianity is the incarnation of hopeful
courage. The world has uot been left without
its prophets. St. Augustine was n prophet.
John Wikcliffe, who saved the Bible and hon
ored reason; Martin Luther, who carried his
convictions and hurled them in thunderbolts
at the head of Charles V; Savonarola and Maz
zini, John. Wesley, Fred Dennison Maurice
and Horace Bushnell were prophets. And
Rev. Dr. Parkhurst, standing before the Tam
many ring of New York City, reproduces in the
kinetoscope of our own times the splendid
figures of Jeremiah and Savonarola of oid.
Hut ihi.y h*ve always been stoned. Whether
they have appeared in science, letters, politics
or religion, they hnvo been stoned. Always
have they spoken within sight of the cross.

NEGLECTING THEIR
OPPORTUNITIES
The Terms of the Railroad
Commissioners Rapidly
Slipping Past.
Can Bring Before It Southern
Pacific Books, Papers, O'fi
rials and Secrets.
A. J. Ctunie Thinks the Present Path
of Procedure Is Wrongâ La
Rue's Opinion.
i
The strone probability is that, though
the Southern Pacific officials are willing
to compromise with and dismiss their
present suit if the commission will con
sent to a reduction of 4 per cent instead of
8 per cent on grain rates, as related in
yesterday's Call, a suit to restrain such a
compromise will be riled by an outside
party. Asa matter of fact, Attorney A.
J. Clunie, who has represented the Rail
road Commission in considerable litiga
tion, said he was quite positive that such
a suit would intervene.
Mr. Clunie was greatly surprised, as
were a great many other people yesterday,
that the idÂ«a oi compromise had ever been
born under the tiara that crowns the
Huntington system. The suit now pend
ing is one of the most important ever
brought in California, or railroad circles
any wner c, and it is little wonder that the
proposed compromise attracted so much
attention. f
"Who thinks," said Mr. Clunie, "that
the railrroad company would compromise
on a 4 per cent gain rate unless it baa
some un derstanding with the commission
in regard to reductions on other freight?
I venture to say that a reduction of grain
rates would carry with it other freight
concessions, or it would not be made.
Would the commission thus abandon its
opinion in regard to freight in general for
a little concession of one article of trans
portation? I guess not.
"I do not speak for the commission, but
I hardly think that such a proposition
would be entertained by Commissioner
Btanton or Commissioner La Rue. This
proposed compromise is thrown out by
the railroad company probably as a feeler.
My own opinion about this whole litiga
tion is that it is being done in the wrens:
and the least effective way â in a way that
will be of the least benefit to the people,
if any benefit at all comes out of it.
"The commission should take this mat
ter of investigating freight rates, operating
expense?, iixed charges and profits into its
own Hands, as it has power under the
constitution to do. It has the broadest
possible power, and if that plan were
adopted the commission would zet the
facts it wants, or there would be more
sensational results than might develop
from the company's books. Commis
sioner fstanton takes this view of the situ
ation. He introduced a resolution at a
meeting some time ago to the effect that
the commission take the matter in its own
hands, subpena witnesses, examine the
company's books, etc. Nobody supported
the resolution. Cummisaioner La Rue
thought that it might interfere with the
pending litigation and with the plans of
their attorneys. Of course the attorneys,
in the event of success, want to get all the
glory they can out of it.
"ft is clear to my mind," continued At
torney Clunie, "that the policy of the rail
road company is one of delay. Ido not
think they want a decision from the
United States Supreme Court, for if it
went against them it would be positively
disastrous to them.
"The term of the present Railroad Com
missioners expires in two years. It is ex
ceedingly doubtful that the State will evÂ«r
have another commission such as this.
The railroad did not want Dr. Stanton,
but they looked upon him as harmless,
instead of which he has been the most ac
tive in the interests of the people. It is
fhr better for the railroad company to have
a Railroad Commission it can control than
to have all the court decisions it wants.
Commissioner La Rue was elected in his
district by a small majority.
"Commissioner Stanton's district is in
the hands of the political bosses. The
next time the railroad will spare
no contingent inducements to elect
a railroad commission such as it wants.
It won't get even so far as the nomination
of Stanton and La Rue. This is the best
Railroad Commission the people ever had.
âº The Railroad Commission dates from the
adoption of the present constitution in
1879, and, ud to the present one, no com
mission nas ever done anything. There
will be delay and delay in the present
litigation till the terms of the present
Commissioners expire. It will accomplish
nothing, proceeding alone the present
lines of action, but if the commission
t:tked the matter in its own hands it can
soon get at the bottom of the question of
expenses and reasonable or exorbitant
profits.
"Imagine the Railroad Commission sit
ting as a court with the broadest possible
powers, the constitutionality of which
were recently sustained by Judge Ale-
Kenna's decision, subpenaing Vice-
President Charles F. Crocker and asking
him how much salary he gets â whether it
is $50.(^0 or $500. If Mr. Crocker declines
to give the information, the commission
has power to fine the first vice-president
heavily or send him to jail for contempt.
If Mr. Crocker should courteously decline
to go to jail, and he would doubtless de
cline in that manner if He declined at all,
the commission has authority to summon
the court machinery and the State militia
to enforce its sentence on Mr. Crocker.
"Suppose Collis P. Huntington were
caught in the State and asked concerning
the nature of contingent inducements
held out to Congressmen back at Wash
ington, D. C, recently, verily Mr. Hunt
ington would have to satisly the commis
sion on the point or be handed over to the
custody of the Sheriff or draw on his per
sonal sack to pay a fine.
"In truth the Railroad Commission has
power to do all these things, as witness
the following excerpt from article XII,
section 22, of the State constitution, which
gave it birth and upholds its dignity:
Said commissioners shall have the power,
and it shall be their duly, to establish rates 01
charges for the transportation of passengers
and lreUht by railroador other transportation
companies, aud publish the same from time to
time, with such changes as they may make;
to examine the books, records and papers 01
all railroad or other transportation companies;
and for this purpose they shall have the power
to issue subpenas and all other necessary
process; to hear and determine complaints
against, railroads and other transportation
companies; to send for persons and papers ; to
administer oaths, take testimony Â»nd punish
for contempt of their orders and processes, in
the same manner and to the same extent as
courts of record and enforce their decisions
and correct abuses through the medium of tne
courts.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Jan. 17.-H. M.
La Rue, chairman of the Railroad Com
mission, wben seeu at his homo this even
ing relative to the proposition of the
Southern Pacific to compromise the suit
brought by that corporation against the
commission stated that this rather sensa
tional development of the matter was not
a very great surprise to him.
"For some reason or other," he said, "I
have had an impression that there would
be some sucn outcome of the suit. I had
either heard something intimating this or
had gained the idea from the fact that I
knew the Southern Pacific would never let
things come to that point where their
booKs would have to be thrown open to a
thorough investigation.
"Of course, if the -company decides to
dismiss the suit, we could do nothing to
prevent it. We would then feel obliged,
naturally, to make such reductions as we
deemed proper. That is wherever we
found rates on any branch or on any com
modity too high, we would reduce them.
I believe, however, that ttiis would be done
only after a proper investigation of the
facts and circumstances connected with
each case.
"I hardly think a compromise of the
matter is likely, but I would not care to
express myself definitely until after I had
consulted with the Attorney-General.
"The talk about the suit being a heavy
tax upon the people is simply nonsense.
The commission is in earnest in this mat
ter and proposes to push the case to a
trial on its merits. For this reason lam
anxious that the bill appropriating $30,000
for tbe compensation. of experts and otner
expenses in connection with the funding
case should pass the Legislature.
"So far as the railroad company is con
cerned, the amount involved is insignifi
cant, and the motive for the compromise
is certainly not the desire to protect the
revenue that would be lost by an 8 per
cent reduction on grain rates."
ABOUND THE DIAMOND.
The Santa Claras Defeat the San Fran
cisco Violets at Central
Park.
Thevisitors from Santa Clara shut out
the Violets in a hotly contested game at
Central Park by a score of 8 to 3.
The Santa Claras duplicated the Violets'
feat of last Sunday by scoring four runs
in thr> first inning.
F. I'oley was the first batter up*and sent
a hot grounder to right for a safe hit;
Robinson gained first by bunting the bail
in front of the plate and Foley went to
second. Graham hit to O'Day and on his
error reached first and filling the bases.
Foley scored a moment later on a wild
pitch, as diÂ«l Robinson on Pereeria's sacri
fice hit. Farry kept up the good worK by
sending the ball over first for a hit.
Sweert threw too late to prevent Graham
from scoring. During tne excitement
Farry stole second with Fitzpatrick at his
heels. Drahiceyich hit safe over short,
but was thrown out trying to steal second.
G. Foley was given a base on balls and
Farry scored on Fitzpatrick's wild throw.
Steffani ended the run-getting by strik
ing out.
The visitors added one more run in the
next inning and neither learn was able to
score until the eighth inning. The Vio
lets played in hardest kind of luck. Three
times they had three men on bases, but
Santa Clara's clever pitcher would settle
down to business and fool the batter by
his large assortment of curves.
In the eighth inning the Violets' substi
tute mascot removed the hoodoo and
O'Day hit to the grandstand for two bases.
Sweigert followed up with a pretty hit
over third and stole second. J. Kelly hit
to the pitcher and was thrown out. Egan,
after having three chances to win the
game when men were on bafses, hie the
ball to short and gained first on Foley's
error. It was his only one, but had he
not let it pass him the Violets would have
been whitewashed.
As it was O'Day scored. Sweigert fol
lowed him home on a poor throw to Foley.
McCarthy hit over short for a safe hit and
Egan went to third. T. Kelly then hit a
slow ball to short and Egan beat the ball
home. Steffani steadied himself and
struck Fitzputrick and T. Kelly out, end
ing the innine.
To show there" was no ill feeling the
Santa Clara boys scored three more runs
in the ninth. "Graham reached hrst on a
hit over short and came home on Pereira's
home run swat over the right field fence.
Harry then smashed the ball over third
for a hit and Ecan ran from center and
got the bail, and thinking he could put
the batter out, made a long throw to first,
and as he misjudged the distance the ball
went over the first baseman's head into
the crowd.
Before Sweert could recover the bal
Farry was on third and scored on Sweert's
wild throw between third and home.
Drahicevich was struck out and Foley hit
safely to rightrield. Steffani struck out
and t'arreira hit to third and out. The
Violets were unable to do anything in the
next inning. .
The feature of the game was the battery
work of Sieffani and Graham. The former
held the Violets down to eight hits and
struck ten man out.
The Violets' defeat may be attributed to
Steffani's clever pitching and the splendid
support given him.

LECTOR RUTHVEN

Followed From Metropoli
tan Hall by an Angry
Crowd.
A Pamphlet Circuiat-rd in the
Meeting Brands Him as an
Ex-Convict
The Speaker Snys Ho Was Once a
Priest, but He Is Now Denounc
ing Catholicism.
Victor M. rlnthven, who says tie was at
one time ordained as a Roman Catholic
priest, but who is now lecturing for and
under the indorsement of the American
Protective Association, spoke at Metro
politan Temple yesterday afternoon on
"Romanism and Civil Liberty."
He announced that he would lecture at
the same place on Tuesday night "for
men only" on the alleged moral delin
quencies of priests.
The lecture of yesterday was in itself
not nearly ?o bitter as many that have
been delivered from the same platform,
but the speaker was followed by a number
of angry people after ne had finished and
compelled to hasten to a .Powell-street car
lor his safety.
Speaking of the incident Sergeant Con
boy said: "I suppose the speaker wns
pursued in a body by a hundred people,
but a Powell-street car came along just in
time and he dodged into it. I had twelve
men on hand to prevent anything like a
riot."
Before the speaking began apam.hlet
entitled "Ruthven's Record" was freely
circulated at the door by the American
Women's Liberal League. It states that
the speaker is a fraud, and that he served
a term in the penitentiary at Eiie, Pa., for
obtaining money under false pretenses.
When seen regarding the matter after the
lecture the speaker said it was true that
he had spent a year in the penitentiary,
but he said he was persecuted by Roman
Catholics.
Speaking of the pamphlet, at the be
ginning of his address, the lecturer said:
"The document contains just enough
truth to be boldly misleading. lam not
here after a job, a wife or a church, and
my personal character does not enter into
this question at all."
The speaker also stated that the circu
lation of the pamphlet would result in his
lecturing next Sunday.
His address of yesterday consisted in a
review of some of the well-known Protest
ant accusations against the Catholic
church. He quoted largely from "The
Dutch Republic," by Motley, and referred
to the fact that the Catholic church has
been arbitrary in the past and that it is
to-day seeding for power and trying to
subvert the free institutions of this
country.

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
Steady Growing Revival
in the Business Has
Not Yet Developed.
The Slight Improvement After
Election Proved to Have
Been Only a Flurry.
Trade and Traff.c Are Not Yet by
Any ; Means Ai to Be De
sired.
Whatever may be promised for the future by
sanguine pro; hets of good times to come in the
real-estate bus.ness as well as In all other
branches of trade they cannot claim with
widespread show of proof that we enter the
new year in full realization of the rosy pre
dictions they made prior to the Presidential
election in theevontof Republican victory.
Trade and traffic are not yet by any means all
to be desired, but on the contrary the prompt
improvement which manifested itself in ail
branches of industry nnd every field of finance
immediately after election has proven In a
large measure more of a flurry than a steedy
poing revival. It was too sudden to last long,
and the reaction has produced considerable
disappointment, not to say discouragement.
The daily press in all parts of the country
caught the spirit of popular rejoicing over the
triumph of sound money and national honpr
proclaiming the gala day of renewed prosper,
ity And returning thrift, but is now compelled
to acknowledge a hesitation in trade revival,
a slack in the impetus which was reported in
all branches of manufacturing industry and
commercial enterprise just after the election.
This setback, though possibly dishearten
ing, is not st-rious. It is only the proverbial
"swing of the pendulum." We started too
fast: wa have simply stopped to get onr second
wind.
Prior to November 4, confronted as we were
by all the uncertainties of the currency prob
lem, confidence throughout the wido realm of
business was suspended, credit was practi
cally inoperative and trade in all branches
was paralyzed. Sudden relief from this great
strain naturally made a st asmodic burst of im
provement everywhere, but that was not a
veritable cure for the unhealthy condition
into which we had gradually come.
It must be remembered that our late com
mercial and financial straits were not the
troubles of a day or hour, but the accumulated
and intensified evils of several years, running
almost without check or challenge since the
international panic of 1893. Xo man is fit to
run a race the dny after he passes the crisis of
a long and serious illness; and no more can
trade ai.d traffic, after protracted prostration,
fee instantane u~ly spurred back into robust
strength and vigorous activity. Convalescence
is a slow process.

Mrs. Margaret E. Crocker Gives
Three Handsome Oil-Paintings to
the P .rk Museum.
The chief attraction at the parfc yester
day was Mrs. Crocker's handsome gift of
three lar^e pictures, wbicn have recently
been hong in the Museum. Mrs. Mar
garet E. Crocker of Sacramento, widow of
the late E. B. Crocker, has presented 10
the museum time large oil paintings,
representing the rape of the Sabine
women. The first is called the "Inva
sion," the second the "Abduction," and
the third the "Captivity." They are the
work of the San Francisco artist Charles
C. Nahl, and were painted in 1871.
These pictures represent the seizure by
the followers of Romulus?, the first King
of Rome, of the wives and daughters of
the Sabines and the bearing 01 them off tr>
be forcibly made wives of by the warriors.
The first of the trio shows in the fore
ground a beautiful, smiling ana happy
woman, between two powerful men, who
show a contrast between ttie barbarian
warrior ana the better-clad and fiuer
armed soldier of Romulus.
In the next piciure the fair woman pic
tured has a face distorted with fear and
grief as she is being borne alolt upon the
shoulder of a soidier who holds an un
bheathea sword ready to make deter
mined fight to retain his captured treas
ure. 'Ihe thira picture shows a woman,
with eyes red with weeping, turning away
in scorn from tiie wooing of the armed
soidier, who is alone in the chamber with
her.
The museum has received several other
donations recently. Three from G. W.
Ethel of San Francisco, viz., a piece of the
iron-wood flagstaff which formerly stood
in the front ot the Governor's residence at
Tahiti. It was carved by natives with
stone implements. A piece of door from
ruins of a heathen castie on the Society
Islands, and a piece of hipbone of a mas
todon. George Gan>ber has given a collec
tion of Confederate currency, Dr. M. E.
Smith two historic newspapers, and the
Sacramento Chamber ot Commerce six
large fruit jars.
The tine weather drew a large crowd out
to the Park and a'so to tne Cliff House.
At the Sutro Baths the tug-of-war be
tween Sweden and the United Slates was
quickly decidpd. The hard tugging com
menced at once when the pistol tired.
Both sides seemed bent on forcing the
struggle to a suilden conclusion. In t:;ree
and a half minutes the Swedes had pulled
the Americans acros3 the line.
The fifty-yard boys' race at the Sutro
Baths was "Won by August Burtra:id, witn
Emile Eemond second. Tue 100-yard
race, o] en to a 1, was won by Jake Foster,
with J. Rinprose second. The diving by
Mowry, Scuuliie and Empey from a
height of sixty feet was gracefully exe
cuted.
At the Chutes, a popu'ar feature was
the trained ponies of Bristol's hor>e show.
There was a little donkey among the edu
cated equines who had a great fondness
lor dram drinking irom a bottle. The
trainer protested against the long draught
the donkey was taking and shook the but
tle loose and put it to his own lips. Then
the donkey thought the trainer was
taking too iong a Dull and begun to pro
tect by vigorously shaking the trainer's
arm with his teeth. The ponies were
b?autitul and highl? trained. The one
legged bicycle rider performed his
daring dart down the chute and was
thrown far out into the water. Two boys
who participated in the potato race had
lots of fun themselves and made lots of it
for the spectators.

SHAKEN UP BY
SEISMIC FORCES
San Francisco Trembled
for a Brief Spacs
Yesterday.
Dramatic Ccens in a Baptist
Congregation in Oak
land
The Shocks Were S milar to Those
Caused by an Explo-
A sharp earthquake shock wa? left in all
parts of this City a fraction of a minute
after l:o9o'ciqck yesterday afternoon.
There were two well-defined counter
vibrations of considerable force, accord
ing to the descriptions by Weather Ob
server McAdie, who carefully noted the
time, and subsequently compared notes
with one of his co-worker? in the weather
forecast olrice in the Mills building.
"It was one of the shortest shocks I ever
felt," said Mr. McAdie, some hours after
the incident, "and I do not know yet that
it was not an explosion of some sort rather
than an earthquake, lor I was at luncheon
at the time and could not see that the sur
face of the cream or ot any ot the other
liquids on the table had been disturbed,
as th'.-y should have from an earthquake."
The whole Mills building shook dis
tinctly from top to bottom with, the
momentary shock, and all those who were
in the building at the time experienced
the peculiar tremor.
Protestor Georsre Davidson says he felt
two siight shocks about four seconds
apart. He tliinks the motion was whoily
vertical.
Although he experienced no lateral os
cillation, there may have been one north
and south, which he coold not feel be
cause his house extends such a length in
that direction that such a movement
would not have been perceptible.
The professor's sei.-mograpli was out of
order, so he got no record of the force of
the shock, but he is confident it was not
so much as a tenth of an inch.
In Oakland the nature of the shocks and
the peculiar noise with which they were
accompanied were exactly similar to those
that accompany an explosion.
The people in Oakland are so accus
tomed to sucn shocks that everybody at
once concluded that the periodical explo
sion at tne powder-works had taken place,
and waited to hear how many lives had
been sacriticed. Soon the report was re
ceived that it was all the result of an
earthquake, and the excitement was al
layed.
The effect of the severe shock was most
apparent in the churches. At the Tenth
Avenue Baptist Church the shuck came as
a dramatic cimax to the pastor's address.
Rev. C. M. Hill had just reached the point
where he had placed' the grave question of
the acceptance or rejection of salvation
vividly before his audiance.
"Can you afford to be indifferent?" said
the pastor. The next moment the sanctu
ary was violently shaken.
Many of tne congregation stood up in
terror, and several of the younger mem
bers ran' out of the build ine. Sever.il
women were so shocked that they burst
into tears and others turned deathly pale.
The greatest excitement prevailed, and
from all parts of the house hysterical
screams were heard.
Deacon Joseph Piaw allayed tbe feelings
of some by ri.-ing to his. feet and saying:
"You need not be afraid. If you art- safe
you should rejoice. It is simply the voice
of the Lord "peaking to his ptople."
One of the members of the church
stated th&t the feeling was like that which
would be experienced it some giant had
got below the church and shaken it up.
The vibrations of the seismic needle at
the Chabot Observatory showed tt:at there
was a heavy disturbance ana that the
vibrations were mainly from east to west.
EMBLEM OF SOCIALISM
G. B. Benham Explains the True
Meaning ot the Red
Banner.
Says That It Stands for A 1 That Is
Good and Against All That
Is Bad.
Tbe socialist movement in this City and
vicinity is becoming more enlivened every
week. The meetings are more largely at
tended than ever before, and as may be
expected many new faces are observed at
the weekly gatherings and propaganda
meetings. With some it is a desire for
knowledge upon economic matters; with
others it is curiosity to see what the .so
cialists do and he..r \vhat they say. It is
rarely the case that the tirst visit fails to
lead to tbe second and the third and so on
until a regular attendance results.
Tbis Das been the experience of the
American branch of the San Francisco
section. At hrst the members of the paity
met in small halls and held meetings on
the street corners. Increasing member
ship made larger halia necessary, aud
when the plan of holding Sunday-night
lectures was decided upon the branch
moved into one of the large halls in Pyth
ian Castle.
For several weeks past even this apart
ment, which holds over 300, ha*- not been
large enough to accommodate all who de
sired to be present, and many have been
turned away, lor there was not even
standing room.
Last week the branch decided to secure
a still larger hall, which was done, and
during the remainder of the year, begin
ning in February, tne lectures- will be
held in Washington Hall on Eddy street.
The socialists are about to make another
movement in the line of progress, and be
fore long they will puplish a socialist
newspaper. W. W. Wiikins will be the
editor. This gentleman is well known all
over the United State*, may be not as
a socialist, but certainly as a Populist.
He it was who was the author of the
Omaha platform of that party.
Later he got out oi the Populist traces
and became known as the leader of the
middle-of-the-road element. His next
mov ment was as the organizer of labor
exchanges, and in this line of work he is
known all over this coast. While always
a socialist in principle*, it was not until
recently that he came out as a full and
pronounced socialist, and the party be
lieves that he will represent it in the new
paper. It will start-as a monthly, but as
soon as possible it will become a weekly
paper.
A new section, to be known as Section
Berkeley, was formed yesterday noon
almost in the very shadow of the State
University across the bay. Messrs. Hecht,
Benham and Wiikins went to Berkeley
yesterday in response to a call from a
number of liberal-minded people of that
place, and in a surprisingly short space of
time the new section was formed and the
following officers selected: Oreanizer, A.
C. Hawkins; recording secretary, Mrs. H.
Grebs; financial secretary, E. Grebs;
treasurer, John H. Eustice.
In the formation oi the new section
there is a little feature that is not gener
ally known even in soc alist circles. It
is well known that a large number of stu
deir.s at the Leland Stanford Jr. Univer
sity and some of the professors too are so
cialists or have socialistic tendencies. The
Berkeley students, at least many ot them,
have been making inquiries into the un
derlying principles of the issue and have
been much impressed. It is not always
policy to openly declare the nature of
one's convictions, even to friends. How
ever, the new section was created as much
for the benefit of the Berkeley students as
for any class and the people who may fig
ure most prominently in the Berkeley |
section may not be ibe only ones who are j
deeply interested in its welfare. This j
promises to be the liveliest section in the i
State.
As stated in the foregoing, the lectures
of the American Branch of this City are
largely attended and iast evening's enter
tainment was as iully attended as any
preceding. The hall was not large
enough to accommodate all who desired
to He present. W. W. Wilkins presided.
There was a iutle change in the pro- j
gramme. T. M. Anthony was expected
to speak on "Progress.'' He was absent,
but ms place was ably rilled by G. B. Ben
ham, whose subject was the "Red Flag." I
Among the uninformed the red flag or !
banner is believed to be the emblem of ;
anarchy, riots, disorder and bloodshed, ,
but i: any who listened to Mr. Benham en
tertained sucb notions they were unde
ceived before the address was half over.
The address showed careful preparation,
familiarity with ancient and modern his
tory and logical reasoning. Mr. Benham,
in substance, stated tUat the red-flag
origin is la*t in antiquity. It the ll lj;
of ancient Tunis, Tripoli, Turkey and
other countries. Tho-e who recognized
the sun as the mainstay of life saw in the
flames of tire its counterpart on earth, and
sun and flames were symbolized by a
naming banner.
In mythological lore the goddesses
Ceres, Mint rva, Pomona and Proserpine, j
who presided over the food products of the
farth, were depicted as being clothed in
flaming red. This color was adopted by
the agricultural laborers, and later by all
those who toiled for their bread.
As a contrast the azure and white were
adopted by those who did not labor and
who exalted themselves by a pretense of
superiority â the azure, the grandeur of
the blue skips, the white to show that no
soil came from the grim bands of labor.
Among the toilers of ancient Athens,
Roms and other places were labor com
munes, also represented by the flaming
flag.
Coming down to more modern dates,
Mr. Benham called the attention of his
audience to the fact that in 1775, during
the War of the Revolution, General Put
nam raised a red flag on Prospect Hill,
Mass. It was then regarded by the colo
nies as an emblem of liberty. The same
belief caused a red banner to be placed
on Bunker Hill after th.it great victory
was won. While working in the same
great canse Pulaski was presented with a
crimson banner by the nuns of a convent
at Baltimore.
The Commune of Paris recognized the
flaming banner in the same way.
"So we see," said the speaker, "that it
really stands for everything that is good,
the .fellowship ot man, the industries ol
the world and the hope of the oppressed
and the downtrodden, and it stands
against everything that is bad, the op
pression anil slavery of mankind. It is
now tiie emblem of the emancipation of
the world."
FRENCH IN THE SCHOOLS
Work of Education Conducted
in This City by l'Alliance
Franca ise.
N arlv Four Hundred Pupils Being
Taught tie Mother Country's
L/ngu g>.
Charles Marais presided at the annual
meeting of l'Alliance Francaise held Sat
urday night at Union square Hall.
This institution was brought to light
some years ago by a number of patriotic
Frenchmen, at the head of wnom is Daniel
Levy, who assess themselves for the pur
pose of employing professors to teach the
French language to pupils of the local
public schools.
The executive committee made the fol
lowing gratifying report, including the
work of the organization during the year
ending December 31, 1896:
After thanking the Hoard of Education
for placine the schools and classes at the
disosal of I'Alliance the report enumer
ates the schools where classes were formed
.it the beginning of the year 1896 :ind in
which pupils to the number oi 322 were
taught, as follows: Whittier, '28; Wash
ington, 34; Hamilton, 52; Denman, 56;
Hearst, 26; Horace Mann, 60; Crocker, 22;
Le Conte, 54.
These pupils were divided into eleven
classes, six of which were organized in
November, 1895.
Some seventy-five pupils dropped out
shortly after the first of the year 1896 be
cause of lack of aptitude to learn a foreign
language or else that they had not
time to study. The remaining pupil?,
however, were enthusiastic and encouraged
the committee in its work.
With the assistance of W. W. Stone,
principal of the South San Francisco
School, and Eugene Legallet, itertrand
Salles, Jean Boyle, J. MUly and A. Corn
batalade, thirty-three pupils were secured
in that section of the Potrero never before
attended to In the work, and 140 new
members came into I'Alliance.
In March classes were established in the
Sherman, John SweU, Clement and North
Cosmopolitan schools, and at the end of
the year L' Alliance had classes in thirteen
schools ana a total of 347 pupils.
In six schools classes are held five times
each week, and in seven others three
times a weeJt.
T^e completed list of schools, teachers
and number of pupils at the present time
is as follows: Whitiier, Mrs. L. Bous
quot, 30; Wa-hington, Miss E. Itam
pillion, 29; Hamilton, Miss M. Ran>p;l-
Jion, 26; Denman, Mr. Lanfranchi, 36;
Horace Mann, Mrs. J. O^orn, 29; South
San Francisco, L. Ravault, 33; Hearst,
Mrs. E. Giffaid, 17; Crocker, Miss A.
Borci, 13; Sherman, Mrs. Ranieau, 26;
John Pwett, Mrs. Robert Burns, 17; Clem
ent, Mrs. H. Worms, 29; North Cosmo
politan. H. Lecat, 22; Le Conte, Mrs. M.
Marsuall, 40.
The discipline of these classes has been
such that neither the teachers nor the
committee have had to find objection in
any case.
The report on finances showed as fol
lows: Toial ieceipts, $3324 42: total ex
penses, $3303 05; surplus receipts, $21 37;
cost of maintaining the schools, $29Wj 4V,
receipts irom the parents of pupils,
$2208 80; surplus expenses, $757 65.
The latter deficit is so well covered by
the monthly dues of the members and by
the donations from the 14th of.July com
mittees and others that lhero is an actual
fund of $1163 50 to becin this year's work.
The members of l'Alliance Francaise
aredivid-d as follow*,: Life 2, honorary
73, contributing 230, yearly members 160.
This brinirs the number to 465, or an in
crease of 69 members in twelve months.
The election of officers resulted as fol
lows: President, Daniel Levy; executive
committee, E. Legallet. A. Goustiaux, O.
Bozio, C. Marais, E. J. Dupuy, A, J. De
hay, C. Greffe, A. Bousquet (secretary), J.

Out of the 240,000 domestic servants in
London it is estimated that 10,000 are
always out of employment.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALIi, MONDAY, JANUARY 18, 1897.
Detective Michael Arthur Conroy of Australia, One of the Most
Remarkable Professional Athletes Who Has Ever Come to
San Francisco. He Is Here to Assist in the Capture of
Butler, the Murderer, Expected to Arrive on the Swanhilda.
DETECTIVE AND
ATHLETIC STUB
Australian Sleuth Conroy a
Phenomenon on the
Track.
As Jumper, Sprinter, Vauiter,
Putter and Thrower He
Is a Wonder.
Ha Also Has a Record as Bcxer, Oars
man and Wrestler â A Mod
est Champion.
One of the two Australian detectives
sent here to capture Butler, the atrocious
murderer who escaped on the sbip Swan
hilda, is an athlete of most unusual abil
ity.
His name is Michael Arthur Conroy.
He is a native of Springfield, Victoria.
Australia, and is ~H years of age. He is
5 feet 10 inches in hcig. t, gracefully built,
and weighs 189 pounds in meager athletic
garb.
For sixteen years, or. ever since he was
a mere boy of ten, he has Deen a pro
fessional athlete, competing wherever
there were professional events in different
Darts of Australia, New Zealand and Tas
mania,
Like many other men in Australia,
where professional athletic sports attract
more attention than anywhere else in the
world, he has constantly followed the
circuit of meets and games for a living.
He has been in hundreds of competitions
and has won thousands of pounds ster
ling, or many thousands of dollars.
Here are some of his best records, all
made in competition and attested by of
ficials at the different big professional
meets in which they were made:
Running High Jump(world's record) 6 ft. 5 in.
Standing High Jump 6 tt. BVi in.
Running Broad Jump 21 ft. 10 . in.

high) â 'â â â  lessee.
200-yard Hurdles ( 6 leaps, 3 ft. 6 in.
high) 22 sec.
In addition to these surprising per
formances in sDeed and agility Conroy is
an oarsman, a boxer and a wrestler.
He is young, bright, fearless, withal
quiet and unassuming. And this is the
man that the Australian police chose to
assist In capturing 'and returning to Aus
tralia a desperate criminal of considerable
physical power.
He had been in the Police .Deportment
but one day when he was detailed to help
in the search for Butler. He joined the
Melbourne, New South Wales, police on
November 23, 1896. Before that he hud
always been an athlete by profession. The
next day he was called out and put on this
murder'case, the first and only detective
work he has done.
But he is the only man here that actu
ally knows and is known to Butler, and
upon his recognition the United States
Marshals that are to make the arrest will
be sure of their man.
From November 24 to December 12 Con
roy was busy investi-aiing the case in
Sydney, New South Wales, with Detective
Roach. On the latter date he sailed
from Sydney with Detective McHattie
in the steamship Miowera for Vic
toria, B. C, in pursuit of the murderer,
whom they had finally traced to the
Swanhilda, which find already sailed for
Han Francisco from Newcastle, the home
of Detective McHattie.
Conroy's first appearance as an athlete
was in a boys' race for a tin of sweet
biscuits. He won the prize and at once
sold it for cash. On the same day he also
won the boys' high jump and the pole
vault. That was when he was 10 years of
age.
The next season, when only 11 years of
age, he began competing in professional
events with men and won tne running
hi h jump with a leap of 5 feet 8 inches, a
performance that fully developed collecre
athletes on this roast consider unusually
good, particularly when it is remembered
that the Pacific Coast amateur record was
very little better than that until the last
few years. That same year he also tied
for first place in the pole vault by clearing
9 feet 9 inches in competition with old
professionals. From that time on he de
veloped steadily year by year oa his size
and strength increased.
When 19 years of age he cleared 6 feet
3% inches in the running high jump,
which is his star performance. He haa
competed 242 times in this one event and
has never been beaten from the scratch.
At Melbourne in the exhibition tames on
St Patrick's day, 1891, he conceded twelve
inches to his best opponent and then won.
Though his best attested performance in
regular competition for a prize is 6 feet 5
inches, made at Warehouseman's cricket
â rounds, St. Hilda road, Melbourne, in
1891, be cleared the bar while in practice
for that match at the height of 6 feet 7'^
inches. This performance was witnessed
and measured by Professor William Mil
ler, now an athletic Instructor in Mel
bourne, but formerly well known in this
City, and by P. H. Reynolds of the Royal
Mail Hotel, Bourke street, Melbourne.
In the games at Jerilderiej New South
Wcles, in 1892, there were thirteen events.
Cnnroy entered them all. He won twelve
first places and tied for the other. On
that occasion ne established his record of
47 feet and 4 inches in the running hop,
step and jump.
In 1888 at Geelong, Victoria, he made
his record of 11 feet 1 inch in the pole
vault. How good that in may be inferred
from the fact that the present Pacific
Coast record is 10 feet 10J- 2 ' inches made
last April by Dole, the great Stanford vole
vauiter. But C'onroy equaled this latter
record last St. Patrick's Day in a contest
at the Sydney Cricket Grounds.
His standing high jump record of 5 feet
RJ^ inches was made in the games at Al
bury, N. S. W., in April, 1895. That record
alone would here be considered creditable
for the running event, though only last
year Patter>on of the Olympic Club and
little Bert Kerrigan, then of the Multno
mab Athletic Club of Portland, but now
of Stanford University, both cleared the
Dar at 6 feet 2 inches, and surprised the
athletic world on this coast by establish
ing a record not approximated before in
the West. His record in the running
broad jump, 21 feet 10 inches, was made
at Melbourne in 1891. It does not, how
ever, compare favorably with his other
performances when contrasted with rec
ords on this coast. His record of 27 feet
for three standing backward jumps was
mode at ihe Crystal Palace, Melbourne,
in 1890.
Hi- put the 56-pound weight 20 feet. 8
inches in the games at Murchison, Vic
toria, Australia, and he threw the sanre
weight 29 feet 4 inches at Hobart Town,
Tasmania.
In 1890, at the Melbourne Exhibition
Building, he won both the ail-comers'
wrestling contests against nine competi
tors each time. These are the only wrest
ling contests be has entered.
In the sprints his records were all re
corded by Baird's automatic judging ma
chine, which is supposed to make none of
the mistakes so frequent among timers
using stop watches. He covered seventy
five yards on the Lilly Bridge Running
Grounds in Sydney last yearirom a stand
ing start in 8 seconds. The 100 yards he
made in 9;g seconds and the others aa in
dicated in the list of records above.
When Walter Henry ol the University
of California established at the Olympic
grounds in 1893 a world's amateur record
of 15% seconds for the 120-yard hurdles
his record was looked upon as phenomenal.
Conroy as a professional hns covered the
same distance over the same obstacles in
14]4 seconds, though that is over a second
away from the world's professional record.
In some years Conroy has competed in
over 200 events, and in Sydney contested
continuously once for six days during a
big nieei. In most of these professional
contests there is a cash prize of at least
Â£50. or $250, to the winner. Often it is
Â£100, or $500. In one event in 1889 the
first prize, won by Conroy, was over $1600.
Is addition to the big cash prizes Con
roy has won twenty-four gold medals and
has four trophy cups, ail of which are
twenty-five inches in height.
He modestly says that he wonld like to
go in for some athletic contests while he
ia here, though so far his time has not
been his own.

and requires, one might say, years of
study and hard work."
When asked how Chicago audiences
compared with those of New York she
said:- "I think the audiences in Chicago
are most discriminating; in fact all Amer
ican audiences are very difficult to please.
You see they have the very best that can
be bad, and 1 do not think they are very
hospitable to newcomers.
"Yes, ibey are harder to please than
foreign audiences, and do not show their
pleasure so quickly. Americans are very
quick to make up their minds as to what
tney like and what they don't like. For
eigners take more time in judging and
give the articles a little more chance for
their lives," she said, laughingly. "Here
we are apt to judge in one performance,
and if it does not piease we have not much
use for it."
Madame was asked if "stage fright" ever
claimed her for its own.
"Stage fright ! Oh, horrors, always! It
just made me shiver to think of it as we
were coming here. Of course in opera one
does not become so nervous; there are
more distractions. There are the 'demons'
fiddling away below and the 'head dcvii'
waving his baton, bat in concert â oh !
Every hand goes up so, and every heail
bobs this way and that way, aud, well, 1
don't think one ever really gets over it â
stage fripht I mean."
Mme. Nordica would not speak directly
concerning the Metropolitan Opera-house
affair, but incidentally observed that she
thought it was unfair that "odo man or
woman should receive four or five times
as much, as his 'running mate,' so to
speak."
"I think," she saitl, "for any one artist
in a company to take upon himself to dis
tribute roles or to say who shall do one
thing and who the other is wrong. Re
muneration should be controlled more by
the managers and less by tne artists, and
then there would be a better understand
ing all around."
Mme. Nordica does not expect to sing
in any other part of this State, although
she expressed a hope that arrangements
might be perfected regarding a northern
trip which she intended to take after her
engagement in this City, but about which
she appeared rather dubious.
The beginning of March will see the fair
American prima donna fulfilling a two
months' engagement at the Opera-bouse
in Paris, after which she will sing in Lon
don at the Covent Garden Theater.
The other members of the company
arriving last niph' were Mme. Scalchi, the
famous contralto, who is in splendid voice;
Barron BerthalU, tenor; J. C. Dempsey,
basso; and Isidore Lucksione, pianist and
conductor of the orchestra of fiity.
