Turkey Appears to Be Ready
for Larger Game Than
Greece*
HOWEVER, THE HELLENES ARE
EAGER FOR PEACE.
Full Authority Given the Representatives of
the Six Meddlesome Nations to Proceed
With Negotiations With the
Sultan*
ATHENS, GREECE, May ii. â The German Minister received in
structions from Berlin at midnight last night to co-operate with other
representatives of the powers to the end of concluding peace. Upon
the strength of this the foreign Ministers immediately called upon M.
Skouloudis, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and presented to him the col
lective note offering to arrange an armistice and conclude peace. The
Greek Government, through Skouloudis, at once accepted these terms
and confided their interests to the powers. The latter will take meas
ures at Constantinople to check the advance of the Turkish army
â¢under Edham Pasha. The collective note of the powers offering to
arrange an armistice and conclude peace was presented to M. Skou
loudis by the Russian Minister, M. Onou.
There is a feeling of intense relief here at the ending of the war
Premier Ralli, interviewed to-day, said that the Government consented
to confide the interests of Greece to the powers, because he was con
fident they would refuse to leave an inch of Grecian territory in the
hands of the Sultan. Nevertheless the opinion seems to prevail in
â¢ministerial circles that Turkey will . not consent to readily obey the
powers.
LONDON, ENG., May n. â In the House of Commons to-day
. Arthur J. Balfour said in reply to a question by John Morley that the
representatives of the powers at Athens had offered to undertake medi
ation between Greece and Turkey, and that the offer had been accepted
by the Greek Government.
LONDON, Esq., May 11.â Many specu
lations are indulged in regarding the
terms of peace that will be imposed by
the powers, but nothing definite as to
their character is known.
The Athens correspondent of the Stand
ard says he learns from good sources that
they will include the re-establishment of
â¢ the territorial status which obtained be
fore the war, some kind of international
control of Greek finances, and possibly
payment by Greece of a small indemnity.
Advices from Vienna state that tne
Porte calculates the cost of the war at
Â£6,000,000 (Turkish), while he will require
Greece to pay in yearly installments se
cured by mortgaging the revenues of
Thessaly to Turkey, which will raise a
loan thereon. Turkey also, according to
the same advices, claims a rectification of
the Thessahan frontier.
According to the Daily News the Greeks
rely upon Great Britain to protect iheir
interests, and adherents of the Porte are
looking for help from Russia and Ger
many.
A dispatch to the Daily News from
Athens says that the troops in Thessaly
and Eplrus were promptly informed of
the pending armistice. The dispatch adds
that it is hoped that the armistice will
calm public excitement and pave thÂ» way
for the disbanding of the troops and vol
unteers and heterogeneous elements of the
army, which endanger public peace.
The Daily News' Constantinople corre
spondent telegraphs that general satisfac
tion is felt there over the fact that Greece
has applied for mediation. The Turks
wish to treat with Greece directly, and
the decision of the powers to manage the
negotiations is unwelcome.
A dispatch from Athens to the Chroni
cle says that during the negotiations pre
ceding the note of the powers to Greece
the majority of the powers assured Greece
that the terms of peace would favor her.
The writer of the dispatch, on authority
of Colonel Manos and other leaders in
Epirus, reaffirms that the Turks were
guilty of many atrocities in frontier vil
lages. He declares that all women and
children who did not escape were massa
cred and the villages burned. Fugitives
sobbingly relate stories of the slow killing
of childien in the presence of their moth
ers and of girls being assaulted in the
presence of their sisters. A number of
women of Kamarina, while fleeing to
Mount Zalongos, were pursued by Turks
and leaped down a precipice to escape
them, preferring death to dishonor and
torture. \
The Standard's Constantinople dispatch
says that reports persist that remarkable
war preparations continue, and the dis
patch cites as instances of these the fact
that several regiments in Asia have been
summoned for service in Europe. The
reports cause much anxiety, inasmuch as
such increases are not required even in
The San Francisco Call
I the event of negotiations with Greecs
j collapsing. They seem to indicate that
Turkey is preparing for some bigger foe,
or intends to so strengthen herself in
Europe as to enable her to follow her own
course regardless of the powers. The con
sensus of opinion is that the prevalent
war spirit will give the powers as much
trouble to enforce their wishes in Constan
tinople as they had in Athens.
The dispatch adds that six officers from
Janina and the army of commandants at
Louios, Phillipada and other stations
have arrived at Constantinople in chains
and nnder strong escorts. They will be
placed on trial for neglecting tbeir duty
in the face of the enemy.
The Standard's Athens correspondent
states that it is reported fighting occurred
to-day at Dhomoko and Almyro.
The Athens correspondent of the Times
says that arrangements now reached have
only in view the cessation of hostilities
as a preliminary to the conclusion of
peace. No discussion of the terms has
vet been initiated, lt is hoped that the
diplomats will, exert the utmost pressure
on the Porte to obtain an immediate
armistice, as it is leared the dilatory
methods .of the Porte will again be re
sorted to with the idea of gaining further
successes and better terms. The report
adds that the Government received tele
grams that Edhem Pasha is preparing to
attacK Smolenski, who is strongly en
trenched near SurpL
Tbe Times Constantinople dispatch says
that the representatives of the powers in
that city met to-day. Two lacked instruc
tions from their governments and con
sequently there was merely an exchange
of views, no. action being taken.

Terrible .Hardships and Nesrlect

LONDON, Eng., May ILâ Mailed dis
patches from English reporters continue
to unfold a story of disorganization and
neglect in the Greek army. The corre
spondent of the Daily Mail, under date of
Arta, Apiil 25, relates that the Sixth Regi
ment when at Filippiada received at au
early hour on the morning of the -23d
bread and water for the men. After
ward the. regiment marched by easy
stages to the neighborhood of Pentepi
gbadia, arriving at 6 o'clock in the even
ing. No provisions of any kind arrived
that night. The next , morning the men
still had nothing : to; eat, but they were
ordered to march back to Filippiada. The
poor fellows began to retreat, but many
were unable to keep in the ranks, and tbe
roadsides were lined with hundreds who
hud sunk down Irom hunger and fatigue.
The Turks, who were only a few miles be
hind, could, if , they had advanced,: have
annihilated tbem.
There were no, supplies at; Filippiada,
and when, the writer left on the after
noon of April 24 the regiment was still
unfed. , Upon . reaching Arta the writer
found a similar.; condition of affairs. A

THE CONFERENCE AT PARIS JANUARY, 1869, Wich Settled the Last Trouble Between
Greece and Turkey and Averted the Threatened War.
This conference met at Paris January 15, 1869, in the Salle de Congress of the
Palace of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and continued its sittings during three
days. The result of their work was that Greece, left without support, was \ com
pelled to accept the ultimatum laid down by, Turkey, and the impending hostili
ties over the Cretan question were averted at least for the time and the Cretan
rebellion, which had been going on since 18G6, died out of its own motion within a
few months. .
The circumstances under which this conference was called admitted- of no
delay, as Turkey and Greece were about to fly at each other's throats. The Turkish
Embassador at Athens, Photiades Bey, had on the 11th of December presented to
Premier Delyannis an ultimatum from the Porte whicb meant war. -On December
17, France, Austria and Prussia united in a request for a conference, with a view
of mediation. It was agreed to by all, and the Ministers and Embassadors of the
several powers at Paris were empowered by their respective Governments to act
for them. They convened on January 15 and adjourned on the 17th. Though
thus made upâ hastily, and as it were, of such material as was immediately avail
ableâit included some of the ablest diplomats of the day and men of much special
experience in the Eastern question.
The president was the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Marquis de
Lavalette, who had served as secretary to the Embassy to Persia in 1835, as Con
sul-General to Egypt and twice as Embassador to Constantinople. Lord Lyons
represented Great Britain, having lately succeeded Lord Cowley as Embassador to
.Paris. He had formerly been an attache of the British Embassy at Athens and after
crowd of soldier? on the main street, ren
dered almost mad by hunger, attacked a
provision store, the doors of which they
battered down with their ; rifles. Then
followed a wild rush to secure food. A
colonel rode up and tried to disperse the
men. He was surrounded in a moment
by a starving mob, who, regardless or dis
cipline, seized the reins and stirrups and
clamored for bread.
Elsewhere the writer saw 200 soldiers
fighting to obtain from a bag of tobacco
lying on the street a portion: to appease
their hunger. Colonel Manos, com
mander-in-chief of ., the Eastern' army,
finally arrived and appealed to the men to
maintain order.
ATHENS, Greece, May 11.â Advices

the Greek army at Dhomoko has col
lapsed, and that bread and cheese are the
sole rations of the troops. Crown Prince
Constantino yesterday issued a proclama
tion to the army, saying that the position
at Dhomoko was so strong that it ; may be
considered invincible. He added that he
was confident the army would not only
repulse every attack, but it would shortly
be able to resume the offensive and drive
the enemy from Greek territory. In con
clusion the Crown Prince expressed sym
pathy for the men in their privations and
appealed to their patriotism.

throughout the war the Turks, owing to
their policy of throwing such immense
bodies of troops against strong positions,
lost 12.000, while the Greek losses were
only 1000 all told.

â¢ The wreck was seen 100 miles off Queen
Charlotte Island. It was floating right
side up, while the seas broke over the
ward Minister successively to Florence (Tuscany), Washington and Constantinople.
Austria's interests were looked after by Prince Metternich, the son of the great
Metternich of Napoleon's time. In the absence of M. de Gottz, the Prussian Minis
ter, King William spoke through his charge d'affaires at Paris, Count Salmo
Sonnenwalde. The Chevalier Nigra, schooled in diplomacy under Count Cavour,
represented Italy and Lieutenant-General yon Stachelberg Russia. The interests
of tho Sublime Porte were voiced by Djemil Pasha, who had twice before repre
sented the Sultan at the French court, and those of Greece by M. Rizas Rangabi,
formerly rector of the University at Athens, and at the same time Minister of the
King's Household and Minister of Foreign Affairs.
They agreed among themselvesâ first, that they would only consider the im
mediate cause of the breach between Turkey and Greece, and second, that in case
they were unable to adjust- matters satisfactorily, that their respective govern
ments would remain neutral and be simple spectators of any war that might fol
low. Greece found that she would have to stand alone, and, feeling unaole to do
so, accepted the ] ultimatum of the Porte in regard to ber interference and en
couragement of the insurgents in Crete, with such modifications as were suggested
by, the conference.
M. Rangabi took no active part in the deliberations, as he thought that his
country was not placed on an equal footing with Turkey. The conclusions ar
rived at by the conference were carried to King George at Athens by the late
Count WalewsKi, together with an autograph letter from Emperor Napoleon 111/
urging conciliatory and peaceful measures, which had a large effect in insuring the
same. ?*%Â£s '."V;' "
hall. '_. The Ainsworth got close enough to
the wrecked vessel at one lime to see the
body of a man lashed to the stern davits
and to discern a gold* ring. on. the third
ringer of the left hand. The corpse waa
that of a roan apparently of medium size,
with dark hair and dark mustache. ,. .
This entry concerning the discovery was
taken from the log of the Ainsworth:
May Passed 'the wreck of the schooner
General J Siglin, . at ' 0\ a. .m.J In > latitude " 53
degrees 15 \ minutes * N.,'; longitude ' 135 ; de
grees 15 minutes W. ' She was dismantled and

were breaking over her. > *. .'. '-â¢-'â¢>â¢â ;'
p: .There was a dead -body lashed to the stern
davits. There was a high sea running, so it
was Impossible for us to board her. ....
w Just where or when the General Siglin
encountered the storm which wrecked
the vessel, , a matter for â¢ the widest con
jecture. Enough ,is known, however, to
almost preclude the possibility of a hope
for the captain and passengers, or a single
member of the crew of six shipped from
San Francisco. .
Local seafaring men say it is hardly
within the range of possibilities that the
General Siglin was wrecked, in the same
storm as that which destroyed the, Sama
ria, which went to pieces off Cape Flat
tery. , Captain Crockett .is also of, that
opinion. â  '-**-**"">' -b r -'. *
' "She could not have drifted that, far,"
he observed, "on account of being water-!
logged. .It is my opinion that the General
Siglin was lost in the storm which raged
off Queen Charlotte Islands from March 21
to March 25. During those days the wiud
blew almost a hurricane, and, in fact, 'we
lost our rudder. The chances are that
the General Siglin met her 'fate very near
where ;we sighted her. She could not
gone far. being probably drifted only by ~
tbe tide.' â -*.'- â  -" t > â¢;"'." -
"I hardly think it possible that : the
General Siglin was lost other : than in a
storm. She was not run down. I took
particular notice of the vessel Ito see if
she was cut, but she was not, her hull ap
parently being- intact. :When the mast
was carried away it ripped up her deck,
causing the vessel to fill with water. ;
"We went by her twice, and I tried hard
to see il the man lashed to the davits was
the master. I was particularly anxious
about this, as Captain Thomas was a
warm personal friend of raine. I am
quite certain it was not Captain Thomas,
for the body was attired in an oilskin
suit, being apparently a sailor's outfit.
Whoever he may have been he made a
desperate effort to prevent being washed
overboard, as the others doubtless were.
He was most securely lathed to the davits.
"Lashed to the " davits . also were several
small boxes, which t> probably contained
the ship's papers. , Owing to the high seas
I did not feel justified in attempting to
get aboard the Siglin, especially as no one
remained alive aboard of her." ,~ ,
James Chilberg, one of the worth's
crew, said the sight presented by the
corpse on the vessel, was the most sicken
ing he had ever witnessed. In the place
of eyes were gaping sockets, and the man's
features bore traces of terrible sufferings.
-The Siglhi's mainmast was trailing
astern, X held by the shrouds, j The fore
batch and steering gear were in place and
the anchors hung fast at the catheads.
Chi; berg's theory is that the vessel was
jibed in a heavy sea and that its , masts
went by the board.' The Ainsworth tacked
up to the wreck twice in an endeavor to
obtain a clew to the mystery, but was
finally compelled, to abandon the derelict,
which is directly in the path of the north
ern fleet and a constant menace to naviga
tion.". :.' *':. ... 'i.p!>-'-",CKv:. : â  ' :.-'. -V

Lucy B Overhauls an Ameri

WASHINGTON, D. CL, May ILâ
State Department has received a dispatch
from Consul Little at Tegucigalpa, capital
of Honduras, stating that the revolution
has ended. The telegram furnishes node
tails of the events surrounding the col
lapse. X v
NEW ORLEANS, La., May 11.â The
American steamer Rover, Captain* R. V.
Reed, arrived to-day from Honduras. The
vessel brings reports of great excitement
growing out of the revolution. A big bat
tle was fought at Puerto Cortez and the
American Consul there, W. Alger, is said
to have been killed.
The Rover reached Puerto Cortez May
6. As there was great excitement and the
forces there were preparing for battle, and
as no flags were flying over the American
Consulate, Reed deemed it dangerous to
land and sailed for Omoa. Four miles out
the Rover, while flying the American flag,
was fired on by the Lucy B, the Nicara
guan gunboat, which, under command of
General Rayes, had been sent by Nicara
gua to the assistance of Honduras. The
Rover stopped at the first shot, but a sec
ond struck within * few feet of the engine
house. !
Rayes then boarded the Rover and
searched her thoroughly on suspicion that
she was bringing supplies to the revolu
tionists. Reed protested against the firing
on and searching of a friendly vessel.
Rayes replied that he did not give a
for Americans, as the revolution was in
stigated and carried on . by Americans.
Finding no contraband articles the Rover
was released and proceeded on her way.
On the return trtp, two days later, the
Rover passed within a few miles of Puerto
Cortez. The town was studied at a dis
tance through a fielaglass, and it was evi
dent that a battle had been fought there.
The Lucy B was lying at the wharf, but
was badly dismantled, the pilot-house
and bulwarks were shot away. Tbere was
no evidence that the town itself had suf
fered any serious damage from the fight,
but the fact that the Lucy B had landed
would seem to indicate that the Govern
ment troops * had defeated the revolu
tionists and captured the town.
A short distance from Puerto Cortez
Captain Reed heard that W. S. Alger, the
American Consul, was killed the day pre
vious. *-,*' Alger was charged with . being in
sympathy with the revolutionists, and, in
fact, one of the ringleaders.' Nearly all
the Americans in Puerto Cortez .sympa
thize with the revolutionists.
The impression prevailed that the battle
fought at Puerto Cortez mast in conse
quence have been bloodier "than the usual
Central American battles.
Captain Reed will enter a protest with
the United States authorities against the
action *of the JSicaraguans in firing on
and searching his vessel.

The Need of Coaling Stations;
Shown by Cummings of
New York.
But It Is Voted That There Is No
Present Necessity for an
Appropriation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 11. -By the j
decisive vote of S6 to 53 the House in com- j
mittee of the whole to-day non-concurred J
in the Senate amendment to the sundry |
civil bill appropriating $50,000 for the im- !
provement of Pearl harbor, Hawaii. It |
was strongly advocated by Hitt of Illinois,
chairman of the Committee on Foreign
Affairs of the last House, who explained
the terms of the Hawaiian treaty. Reply
inn to a question, Hitt said the matter
bore no relation to tbe question of annexa
tion, for if the Hawaiian Islands were ac
quired the necessity would still exist for a
coaling station. "One of the things neces
sary," he said, "is to bold it. Let us go
in there and plant the flag, and it will not
come down in a thousand years." [Ap
plause.]
Cummings (D.) of New York said the
United States Government had been
awarded 000, 000 by the Geneva arbi
tration tribunal, in return for which it
had yielded the assumption that coal was j
a contraband of war. That was a time
when Great Britain had 271 coaling sta
tions and the United States had not one.
He might be induced to vote against it
because be bad confidence in the patriot
ism and Americanism of William Mc-
Kinley and believed that before bis term
of office expired the Hawaiian Islands
would be an integral part of the United
States [great applause), but be would vote
for the amendment
Hitt' was also ably aided by Simpson
(Pop.) and others, but could not overcome
the opposition led by Cannon (R.) of Illi
nois, who contended that there was no
present necessity for the appropriation.
Sayers (D.) of Texas said that stalking
behind the appropriation was the spectre
of annexation and territorial aggrandize
ment, and be would raise a note of warn
ing to bis Democratic associates.
The Senate amendment relating to
forest reservations was non-concurred in,
bat was agreed to in conference after some
modifications.
The Senate amendment taxing from the
classified service the appointment of
twelve commissioners to classify the
mineral lands of the Northern Pacific
grant was concurred in.
The sundry civil bill was tben disposed
of and a conference ordered upon items
still in dispute, wben an adjournment was
taken until Thursday.

Central Park Suicide Mystery Sotted.
NEW YORK. N. V.. May 11.-The mys
terious suicide whose body was found in
the reservoir in Central Park' yesterday
has been fully identified as Mrs. E. G.
Reiss of Brooklyn. The discovery of her
body in the reservoir caused a decided sen
sation. She was a beautiful and fashiona
bly dressed woman, and the first theory
was that death was the result of an acci
dent. /Later discoveries, however/proved
conclusively that it was a case of suicide.
LIBERAL TORY IR 'QUEBEC.
Overwhelming Defeat of the Conservative
Candidates Throughout the
Province.
OTTAWA, Ont., May 11.â The Quebec
provincial election- were held to-day and
resulted in the overwhelming defeat of
the Conservative Government. .Returns
from all constituencies to-night give
twenty Conservatives and flity-three Lib
erals. The magnitude of the Liberal vic
tory is a surprise to both political parties.
'With the Manitoba school question and
the bait offered in the completion of the
Bale dcs Ctialeurs Railroad, including the
expenditure of several millions of dollars,
working in favor of the Government, it
was thought that the Conservatives would
win.
The presence of the Papal Ablegate in
the country in a great measure prevented
any active and open interf .rone j by the
Catholic hierarchy.
The letter from the Ablegate was pub
lished a few days ago, in which he depre
cated clerical interference with the right
of the people to vote as their consciences
dictated, and this evidently accounts for
the tremendous Liberal majorities cast.
Premier Flynn was defeated by a nar
row majority in his own county. It is
now an accepted fact that the Manitoba
school" question has received its quietus,
Marcnand, the Opposition leader, having
been decorated by the French Department
of Public Instruction. The Liberal suc
cess is largely due to the growing desire
to escape priestly domination in Federal
affairs and to mars it 3 sympathy with
Lauder's opposition thereto, and as such
the victory is much less Marchand's than
it is Laurier's.
ROT IR VITED AS A GUEST.
There Is Not Room Enough to Honor
Washington's Great-Great- Grandnephew
at the Unveiling Ceremonies.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., May 11.âPer
miss on to witness the unveiling of the
Washington monument as a guest of the
society has been refused to the great-great
granduephew of General George Wash
ington by the committee in charge. The
gentleman disappointed is George Steptoe
Washington; and he resides here. No
doubt his claims for recognition are well
founded. Ten days ago the committee
received a letter from Mr. Washington
asking for an invitation to the stand.
The committee replied yesterday that the
demands for tickets were so great it would
be impossible to comply. Washington is
manager of the wholesale grocery firm
of Robert Company. He is known to all
the committee and belongs to the Sons of
the Revolution. He says:
"I am descended from Augustine ami
Colonel Samuel Washington, brothers of
George. My father was born and reared
at Mount Vernon and his brother was the
last owner. My father still lives at Har
wood, W. Va,. on the homestead built by
Colonel Samuel Washington. Dolly Madi
son was married there."
KANSAS FARMERS FRIGHTENED.
From Phillips Coun Comes a Story ot
the Doings of a Reptile F.it/
Feet Long.'
TOPEKA, Kaks.. May 11. â Postmaster
Walker of Logan, Kans., is authority for
the story that farmers of Crystal Creek,
Phillips County, are greatly excited at the
appearance of an enormous rentile, which
they say is fifty feet long. It has a snake's
body, but two horns. Its color is green,
with dirty white tpots. It eats small ani
mals, principally fowl. One farmer lost
forty pigs in forty-eight hours. Another
testifies that the monster killed a plow
horse, which was feeding near the creek,
by a single blow of its enormous tail. It
was shot at several times, but its hide was
proof against bullets. When in anger it
lifts its head ten feet in the nir and pro
trudes its tongue three feet or more and
utters a cry like a puppy crying for its
mother. It hides in a swamp. It is sup
posed the reptile came from the deeper
water of Salmon River. Farmers bave
organized a party to hunt the monster
down.
OH PERS lit SEVERE.
Charges the Knights of Labor With An-
tagonisttlj Unionism.
LONDON Eng., May 11.â A radical
weekly paper of great circulation an
nounces in its labor column the receipt
from Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation, of "a strong con
demnation of the organization known as
the Knights ot Labor." â '"
The paper goes on to say: "He calls it
a 'moribund concern, guilty of many acts
of perfidy toward labor.' and says they
bave 'combined with unfair employers to
resist the efforts of workingmen's unions
who were fighting for union wages and
union conditions.' .;;&:
"Gompers characterizes the organization
and its action as 'desperate, contemptible
and unscrupulous.' " '
The publication has caused a big sen
sation among the laboring classes here,
and many think that Gompers has been
rather severe in his strictures.
On the other hand tbere are those who
say tbat Gompers took the proper course
in denouncing an organization which was
antagonistic to the American Federation,
lt is just possible that some of the labor
organizations here may take a hand in the

PLANS FOR GOMEZ
BAFFLE WEYLER
Movements of the Cuban
Leader Excite the
4 Spaniards.
His Aggressive Operations In
Matanzas Carefully
Concealed.
Depositors Refuse Paper Money for
Gold and Raid a Bank at
Havana.
HAVANA, Cuba, May 11. -The pres
ence of Gomez in ihe western end of the
province of Matanzas is confirmed. Go
mez has been in Matanzas since last week,
but the Spanish authorities have kept the
fact carefully concealed. The plan of
Gomez appears to be to return to Santa j
Clara province soon. I
General Weyler was compelled by Go
mez's movement to the west to send to
Matanzas and Havana provinces the bulk
of his forces, 60 000 men, near Jucaro
Moron trocha. The excitement produced
by Gomez's proximity has not impelled
the Spanish merchants in Havana to ac
cept paper money at par with gold. - *
The Spanish Bank of the Island of Cuba
has not closed its door- , as was reported,
but there was a raid on tbe bank yester
day by more than 2000 persons, who over
powered the guard of tbe bank and de
manded that the cashier give gold for its
own bank notes. The police were sum
moned, and to calm the mob the bank
authorities appealed to tbe patriotism of
the Spaniards present and promised that
the paper- money question would soon be
settled. A revolution of the Spaniards
themselves in Havana may be a result of
the financial distress impending.
Weyler has taken the. field. Prior to bis
departure he stated that he intended to
iii.lv protect the peasants concentrated in
town,*, and added that be had given or
ders to deliver unlimited passes to all
pacincos wbo wished to go into the coun
try to gather vegetables. In conclusion
he stated that bis principil purpose was
to reconstruct the country in the swiftest
aad surest way.

AS TO BELLIGhREXI RIGHTS.
Morgan's Resolution to Heeognlse Cubans
Is /Us cits ted.
WASHINGTON. D. C. May 11.â The
Morgan Cuban resolution was discussed at
some length to-day in tbe Senate, Mor
rill making a long speech against it. He
objected to wresting from the Executive
the right of recognizing belligerents'
rights. Spain, more surely than any
larger nation, would be likely to resent by
war any formal declaration by the United
States of Spain's incompetency to main
tain her sovereign ty in Cuba. Nations of
Europe, if they ever accepted the Mon
roe doctrine, were unlikely to accept any
new and botched verson of it set up by an
American jingoist. He spoke of the
United States as the "masked guardian
and fighting champion of all the repub
lics, big and little, or North and South
America,' in their difficulties and disputes
with European nations." : â¢,..
To carry out this character we ought to
create an army and fleet strong enough to
eclipse all that could be combined against
it. He contrasted the moderate language
of Monroe with recent "war whoops in
Congress.
"Prosperity," he said in conclusion,
"can only come from years of peace and
industry that will give the laborer the
American standard of remuneration, give
to capital some exemption from sudden
changes, and the whole country an era of
good common-sense and conservatism."
The debate was taken part In by Fo ra
ker. Allen, Mills, Lodge, Stewart of Ne
vada, Caffery and Chandler, none of whom
took an extreme view of the question in
either- way, except Stewart, who de
manded immediate action. The resolu
tion went over for iirrther consideration.

REIRSTATEMERT OF VETERARS.
Many' Deserving Old Soldiers Who Were
Thrust Out by Cleveland Will Again
Find Employment.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 11.â Four
years ago tbe coming Decoration day
about thirty veterans of the war were dis
missed from positions they held at the
Philadelphia mint and their places sup
plied by Democrats. Nearly every one of
the thirty has applied for the office he
held, and Secretary Gage in investigating
has discovered the removals to have all
been made on the annual memorial oc
casion of old . soldiers. : He has now de
cided that nearly, if not all. the dismissed
mint employes deserve their old positions,
and with grim humor has set Decoration
day as the day on which the restorations
shall occur. ?/t ;-**â '.:
The rush of veterans dismissed by the
Cleveland administration to secure -.heir
former berths is unprecedented, and caus
ing President M '/Kinley great embarrass
ments, inasmuch as many veterans are
incapacitated from performing their old
duties. Many reappointments have been
refused, but reinstatements continue so
fast that there is talk of a protest from
the Civil Service Commission that the
wholesale reinstatement of veterans is a
violation of the spirit of the civil service
law.

About Sixty* Persons Are Known
to Have Perished on the Isle
of Guadeloupe.
NEW YORK, N.Y., May 11.-Some
particulars of the earthquakes that stirred
the Leeward Islands almost at hourly in
tervals during the week ending April 23
were brought here to-day by the steam
ship Madiana of the Quebec Company's
fleet. One of the islands affected was
Montserrat, inhabited chiefly by negroes.
The Madiana dropped anchor off the chief
town of the island, which is made up of
less than 200 houses, on April 25. All
hands went ashore, and were surprise at
the funereal aspect of the place. Every
body was at church or attending one of
the numerous revivals that had been
going on since the first earthquake split
the walls of all the two-story brick build
ings on the sugar plantations of the
islands and threw down a dozen or more
flimsily constructed dwellings. Nobody
was killed at Montserrat, but about sixty
persons lost tbeir lives at Guadeloupe.
Durintr the two days that the ship was
at Montserrat revival and prayer meetings
were held cv ry hour. The shocks had
ceased then, but the whole population
was tremulous with fear, and priests and
Protestant ministers had more work than
they could attend to. Everybody was so
pious that the officers and crew of the
Madiana felt as if they bad been visiting
a cemetery. All the brick bouses were
deserted, and only substantial frame
structures, built on piles, were used to
sleep in. Many spent day and night in
the open air. St. Kitts and Antigua were
also affected, but tbere was no loss of life
except on Guadeloupe.

No Further Hope for the loung New

NEWARK, N. J.. May 11.â All hope for
a commutation of the sentence of death
that hangs over Elmer Clauson, the
young Somerville, N. J., murderer, has
been abandoned by his counsel.' He will
be banged to-morrow.
Clauson's crime was peculiarly brutal
and inexcusable and the oniy' hope ever
bad of a commutation of bis sentence lay
in his possible moral irresponsibility.
At the end of his first trial last Septem
ber, when the verdict of murder: in the
first degree was brought in by the jury,
so great was the doubt on this point that
many influential persons ... seriously
thought of making a plea for mercy in
his behalf before the Court of Pardons,
but certain . things ' that developed after
the trial convinced them that the verdict
was just and they made no recommenda
tion to the Court of Pardons. In spite of
this, from time to time reports have
come of the probable commutation of his
sentence, but they have all proved erro

PERRY, O. T., May IL â Creek and

GRADUALLY GROWING WHITE.
The Phenomenal Case of a Girl Born
of a Black Mother and a
Mulatto Father..
WICHITA, Kans.. May 11.â A which
is attracting wide-spread attention in
medical and scientific circles is that of
Delia Mayfield, a sixteen-year-old colored
girl living in Ardmore, Indian Territory,
whose skin is gradually 'â¢ growing white.
The girl's mother, who is a coal-black
negress, is employed in the family of one
of the Federal officers and her father is
said to be a mulatto.
About five years ago white snots began
to appear on the girl's body. These have
spread until her entire body is now said
to be white. Her face, neck, armi and
hands are spotted, the dark splotches
being irregular in size and largely pre
dominating. Delia has regular features,
large, dark-brown, liquid eyes, straight
dark hair and thin red lips. As the dark
skin disappears' from ber face it is replaced
by a ciear, pinKish complexion that any
society belle might envy. If the change
in the color of her skin continues as in
the past in less than two yean' time the
girl will be entirely white.
She had an offer last fall to travel and
exhibit herself with Ringling Brothers'
circus, which she declined. Medical
authorities differ as to the causes that
produce the change in color, but the con
sensus of opinion is that a disease is de
stroying the coloring matter of tne skin,
which ieaves the cuticle white. If that is
tbe case the colored people of her neigh
borhood are praying that the disease may
be contagious.

Project Through an Oversight.
WASHINGTON, D. C. May. 11â It is
reported here that the Nicaraguan Gov
ernment, through United States Minister
Baker, has assured the Secretary of State
that the notice filed with o;ney v last Janu

its charter was owing altogether to a mis
take. The notice was made public in a

oversight in not noticing that tbe commu
nication was marked "confidential."
Soon after that incident the president of
the canal company appeared before the
Senaie Committee on Foreien Affairs and
recited the actual condition of affairs.
The testimony was laid before Sherman,
who made it tie basU for a rather sharo
letter to President Zelaya of Nicaragua,
with the result that the latter has informed
Sherman that the communication was
sent to Oiney under a misunderstanding.
Those who have a knowledge of
Zelaya's letter are confident that the
action of the Nicaraguan Government
was due largely to British influences, as
charged by Morgan in the Senate at the
time. â¢;-.â ."_â " â â ':.'â :: 'â  ' â 
TEA GOING LIKE HOT CAKES.
Great Advance in Prices, but Speculators
Peel Insecure.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 11.-The tea
market has developed great activity with
in the past few days. All grades have ad
vanced from 3to 5 cents a pound. The
rise is in anticipation of a tariff of 10 cents
a pound upon tea. One prominent dealer
said to-day: "Tea is going like hot cakes.
We have disposed of 16,000 packages dur
ing the past few days." .
Importers have cabled to Japan to se
cure as much as possible of the new crop
for Immediate shipment to this country.
It will he impossible, however, to fill
many of the orders, as the present time is
between crop seasons and the amount
purchasable in Japan is comparatively
small. Speculators are greatly restricted
in their operations by the fear that the
action of the Finance Committee will not
be, sanctioned by the Senaie. or may not
be approved by the House. In either case !
the result will be disastrous.

AND THE DEAD
COME TO LIFE
' r
:â
Startling Recovery of a
Man in a Boston
Hospital.
Had Been Pronounced Lifeless
After the Regular Tests by
Physicians.
Then the Patient Suddenly Revived.
A Falling: Brick Did Not Break
His Skull.
BOSTON, Mass., May 11 A dead man
came to life in the city hospital morgue
to-day. Frank McDermott left his home
at 33 Webber street this morning and went
to work on a new building on Mount
Pleasant avenue. One of the workmen,
three stories above where McDermott was
working, | dropped a brick which struck
him on top of the head. His fellow work
men picked him up as dead, called a police
ambulance and hurried him off to the
city hospital.
Everbody thought McDermott was dead,
and he was carried directly to the Morgue.
A half dozen physicians gathered around
the body to make a perfunctory examina
tion of the corpse, according to the rules
of the institution. They had just pro
nounced him dead, after the regular tests,
when they were astounded to see the
corpse move and assume a sitting posture.
"What's the trouble?" he asked, getting
up from the table and jumping about the
room. An examination by the physi
cians showed that McDermott' s skull had
not been fractured and, other than a
slight scalp wound, he was all right.
After his head had been dressed he went
back to work. It is considered a most re
markaDle case as the patient bad appar
ently been dead several hours.
VICTOR! J Oil THE DISSENTERS.
They Will Be Properly Represented at
the Queen's Jubilee.
LONDON, Ese., May 11.â The dissen
ters â or those denominations apart from
the Church of Englandâ -have won out in
their protest against being excluded from
participation in the religions exercises at
St. Paul's Cathedral, in celebration of
tbe Queen's jubilee.
Tbe Prince of Wales, who is practically
chairman of the combined committee of
arrangements, has caused notification to
be sent to tbe executive committee of the
Congregationaltsts, from which the first
protest emanated, that tbe j dean and
chapter of St. Paul's Cathedral will make
provision for the presence of two repre
sentatives each of the iTesbyterian,
Baptist, Methodist, Congre rational, Uni
tarian and all other religious denomina
tions outside the pale of the established
church.
The selection of these representatives
will be left to the national governing com
mittee of each denomination, or where
no such committees exist, to the modera
tors or other supreme church officials.

UNDER THE NOOSE
The Deputy Constable
Arraigned for Murder
at Newhall.
Strong Evidence Connecting
Him With the Death of
McCoy Pyle.
Network of Proof That He Mur
dered His Brother Officer
and Friend.
LOS ANGELAS, Cal , May 11.â The ex
amination of Deputy Constable Ed Mc-
Camish, charge 1 with the killing of Con
stable Henson McCoy Pyle of Fillmore,
was begun before Justice Clayton at New
hall to-day, and the evidence was uncom
fortably strong against tiie accused. A
number of witnesses testified to facts that
contradicted the story of McCamish of
how he and Pyle had arrested two iramps
for committing burglary in the room of
McCamish, and how the two prisoners
escaped from their captors at Castaic Sta
tion after killing Pyle.
The original story of McCamish might
have passed as the truth but for the fact
that be talked too much and drew suspi
cion upon himself.
Dailison Lineberger, a brother-in-law of
the deceased, testified that he bad en- ]
tered the room of McCamish and found
there the clothing and other articles that
the defendant had claimed were stolen by
the two men who, he said, he and the
other officer encountered at Castaic. I
Lineberg found in the room even the j
identical pair of handcuffs which Mc-
Camish said be had snapped on one of bis j
prisoners and had been carried away by
the culprit. It was the discovery of the
things claimed to have been carried away
that appeared to fasten guilt upon' tbe |
deputy constable.
Sheriff Cbarlebois of Ventura County
also found some of the articles, and he
identified a number that bad been de
scribed to him as among the plunder of i
McCamish's robber. The deputy constable j
had telephoned to Los Angeles a minute j
description of tbe robbers, but to Sheriff ;
Cliarlebois he claimed that he bad been
sandbagged and chloroformed, and had no
idea what the fellows looked like.
Other witnesses said they baa examined i
tbe ground about tbe scene of the shoot- |
ing and couia find no footprints but those
of McCamish and Pyle. There was no
sign of struggle, such as had bsen de
scribed by the defendant, and no indica
tions that any men other than the con
stable and bis deputy had been on tbe
soot that night.
Ali the evidence tended to tighten the !
coils about McCamish. The examination
will be continued to-morrow. The pris
oner is detained in jail here.
It is not likely that an attempt will be
made during the preliminary examina
tion to show that McCamish's crime was ;
prompted by lova for Mrs. Pyle â an af- j
lection which was not returned by that j
estimable woman. The evidence already
taken is sufficient to warrant the holding i
of the accused man, and the story of his :
unrequited love will not be brought out '
until he is placed on trial for bis life.
WORK OF WOODLAND'S GUESTS.
P. W. Lueddeke of Los Angeles Elected
President of the Hermann Sons
Grand Parlor. i
WOODLAND, Cal., May 11â The sec- i
ond day's session of the Grand Lodge of
Hermann Sons opened this morning with
increased attendance, quite a number of
delegates having arrived on last night's !
train.
An engrossed testimonial was ordered

dent John Schum. An acknowledgment '
from the family of the late Grand Secre

Kuhn, Theodore Muegge and Otto Solo
mon, all of Concordia Lodge, were initi
ated into the Grand Lodge as ex-presi- !
dents and members for life.
The work of revising the by-laws and
constitution occupied the attention of the
lodge moat of the forenoon. An amend
ment was proposed which provides for
both life and accident insurance. It was
referred to a special committee with in
structions to report in sixty days. Some
of the other amendments are very im
portant and sweeping in character.
There was quite a contest for the honor
of entertaining the next Grand Lodge be
tween San Francisco, Oakland and Liver
more. The former city won and the next
Grand Lodge will meet on the second
Monday in May, 1893.
The election of officers for the ensuing
year resulted as follows: President, P. W.
Lueddeke of Los Angeles; vice-president,
William Briggs of San Francisco: secre

HOMING PIGEONS FOR JUNEAU.
Carrier Service to Bi Established Between
Port Trwrsznd and the
A Jas ken Ct/.
PORT TOWNSEND. W ash., May 11.-
According to private information received
from the north on the Topeka this city
and Juneau, the thriving metropolis of
Alaska, are soon to be placed in direct
communication through the medium of a
carrier-pigeon service. Superintendent
Duncan of the Alaska Treadwell Gold
Milling Company has procured several '
pairs of pigeons from an Alameda (Cal.)
fancier, and a large loft has been built at
the Treadwell for their accommodation.
As soon as they breed the young birds will
be trained to fly to and from Port Town
send. The distance is 823 miles by steam
er, and is too great for a bird to traverse
in one day.
As a homer makes very slow progress
after the first day a system of stations willy
probably be instituted. Stations will be
established at Juneau or Douglas Island,
Fort Wrangle. : Fort Togas, Nanaimo, B.
C. and Port Townsend.
The institution of the service between
thi> place and Alaska will provide an op
portunity for some enterprising citizen to
construct and maintain here the cute to
whicn the doves will fly. It is niorp than
probable that the wealthy Aiaska Tread
well Company would be willing to pay a
.small salary to insure the safe and prompt
delivery of their messages and to tele
graph such messages as it desires to trans
mit eastward. The work entailed after
the cotes had been built would be very
little.

LIQUOR ORDINANCE
Novel Law to Regulate
the Management of
Saloons.
wives and Mothers Empow-
ered to Blacklist Hus-
bands or Sons.
Drinking Places Must Be Without
Chairs and Window Screens
Are Tp. booed.
POMONA, Cal., May 11.â Probably tbe
most unique law governing the sale of in
toxicants and management of stloons was
passed by the City Council of Pomona to
day, and only awaits publication to be
come a law of this municipality. This
law is the result of a hotly fought cam
paign that ended in the triumph of the
high-license advocates over the friends of
prohibition. For two years Pomona has
been the strictest prohibition tuwn in Cal
ifornia, and now, under the high-license
policy, it will control saloons by the most
drastic law ever enacted in this State for
the regulation of the liquor business. ./ /V>
The new law piov.ides that there shall
be two saloons in Pomona, each to pay
$1000 license annually in advance. Sa
loon-keepers must eive $5000 bonds that
they will not violate any of tbe provisions
of the ordinance unuer which they are
licensed. They arc to hire but one bar
tender each, whose character shall be ap
proved by the City Council. The saloon
keepers must be residents of Pomona, and
their bondsmen must be property-owners
The saloons shall be opened six days in
the week, from 6 a. m. to 10 p. m. They
shall have no frosted or painted windows,
or screens of any description, and there
must be an unobstructed view of the bar
from the street at all times. There can be
no rear doors or rear entrances to the sa
loons. But one seat, chair or bench is al
lowed each place and that must be for the
bartender and bo placed behind the bar.
Barrels must not be used for flitting or
leaning places.
No games of chance or cards will be per
mitted in the saloons.
The saloon-Keeper's license is to be im
mediately revoked and his bondsmen ren
dered liable if liquor is sold to any person
under legal age, or to any female, or to
any citizen to whom the saloon-keener has
been legally warned to sell no intoxicants.
The City Trustees have also provided that
when any woman of legal age who makes
affidavit tbat she is dependent upon her
son, brother or father for support, and
that be is spending money in saloons here,
the man's name shall be posted back of
the bar in each saloon and the license of
the saloon-keeper wbo sells to bim there
after shall be revoked.
Notwithstanding these provisions there
are many men who wish to take out saloon
licenses here and give the bonds required.

Imprisoned on a Charge of Hating
Accepted Bribes.
PORTLAND. Ob., May 11.â "General"*
Edward K'.lfeatber and Charles S. Brat
ton, indicted by the United States Grand
Jury for accepting bribes from I. H.
Taafe, while serving as jurors in the
United States court, for rendering an ex
cessive verdict in a condemnation suit,
wer_ arrested yesterday and released on
heavy bonds.
Taafe, the alleged briber, was brought
from The Dalles in the morning by a
United States Deputy Marshal. He
claims to have been the victim of a con
spiracy on the part of Bratton, whom he
stigmatizes as a blackmailer of the most
dangerous type. Taafe is willing that the
excessive verdict be set aside, and that
United States Judge Bellinger assess the
damage due him for bis lands condemned
in the construction of the Celilo Portage
Railway.
â¢'My arrest is the result of the failure of
one of the most contemptible blackmail
ing schemes ever attempted in the State of
Oregon," said Mr. Taafe. '"This Charles
Bratton, a juror in the trial of the suit of
the Government against myself in the
railway proceedings, was a veritable leech
on me during the trial."

WILL BE -EDUCATED AT HOME
Bright Naval Cadets Will No Longer Be
Sent Abroad.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 11 âThe
Navy Department proposes to abandon
the policy of sending the two lead
ing cadets of each, year's graduating
class at Annapolis to Europe for an ad
vanced course of instruction in naval
architecture. It will after June next edu
cate its young men for the construction
corps entirely at the schools of this coun
try. ; For several years it bas been the
custom to send one or two cadets each
year to the Royal School at Greenwich to
be educated for two years at this Govern
ment's expense and then commission
tbem as assistant naval constructors.
In all instances the American lads have
taken tbe highest honor of their class and
in competition, too, with , men their
seniors by many years. Of about twenty
boys sent from the naval academy to
these foreign schools all are now members
of the construction corps, save rive, who
have died, aud one, Lewis Nixon, who
runs a ship-building plant. Three of the
cadets died from the heavy strain pro
duced by efforts to maintain the records
established by tbe American boys, two
having committed suicide and another
dying soon alter his return. Eight cadets
are now taking the course abroad. Five
of them have already been commissioned
assistant naval constructors. Three will
return in June.
These young men are being educated at
Glasgow and Paris. England some years
ago positively declined to receive further
American cadets at her naval schools and
other advanced institutions of naval arch
itecture were selected. Lately she has re
fused to permit cadets at Glasgow to in
spect her leading shipyard or, receive any
information of a technical nature. Her re
fusal to grant courtesies is said to have
been due to jealousy at the high stand
taken by Americans over her own men,
especially at Greenwich.
Chief Naval Constructor Hichborn has
written a statement showing the same
course can now be secured at either the
Cornell or Boston school* of * technology,
and that it will be more patriotic to send
cadets intended for the construction corps
to one of these institutions than to for
eign schools, where the course is said to
be no better. - - â â¢â

Marshal Creed of Sausalito

Legal Combat the Outcome of the
Girls' Fight Against a Cor
. poration.
LARKSPUR, - Cal, May 11.-The
fight waged ,by the Brown sisters,
Belle | and Mary, against . the American
Land and Trust Company, and C. ,W.
Wright, its, president, in particular, toot
another turn to-day, and the wealthy
land-owner and president of a big corpora
tion had warrants for the arrest of the
young women sworn out in San Rafael.
The scene of destruction presents a
sorry sight to-day. Where the fences of
the corporation stood all that remain are
the stumps of a few posts. Evidently the
Sansalito workmen who made the raid
yesterday were not experts, for the ragged
edges cf the stumps present an ugly ap
pearance. In a tangled heap on the right
hand side of the road, twisted into a con
fused mass of posts and barb wire, lies the
remains of the fence, while a few feet dis
tant stands the house which was moved
clear across the road and out of the way.
All is quiet to-day. Both factions are
placing their reliance in the legal procaed
ings already instituted. President
Wright's bands are, tied, so far as replac
ing the shanty or rebuilding the fence, by
the injunction obtained by, the Brown
girls from Superior Judge F. M. Ange
lotti. *
. This morning President Wright jour
neyed to the county seat and visited the
hall of justice. He claims that an attempt
is being made to steal the land from him,
and this, he says, be will resist. Here at
Larkspur every one sides with the Browns
and a row almost occurred to-day because
an employe of the land company stood up
for Wright. This was Tim Murphy, who
looked down the barrel of Marshal Creed's
revolver yesterday. After yesterday's ex
perience Murphy had enough, and today
he has even quit having an opinion.
However, lie thought it well to swear out
a warrant to-day before Justice Gardner
of San Rafael charging John E. Creed of
Sausalito with assault to murder witu a
deadly weapon. He also swore out one
against Mary Brown for the same offense.
C. W. Wright was not so generous in
his actions. He went before Justice
Gardner and got warrants out for the ar
rest of Mary Brown, Belle Brown and lit
tle Peter Keegan, charging them ail with
assault with a deadly weapon, for be it re
membered the clothes of Mr. Wright were
torn from his back by the athletic girls
who are fighting for what they claim are
their rights. His watch is broken, and
the humiliation and the shock to bis dig
nity are to be considered also. â¢
The arrests will be made to-morrow,
when the trio will ba brought before the
justice. Some sensational stories are
promised and more details of the battle
which took place in the wooded canyon
near Larkspur will be related.
'1 To-night both parties are awaiting the
morrow's legal conflict.
ARIZONA'S BANDIT CHASE.
Bloodhounds Close Upon the Trail of
Parker, the Escaped Prescott
Con n.c I.
PRESCOTT, Ariz., May 11.â Advices
received from the posse after the crimi
nals wbo escaped on Sunday from the
Prescott jail, killing Lee Norris in their
flight, are that the fugitives have sepa
rated. The Mexican, Cornelia, is believed
to have started for the Santa Maria mines
in Western Arizona, where he has friends.
Miller, who was wounded, is undoubtedly
in hiding in the Bradshaw Mountains.
Paiker,' the Atlantic and Pacific train
robber and the man who shot Norris, has
a reward of over $-5000 on his head, and is
being pursued vigorously. â 'â '. ,"l'-i
Fully fifty of the most experienced men
in Arizona are on bis ' trail. After the
fight with the two Deputy Sheriffs in the
Bradshaws, Parker rode off to the east
ward, crossing the Black Canyon road in
the p direction of Bloody , Basin, in the
Verde Valley, and of Tonto Basin.'*'; If he
tries to hide himself in the fastnesses of
Bloody Basin he will undoubtedly soon
be captured, 1 for two "bloodhounds, the
property of J. D. Moore of this city, are
with the trailer! and appear to have no
difficulty in keeping the scent.
Cowboys are joining in the search and
several posses are watching the passes
into Tonto Basin. The officers are confi
dent that Parker -will ; be taken within
two days, though probably as a corpse.
There is no doubt that be will make a
fight to the death. ./--/, t

Penurious William White Dies
Without Revealing His
Secret.
"1 Don't Care Who Gats the Money
When I'm Gone," His Death
bed Declaration.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 11. -William
White, an old Englishman, died yester
day at his home on Lower Sacramento
road, rive miles from this city. He was
possessed of about $7000, which he had
buried on his place, and now a diligent
search for the coin is being made.
Three years ago White took the money
out of one of the local banks. About a
year after that, while H. M. Rhodes was
at work in a pig pen on the place, he came
across a bundle of money as large as a
man's head. Rhodes gave it to White
and nothing further was heard of it until
several months ago, when Rhodes found
it again in an old ash barrel, and again
returned it.
On Sunday Rhodes went to White, who
was dying, and asked him to tell where
the money was.
"If you die and people know you had
it, they might say I robbed you, and i
want to turn it over to. the proper author
ities in case of your death," said Rhodes.
"Never mind the money," answered
White. "It is hid on the place, and I
don't care who gets it when I'm gone.
All I want is enough money in my pockets
to pay for a good funeral."
Further efforts to get the old man to
divulge the secret were unavailing.
STOCKTON' HUTEL FAILURE.

SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY CROPS.
Grain Fields Suffer From the Continued j
Hot Weather and the Warm
North Winds.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 11. â The
farmers are beginning 10 grow anxious
over the crop outlook. A montb ago the
fields gave much promise, but tbey are
now beginning to suffer from the drouth.
A north wind prevailed to-day and had a
very bad effect upon grain, and if it
should continue without rain the yield
will be smaller than now estimated. The
now prevalent opinion is that the grain
crop this year will be poor, and some
think that it wiil not amount to 70 per
cent ot an average yield. The season has
advanced so for tbat rain would do only %
limited amount of good now. It would
benefit late *Â«own grain, but injure the
early sown crops by causing them to
lot Re.
Some dealers believe that there will be a
very fair crop notwithstanding the drouth,
snd that there will be a heavy output
from this State during the coming season.
Bruce Harrison, president of the
Farmers' Union and Milling Company,
who bas just returned from a trip up in
Butte County, says that in that section
of the State not more than two-thirds of a
crop will be harvested. In fact, in some
instances the prospective crop there is so
poor that it will not be harvested at all.
THE BIG GUN PRACTICE.
Oar Smooth Bores Can Be De

Hundred Yards.
Five Out of Eight Shots in One Day
Struck the Spac3 That a Battle
. Ship Would Occupy at Sea-
The testing of the big smooth-bore guns
at the Presidio fortifications last week
gave considerable experience in heavy ar
tillery practice, and the results as a whole
were very satisfactory from a military
point of view, if they were not to the mind
of some . individual who, not knowing
much about military matters and artillery
in particular, wrote for a newspaper that
"the shooting was very wild."
The fact is tbat on tbe second day an im
aginary, vessel the size (fa battle-ship was
located on the platted crater at a distance
ul 2500 yards, and five out of eight shots
struck the space tbe vessel would have
occupied, a remarkable achievement with
smooth bores.
Yesterday there was- commenced the
practice witn tbe big rifled guns. Tbis will be

practice* with mortars. * No one will be per
mitted, to visit tne fortifications "except for
military reasons."

Company, Ceylon, is at the Occidental.
He has come here in the interest of the
tea-growers of Ceylon, who, as he ex

import tax on teas to create a fund for the
expense of introducing Ceylon teas
throughout the world. They have fouud
it worked well, for tbey have been able to

LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 11.â The
members of the Order of Railway Con
ductors and their relatives and friends are
now in full possession of the city, and
they are having an enjoyable time.
Nearly 3000 visitors have already arrived
and nearly 1000 more will come to-morrow
on two belated trains, one from the Penn
sylvania road and one from the New York
Central. Ths former is detained near El
! Paso by a washout and the latter will
! come in from the north to-morrow. One
I train in two sections brought 600 from
l Chicago this afternoon, and the rush at
i headquarters, bas been exciting all day.
j The local committees, whose duty it is to
j look out for the guests, have done their
: work well in receiving the crowds that
j have come to attend the international
I convention.
The local division headquarters in the
Nadeau Hotel, the National headquarters
1 at the Westminster and the headquarters
l of the ladies' auxiliary in the Van Nuys
! Hotel have been thronged all day by
j strangers registering, donning tbe many
j large and brilliant badges and swapping
I visiting cards. Nothing is too good for
: them and they do not lack entertainment.
The first business session of the conven
tion was held behind closed doors in
Music Hall this afternoon. Nearly all of
the delegates: answered to the, rollcall.
Grand Chief Conductor E. E. Clark pre
sided and Secretary Martin Clancy was at
the desk. The first business of the meet
ing was tbe appointment of committees.
Tbat on credentials bad little difficulty in
reporting on the right of delegates to their
seats, there being only one contest and
that not persisted in.
The report of the grand chief conductor
was presented but not read. The head of
the order made a ruber of recommenda
tions for future government, and congratu
lated the organization on its growth.
The grand secretary and treasurer, Mar
tin Clancy, presented a report that dealt
with the financial conditions, and was full
of interesting statistics. It showed that
in 1895 1337,000 was paid out of the insur
ance fund on 161 policies. . In 1896 there
was paid out $339,000 on 159 policies.
Most of tbis went to the widows and chil
dren of deceased conductors. Several
thousand dollars of it was paid on acci
dent policies. The membership of the or
der now numbers about '.1,000. The
finances are in good condition, and the
order bas cause for congratulation for tbe
manner in which tbey have been con
ducted. - ''.J. 7
William Durbin, chairman of the insur
ance committee,. made a report in which
be discussed the present laws of the order
governing the insurance department and
recommended some changes.
The meeting of the local ladle* auxil
iary was held this afternoon in Turn Ve
rein Hall, where a welcome was extended
to the grand officers, the delegates and the
visiting members of the auxiliary. 'â â¢â  The '
first session of the Grand Division of the
Ladies' Auxiliary of the Order of Railway
Conductors was then called to order. The
j hall was beautifully decorated with smi
| lax. roses and carnations.
:'. There are in America 103 auxiliary divi
! sions, and each has a delegate. Although
' they are not all here, it is expected that
i nearly every division will be represented.

While the majority of tne visitors . will
pass the next few days in having a good
lime, 379 delegates will attend closely to
business, holding _ two or three l session*
daily. Theirs being a secret organization,
every effort is made to withhold details of
what happens ;in the meetings. It does
not now appear that there is any friction
over the business affairs, but there is to
be, according to present indications, a
lively contest over the election of officers
on Saturday. _ ; - :\:
To-day's programme ended . with a con
cert at Hazard's Pavilion, followed by a
public reception, with i. a variety :of ad
dresses of welcome and replies thereto.
To-morrow the visitors will be entertained
with a Wild.West snow at Fiesta Park.
CHINESE CHECKED.
Secretary of the Treasury Gage Excludes
All but Twenty-One of Two Hundred
and Fifty-Six Applicants.
The 261 Chinese who arrived here by the
China last Monday on the way to the
Nashville Exposition have been checked
in their departure for the Sunny South
until the Secretary of the Treasury shall
have been heard from.
It appears that the Secretary was in
formed some time ago that only 200 Chi
nese would be needed under the contracts
made for the Chinese portion of the ex
position, with that understanding 179
Chinese laborers were admitted into the
United States by way of North Dakota,
leaving only 21 more persons entitled to
land. It is now stated that these 179 were
laborers employed in digging and build
ing tbe foundations for the ' Chinese part
of the show, and that the 261 now here are
artists, actors, acrobats and musicians.
It is believed that the Secretary of the
Treasury is marveling greatly over the
number of laborers required to build a
small foundation, and that this is why he
has intimated that perhaps twenty-one
additional Chinese would be enough for
the purposes of the exposition.
In the meantime the 261, four of
whom are women, are in the custody of
the Federal officer?. lA *â "<â¢ â r.r.s^Vv.^

NOTES FOR THE
NATIONAL GUARD
The Problem of Transporta
tion Cuts a Figure in
Encampments.
National Guardsman Wants
Some Information About
Promised Reforms.
Good Showing at the Inspection of the
Fifth Infantry, Sicond Brigade.
The Cadets Drill.
From one end of the State to the other
at this time ibe talk of the men of the
National Guard is camp. Every company
is going to camp, but the great trouble is
as to what kind of camps are there to be.
If there are to be only regimental camps,
then the appropriation for that purpose
I will be ample, but if there are to be
; brigade camps, as is proposed by the First
1 and Thud brigades, then the transporta
tion required for these will take up all the
funds, and tbe others will bave only the
allowance that will be sufficient for sub
sistence, and the individual members of
the companies will have to go down deep
into their pockets to obtain the money for
transportation.
For instance, the officers of the Third
Brigade want a brigade encampment, and
they want to go to Santa Cruz. That
means the assemblage of companies at that
point from Chico, Colusa, Nevada City, Marys
viile, Sacramento, Woodland, Redding, Stock-
ton, Fresno, Modesto, Visalia, Bakersfleld and
Merced, and it has been estimated by those
posted in such matters that after setting aside
the sum allowed by law to each comp&uy for
camp purposes the remainder would not be
sufficient to meet the transportation ex
per -â â .<* for that one brigade, to say nothing of
the expenses of transportation that would be
required for the companies of the other bri
gades.
This state of affairs shows that there is a lack
of system in the management of tbe guard in
this State. It Is left to tbe officers in the vari
ous brigade limits to determine what kind of
a camp there should be, and that leads to a
great veal of dissatisfaction, because there is
always a lack of unanimity as to the division
of the money appropriated for camp * pur
poses. The law says that "the commander-in
chief may annually order an encampment for
discipline and drill, either by division, bri
gade, regiment, battalion or unattached com
pany." If the commander-in-chief took the
matter in his own hands, held a . consultation
with the adjutant-general, considered the
amount of money available, the cost of trans
portation, and made himself familiar through
reports as to available sites for camps, be
couid then, after a careful survey of the situ
ation, order such an encampment or encamp
ments as the law says he may, thereby avoid
ing a.l the friction that is likely to arise be
fore the money now on band or available is
allotted. . , -
A National Guardsman has written a letter
oi Inquiry In which he asks, "What has be
come of the proposed reforms that tbe di
vision commander announced be would bring
about when he took office? We of tne guard
have been looking for them, and we are still
looking, but as we ark patient we can afford to
wait."

evening by Division Inspector Lieutenant-
Colonel Sumner. The Naval Reserve will be
Inspected some time In June. --";:â¦:
The Second Brigade.
The inspection of the companies in this City
are being held this week.
During the past wees there was an informal
meeting of Brigadier-General Warfleld and
Colonel Fairbanks of the Fifth Infantry and
Colonel Smith of the First Infantry on the
subject of camp, . but no conclusion 'was
reached, as no announcement as to funds to
be allowed each regiment has yet; been an
nounced. ;." â ;â  '.J'J 'J^JJj^JJj]., ;
The First Regiment is considering sites all
the way from Ukiah to Santa â  Monica. Santa
Cruz has offered the old camp ground north
of the bathing-houses near the beach, but that
is not | considered as desirable a place as the
one on which the far-lameed Tripe Hilt looms
up above the surrounding territory. There is
some tall: of a site at Santa Rosa, one at UkUh
and mere are others that may loom up in the
approaching future. -

the drill there will be a dance, and as the
members of the corps, who are all pupils of

The inspections of the companies of the Filth
were held last week, and from partial reports
received it appears that a good showing was
made. A Company had 63 men out of 70 at
rollcall. B had 68 out of 71, F had 81) out oi 90
and G had 67 out of 70. Captain Carrlngton,
U. S. A., was present at the inspections. 'â ' â 
Companies A and F and the band of I the
Fifth have secured as a new armory in Oak
land the large, commodious rooms that were
formerly occupied by the Acme Club. There
is a large drill-room, rooms lor each company,
a room for the band and rooms lor headquar
ters."* In addition there are the ' bathrooms
that were built for the club. The new armory
is one of the finest of auy in the State at this
time. The members of the two companies are
very much pleased with the change. A feature

in Secret Session â Idols of the
Faculty May Be Shattered.
The regents of tne university in secret
session yester day afternoon elected as
secretary of the board E. W. Davis of
Santa Kosa. There were twenty-six ap
plicants for the position. The candidates
that developed considerable strength were
Professor E. J. Wickson, Dr. W. C. Bart
lett, John Bonner, Joseph Leggett and
Mr. Davis. On tbe sixth ballot tne Santa
Kosa farmer and schoolteacher received a
majority of all the ballots cast, and his
choice was subsequently made unani
mous.
The regents attending the session were:
Governor Budd, Miller, Martin, Hough
ton, Kellogg, Roweil, Jeter, Slack, Phelps,
Ealiidie, Denicke, Crocser, Coombs, Wal
lace, B ack, John .E. Budd, Heliman,
Koigers, Foote and Chase. The only ab
sentees were Regents Reinstein, Waymire
and Marye, who are beyond tbe limits of
the fc-tate.
The newly elected secretary, successor
of toe late Key. Dr. Bonte, is Superiu
tendentof Schools, Sonoma County, and
grand lecturer ot the Stale Grange. His
friends assert that be was elected because
be is a pracicil farmer, a graduate of the
university, a schoolteacher of experience
. and a successJul man of affair*. Next to
Davis Professor Wickson developed- the
greatest strength.
Tne executive session did not end with
the election of secretary. Several regents
desired to take up the Boni.eil-Fla-g con
troversy, and 'so it was deemed best to
prolong the exclusion of newspaper men
and spectators. The proposition before
the board was to remove Profes--or Flagg.
Governor Budd and Judgo Wallace de
sired a vote on the question, as the case
bad been banging fire long enough.
J. West Martin and others wanted the j
matter referred to a committee. In the |
language of one member of the board J.
West Martin advanced the "monstrous
doctrine" that the professors constituting
the faculty should decide upon tbe re
moval and appointment of instructors.
The assertion tbis doctrine caused sur
prise. Speakers wanted to know what the
regents were appointed for if they should
not perform tbe duty of selecting instruc
tors.
Governor Budd was deciedly in favor of
going down the line and lopping off the
deal t;mD in the faculty. He held it to be
the duty of the regents to remove unworthy
and inefficient profrsjors. The people of
the State expected the Board of Regents
to act without unnecessary delay. Time
and again the regents had been charged
with pursuing a snail-like pace.
Jud Wallace spoke against further de
lay. He believed that all the facts con
cern. n_ the affairs of Bonnell and Flagg
were ceiore the regents and that refer
ence of the subject to a committee would
not throw any more light on the case. Tne
record was belore the regents, and Flagg's
own letters constituted a part of the re
cord. He insisted on immediate action.
J. West Mar. in ndvisea delay. He hoped
the regents would not attempt to decide
questions which the members of the fac
ulty themse.ves should determine.
Other regents participated in the discus
sion. It was broadly intimated that the
time for abolishing idolatry at the uni
versity bad arrived. A few professors had
been tet up as idols and others were ex
pected to fall down and worship them.
lien the discussion became so animated
that Judge Wallace could be heard in the
west conservatory of the institute and the
Governor's voice recognized on California
street, Arthur Rodgers arose an poured
oil on the troubled debate. He soothed
the secret session with gentle pleadings
for peace, and so persuasive was his elo
quence that the regents consented to make
the subject a special order for June 15.
Nothing was settled and no reference was
ide to a committee. When the middle
day of June arrives Bonnell and bis
friends and Fiagg and his followers will
assemble at the institute on the hilltop.
Bonnell will then tell the story again of
Fiagg's unkindness and ingratitude, and
Flagg will tell of Bonnell's domineering
qispos'tion. â  * â

sion the rezents began to consider the re

Before the reading was concluded the
Gavernor suggested that consideration of
the document should be deferred until
this morning's session. This suggestion
was brought about by the general obser
vation that a number of new places bad
been created. The motion to defer pre
vailed.
A slight sensation was caused when a
statement of the bills audited by the
finance committee was read. One item
evoked comment. It was this: .
"Louis Sloss, treasurer, to Julius Kahn,
JUST A GLIMPSE AT THE SLOWLY PROGRESSING FAIR CASE.
legal services administration department,
$1250."
John E. Budd wanted to know what
legal service was performed by Mr. Kahn
and in ttie murmur of voices the word
"Sacramento" was audible. Lieutenant-
Governor Jeter, turning to Speaker
Coombs, said in playful alluson. "Coombs
must have received it â I didn't."
Thk Call reporter asked Governor
Bu id what service had been rendered for
tbe $1250 allowed, and the. latter said be
Knew nothing about the item and would
not vote for it. The Governor left the
room before a vote was taken on the bills.
Regent Timothy Guy Phelps did not
know what legal service had been ren
dered. He knew that Major Mhoon was
the attorney of the board.
John E. Budd moved that the word
"iecal" be stricken out of the report
When the clerk finished reading the
statement of bills audited the roll was
called and the record shows that the bills
were ordered paid. Speaker Coombs, and
perhaps others, understood that the vote
was on John E. Budd's motion to amend.
The bills allowed aggregated $8165 25.
The Kahn item of $1250 may be taken
up at the session tbis morning. It was
acknowledged at Sacramento that the
main work of securing the increa-ed ap
propriation was prepared by Senator
Stratton, Assemblyman Wright and Re
sents Rodgers and . Slack. If it should
turn out that the regents had under any
guise whatever allowed money for lobby
ing at Sacramento, a storm of public in
dignation would surely be aroused.
The contractors for the worK of building
the Affiliated Colleges submitted a com
munication to the board setting forth that
they hud been* impeded in the work and
put" to much additional expense by reason
of the board's dilatory, tactics in consider
ing progress estimates. They presented
estimate No. 3 for $3780, No. 2 for $7680
and No. 3 for $5670. -.*.*
The contractors claim that they have
expended $36,140 to date and have only
received $9002." The contracting firm is
the Ray Construction Company. Governor
Budd promised to approve tbe bills at
Sacramento to-morrow and present them
at oncj to the Board of Examiner..
Henry Lund, Swedisb Consul, and Dr.
Thomas Boysen presented a petition
bearing 5000 signatures requesting that a
chair be established at the university for
the teaching of the 10-t language of the
Noraeland. Mr. Lund stated that 100,000
direct descendants of the Norsemen dwelt
on the Pacific Coast, and thai there were
a million indirect descendants. The sub
ject was referred to tne committee on in
ternal administration.' '* .-. -'ii.'- ..'-.'
DR. BARROWS' RECEPTION.
Ladies of the Occidental Board - and
the Fresbyieriau Union Do Their
Great Lecturer Honor. :."
A reception was given to Dr. Barrows
yesterday at the Presbyterian Mission
Home by the ladies of the Occidental
Board and the Presbyterian Ministerial
Union.
The rooms were well filled with people
who were eager to bear what Dr. Barrows
had to say about the far East. He was in
troduced by the Rev. Dr. McKenzie. In
speaking of the women of the Eastern
countries, he said: "If any one says
that women are honored outside of Chris
tian countries, they do not speak the truth.
The work of Christian lectureship which I
bad the honor of founding in India, is
doing good work. On every hand the
name American is loved. I have seen the
work of Christians where, from India
to Hawaii, and my estimate of the work
has not been at all diminished. On' tne
whole, the missionary outlook in India is
encouraging."
Barbers' Association. -
At a special meeting oi the Barbers' Associa
tion, Charles Pfeffer presiding, it was* decided
that hereafter members will be* furnished em
ployment free of charge. An entrance fee, how
ever, will be charged. A cmmlttee was
appointed to induce proprietors to close their
shops at 8 o'clock on : the evenings of week
days and at noon on Sundays.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 12, 1897.
FAIR'S SIGNATURE
NOW THE THEME
Litigation Over Mrs. Cra
ven's Deeds at Last
Takes a New Turn.
Experts Hired to Dispute the
Handwriting Coming to
the Front.
For the Time Being No More Will
Be Heard of Blanks and Print
shop Legends.
The attorneys for the Fair estate moved
around a new corner yesterday and, in
consequence, there was a general awaken
ing in Judge Slack's courtroom in antici
pation of the long-awaited disclosures.
At last thai bland discussion of blanks
is at a temporary end. For a time, any
how, nothing more will be beard about
the humdrum of a printshop, of t..e
pranks of composing-room devils or of the
eccentricities of a job-office press. Hand
writing is the theme now, and even that
promises to be but the novelty of a day.
Truly, there seems but little prospect of
anything really stirring until the defense
is given its chance to return the assault
and tender its proof intended to demon
strate that, after all that bas been said, tbe
deeds held by Mrs. Nettie Craven, and
claimed to have been given to ber by tbe
late Senator Fair, are genuine.
The change of base took place during
the afternoon session, and it was indeed a
relief, for tbe morning bad crept away,
like many another session that bad pre
ceded it, in a dull and listless inquiry as
to the minutiae of Crocker's printing es
tablishment. Men who are wise, or al
leged to be wise, in the lore of upstrokes,
dotting of "i's," crossing of "t's" and the
peculiarities in general of millionaires'
chirography, come now to the front and
with tbem their magnifying glasses,
blackboards and sticks of chalk.
Those who appear first are the hired
experts of those who seek to prove the
signatures of Fair to Mrs. Craven's deeds
and to the notary's acknowledgments to
be forgeries. And then there will be
others. They will demonstrate by equally
scientific methods that Fair signed those
documents, each and every one of them.
So there it is.
Foreman Keefe of the Crocker compa
ny's printing-room was once more found
on the witness-stand when the trial was
resumed yesterday morning. Keefe took
occasion to explain to tbe court and jury
why it was that bis office accounts had
the appearance of having been kept in a
haphazard manner.
. As a matter of fact these records, accord
ing to Keefe, were not considered im
portant enough to require any great de
gree of exactitude. All they were kept for
was to serve as "tracers" in case of dis
pute between the printing department and
any other branch of the Crocker establish
ment.
No one in particular was required to
keep these accounts. They constituted a
sort of family affair among the printers,
and ware intended more as a record of
protection than for any other purpose.
Tuen, as to tbe erasures appearing in
the records, he explained that it fre
quently happened that the presses would
be stopped on "home" work in order, to
accommodate some "outside" job, and
the change would always necessitate a
correction of the records.
, : Dan Murphy, the boy who "for want of
something else to do," as Keefe said at
Monday's session, mutilated the printing
room records, < was now recalled to the
witness-stand to be questioned regarding
his knowledge of tbat troublesome copy
of a proof of a notarial blank, which the
attorneys for the estate have been trying
to get into the evidence for a fortnight.
Of course there was the usual objection,
then an argument, and finally the ruling
out again of the copy as being inadmis
sible. '
Mr. McEnerney for the plaintiffs then re
sorted to a new trick. Abandoning bis
effort to have Murphy divulge the con
tents ot the copy to the jury, he asked the
witness ,to describe ; the "appearance" of
the copy. Objection and argumentâ that
was natural, for this was only an attempt
to beat the devil around the stump. But
this time tbe court ruled that the question
could be answered, provided' the witness
did not attempt in describing the appear
ance of the document to give its tents.
Triumphant smiles wreathed the coun
tenances oi i counsel j lor â¢ ti.e plaintiff, for
they confide ed that they bad won a great
point, but this immediately gave â¢ way to
an expression of chagrin when Murphy
answered the question over which there
bad been so , much debate * Murphy said
be couldn't to -ave his life describe . the
copyâ in .'art, he was not Â»urÂ«; that he had
ever seen itâ and a roar Â« f latiÂ«nt?r,went
up at the expense of Mr/, McEnerney and
bis associates. Even Judge Slack's placid
countenance relaxed.,, ; 'â¢....
--p Fornian J. Gilmartin , of .'; Crocker's press
room succeeded Murphy and briefly told
what he and his department had to no
with . printing legal bants. Then the
lunch hour recess was taken.
H. R. Davidson, assistant accountant of
tbe Bank of British Columbia, was called
at the afternoon session, and there was a
moving about in the line of plaintiff's at
torneys.Mr. McEnerney forsook the lead
ing counsel's chair, surrendering to Robert'
B. Mitchell, his associate. The make-up
of the defense's front did not change, how
ever, Mr. Deimas retaining his old place.
There was a clinch the moment the first
question, after tbat regarding the witness'
name and occupation, was asked. T is
was, "Did you know the signature of the
late James' G. Fair in his lifetime?"
â  Mr. Mitchell had in * his hand a check
drawn by Fair on the Bank of British Co
lumbia and in favor of Dr. Marc Leving
ingston for $50, and intended to show it to
the witness.
Mr. Deimas wanted to know something
about tbe knowledge of the witness in ref
erence to the deceased millionaire's hand
writing, and ' also inquired as vto the pur
pose of this evidence.
Mr, Mitchell replied tbat Davidson could
erolain regarding his familiarity *â¢* with
Fair's handwriting. As to the purpose of
the evidence, counsel said it would, as the
genuine signature of James G. Fair, be
compared with the disputed signatures ap
pearing upon certain exhibits already in
troduced in evidenceâ including presuma
bly the Craven deed-*, the pencil will and
Fair's letter to Mrs. Craven,' in which he
said it was his desire to be revenged upon
the men who bad "dogged him into sign
ing those other papers."
Mr. Deimas contended that the plain
tiffs, under the law, had no right to at
tack a duly acknowledged deed until they
bad first overthrown the acknowledgment.
The latter, he said, had not been achieved
in this case, despite tbe promise that it
would be. and he was confident the attor
neys on the other side were a thousand
miles from doing it. pPgpP^B^lJp^p^BÃ
Mr. Mitchell insisted that he only de
sired to introduce the check as a basis for
future general comparison, and the court
finally ruled that it would be temporarily
admitted, but subject to rejection later on
in the trial.
The check was then banded to David
son, and that gentleman â  readily recog
nized the signature thereon as being that
of Fair. Then a dozen more checks were
submitted to him and' he pronounced
them all genuine.
James Moore, assistant accountant of
the Nevada Bank, was next called and
tdentified a number of checks drawn by
ihe dead millionaire on tbat bank.
â  Charles S. Neal, wno was Fair's secre
tary in his lifetime, tost ; tied that he rec
ognized the handwriting of the Senator in
a number of letters shown him. most of
which were addressed to Angus & Bresse.
The ex-secretary was still identifying
letters when an adjournment was taken
until this morning.
MONEY FOR INFLUENCE.
Mm. Mary W- Healey Parts
With All ; H:r Hard-
Earned Savings.
â¢Samuel J. de Graaf Promised to Gt
Her Sick Husband Made a
Policeman.
The preliminary examination of Samuel
J. de Graaf on the charge of grand larceny
was commenced before Judge ' Campbell
yesterday afternoon. --â ?.'
The complaining witness is * Mrs. Mary
W. Healey, 47 Stanley place, and 'she al
leges that De Graaf got $448 from her in
November last on his promise to get her
husband a position on the police force,
which he had failed to fulfill.
ln giving her evidence Mrs. Healer told
a story that aroused- the liveliest interest
in the Judge and spectators. She said
her husband bad ' been sick for tbe past
four years and she had to work to support
the family. I
While working in tbe King-Morse can
ning factory on - Broadway and Sansome
last October sne made the acquaintance of
De Graaf, who was also working there and
was known as "Loney." De Graaf told
her that bis father was a millionaire 'in
Europe and bad several shares in the
factory. He was working there simply as
a spy, as a lot of articles had bean stolen
from the factory.
De Graaf. used to call at her house, and
finally be suggested that as be knew sev
eral officials in the City Hall and bad con
siderable influence be might get her hus
band on the police force.
De Grief told ber after several talks on
the subject tbat it would require money
to give to people who could influence the
Police Commissioners, and she went with
him to the Hibernia Bank and 'drew out
the money, which was all she possessed in
the world, and gave it to De Graaf. Then
they went to the office of Attorney J. J.
Coffey, and De Graaf gave her a note for
the amount. - . *..â¢ ; â ':,
De Graaf afterward went with her hus
band and got an application for a posi
tion on the force, which was filled up, and
she got twelve property-owners to sign it.
Since: then neither she nor ber husband
had heard anything more of tne appoint
ment. - t _ > .p.âi
.Mrs. Healey was subjected to a rigid
cross-examination by Attorney Dare, who
appeared for the defendant: She admitted
that she believed her husband could get
a position on the force although he was a
sick man, and also that it was in the belief
that De Oraaf was a millionaire's son and
had influence 'in the City Hall that she
gave him the money. 1
Hsr cross-examination was not con
cluded when the court adjourned, and it
will be continued to-morrow afternoon.' .

lies and Beaux Spiel for the Big
Show With SplenJ id
Results.
To the merry clink of gold society at
tuned its voice last evening and all was
gayety and jollity serene at the old
Clark-Crocker house, at the corner of Sut
ter and Octavia street*. Stately matrons,
handsome belles and demure and dainty
buds were playing at keeping store, and
what made the game so exceedingly in
teresting was that it was played in the
cause of charity, under the most alluring
of names, "A gingerbread fete."
The ladies who organized this festival
for the benefit of the Children's Hospital
claim that they followed as models simi
lar fetes held yearly in Paris.
Visitors at the fete last evening affirm,
however, that this fete can give those of
the gay and giddy capital many valuable
pointers. At 7:30 p. M., when the doors
were thrown open for the waiting throng,
the neighborhood looked like the village
green at the annual visit of a great three
ring circus. Small boys, big boys and
boys with gray beard or bristling mus
taches hung round the long low. fence
that surrounds the lawn and searched in
vain for a tiny peephole in the glistening
white canvas, electric-topped tent. ,
Within all was life and bustle. Visitors
came early with the modest intention of
remaining late, or at all events until their
well-lined pockets held only a lonely
nickel â car fare. Never before has even
the aacred cause of charity been able to
congregate such an army of pretty girls â
all with a business instinct.
Miss Julia Crocker, Miss' Jennie Blair
and Miss Margarette Sinclair, one ot Oak
land's .fairest belles, achieved distinction
;as spielers. No one escaped their wiles,
jno one wanted to. Miss Crocker, with her
| cheeks as rosy as the Ameiican Beauty
â¢ that adorned the shoulder of her pale
green bodice, won more shekels than all
: the other girls put together; -Miss Blair
worked under the skillful supervision of
Louis Sloss, and made everybody pur
chase enough fancy work to supply their
respective friends with Christmas pres
ents for tbe next dozen years to come. '
The tableaux proved such a success that
a" continuous performance was found
necessary to satisfy the immense throng
: of pleasure-seekers.
Out on the lawns the tattooed man, the
Circassian la iy, the snake-charmer, the
bearded lady, the giantess and a whole
army of freaks amused the multitude.
Unfortunately there was no music. For
some unaccountable reason the ladies
were disappointed at the last moment,
but the ladies promise that the band will
play both this afternoon and evening.
The programme for to-day is especially
rich in novelties. This afternoon Ferris
Hartman and little Arthur Snyder, the
singer, will do their best to amuse the
visitors, end this evening Henry Payot
will deliver his lecture, "Glimpses of the
Mediterranean." On Friday afternoon
Edna Wallace Hopper will be the chief
afternoon attraction.
RETURNED THE RING.
Rufus Van.ar Presents Maude Duggan
With a Diamond and Saves
Himself.
Miss Maude Duggan held quite a levee
in Police Judge Low's court yesterday
morning. She is the pretty and young
woman who claims to be the daughter of
a grain king in Chicago, but who has been
away from home a year or more taking in
the sights of San Francisco, contrary to
repeated telegraphic messages to "come
home."
Last Tuesday she caused a warrant to
be issued for the arrest of Rufus Vassar, a
boy in his teens, who claims to be related
to the Vassars of tbe college of that name.
Sne swore that the young man, who re
sides at the Baldwin Hotel, within a
stone's throw of the Ramona, where she
lodges, took her to church; on one occa
sion, during which visit her pocket was
picked of $112. He took her to the races
after that, and, for fear her pockets might
auain be entered by thieves, she listened
to his seductive voice and allowed him to
be the custodian of her wealth. He wa
gered for her, and presumably lost, as she
declares he made no returns. The final
straw was wben he took a diamond ring of
hers, valued at $200, to have it reset.
Wien he failed to produce the jewel after
a month's time, she caused his arrest for
embezzlement. --ip^^^gj^a^diJwMg
The case was to have been heard yester
day morning, when the young lady and
her court of pretty young boys were
ushered into the presence of Judge Low,
* Vassar, the â¢ defendant, was - there also,
and so was the ring. The prosecution
showed no desire to push the case and it
was allowed to go over for two weeks, the
diamond being returned to Miss Duggan
in the meantime. .'.
' It is understood '. that the two weeks',
continuance is granted to give young Vas
sar ample time to procure $112 from his
people in tbe East to reimburse Miss
Duggan for the loss of her money in the
church. . JJ~ :":â ?! *""' J'JJ "

DR. FRENCH TELLS WHY.
His Reasons for Leaving the
Congregational Ministers'
Club.
' Â»
A Feeble Protest Agiinst the Tacit
Indorsement of the Rev.
Wain m Raier.
The resignation of Dr. H. C. French
from the Congregational Club as a pro
test against its action in electing Rev.
Mr. Rader president has caused a pro
found stir in denominational circles. The
doctor emphatically declare-* that he has
no personal feeling against the clergyman.*
"My resignation," said Dr. French yes-"
terday, "was a painful and humiliating
duty in which conscience and loyalty to
God's word compelled me * to sacrifice io
Christian principle many warm and long- J
treasured personal relations. I tendered
it as a feeble protest against the club's
action in tacitly indorsing, by exalting to j
the highest office in its gift, one who has
recently obtained notoriety , by holding I
the Bible up to public contempt and ridi
cule, both from the pulpit and through
the columns of tbe secular press, using
against the canons of sacred Scripture the
hoary arguments if not the identical
phraseology of notorious infidels.
"A -.'. nineteenth century rationalistic,
priest of Baal has openly* challenged the
credibility of God's word, and his denom
inational brethren have replied by pub
licly crowning the skeptic king.
"I am not a prophet nor the son of a
prophet, bat dare to predict that this ac
tion on the part of representat ye Congre
gational clergymen will be infinitely more
injurious to trie spiritual interests of their
church than were the recent abominations
of the Brown trial. The 'magna charta*
of their corporate and divine authority as
ministers of God has. been assailed and
challenged in the face of a sneering and
infidel world, and no voice of public and
authoritative protest has been heard from
their ranks or their recognized denomina
tional journal. *
"Again, let me dare to prophesy that if
the * professed theologians - and accredited
ministers of the church persist in treating
as a merely amusing _ personal idiosyn
crasy â  and a good 'practical joke 'this
trilling by one ot their number with the
sacied word, then the days of the spiritual
power and influence of the Congregational
church .of . the Pacific . Coast â¢ are â â  num
bered." â â â - L1 __________________. -W-J'ip

A bill has been introduced into Congress
providing for the appointment of a tariff
commission to consist of seven persons to
serve for twenty-one years with salaries of
$7500 each, whose business it shall be to
report annually what changes are needed
in the customs duties ana internal reve
nues. The object is to take the tariff issue
out of politics, but the only thing it would
be likely to accomplish would be the crea
tion of new offices for politicians to wran
gle over.
â¢ p
The decision of the Supreme Court on
the telephone case gives a long extension
to the monopoly and disappoints many
expectations of the public. There is, of
course, no use protesting against the de
cision, bat some law should be enacted
which will prevent monopolies from play
ing the same game again. The scheme of
tiling a claim for a patent in 1877 and not
taking it out until 1891 so as to hold a
monopoly until 1908 is one that ought not
to he allowed to operate more than once
successfully among an intelligent people.
AROUSED AT LAST.
Reports from our special correspondent at Washington show that the officials
have been aroused to tbe importance of beginning the work on the new Federal
building in this City and that their present intention is to start as soon as possible
and push the construction rapidly forward. ,
â¢ In an interview with our correspondent published yesterday, Mr. Aiken stated
that by June 10 the entire plans and specifications for the foundation and first story
of the building will have been completed, and that advertisements for bids for the
work will then be made. It is expected that contracts for the work will be let early in
July. It is the intention to bave as much of the work done as possible before the
rainy season sets in, and Mr. Aiken expressed the belief that by Christmas the foun
dation, the first story and probably the second story of the building will have been
constructed.
The promise of rapid work contained in these statements is as gratifying as the
promise of an early beginning. We have had so long a delay in getting started on
tne building that there would be a great deal of impatience if the work dragged after
it once began. To prepare the foundations of the vast structure, and to construct
one or two stories before winter, will require the labor of a large number of men and
will go far toward solving the problem of the unemployed. The outlook is distinctly
encouraging, and we have good reason to be satisfied with our efforts to bring it
about.
While we have every reason to be satisfied with the prospect of Federal work in
this City, our sister city of Los Angeles is by no means so well assured of the work
which i? due there. The attention of Californians should now be directed toward
getting the work on Ban Pedro harbor begun promptly. There should be no longer
any divisions or dissensions between the supporters of San Pedro and those of Santa
Monica. The issue between the two has been settled by an impartial commission,
and from this time on all parties should work in harmony to get the enterprise
started.
California has had ample experience in the past of the folly of local dissensions
over matters of detail in affairs of National importance. If the voice of the State is
to be heeded at Washington it must be the voice of a virtually united people. The
swift success attained by the agitation for immediate work on the Federal building in
this City shows what we can accomplish when we pull together. We have at last
aroused the officials at Washington, and that success should arouse new energies at
home. We are on the right path now and are working in the right way, and have
only to keep up the movement to accomplish much good for every portion of the
commonwealth.
THE TELEPHONE CASE.
The decision of the Supreme Court in
favor of the Bell Telephone Company in
the Berliner patent case, while sound
ln law and founded on plain principles of
justice, is, nevertheless, objectionable inas
much as it not only continues a monopoly
which is adverse to public interests, but
offers large inducements for frauds in the
Patent Offics and tends to encourage the
commission of them. .
The Berliner invention, which covers an
important part of the commercial tele
phone, was originally filed in the Patent
Office in 1877, after which it passed into
the possession of the Bell Company. For
some reason the patent was not issued
until 1891. A claim was made by a rival
company that this patent should run from
the time the application was originally
made and not from the date when the
patent was issued. The Bell Company,
however, claimed a right to the monopoly
for the full term allowed by law from the
date of the issuing of the patent.
The Supreme Court in deciding the case
declared there was no evidence of any
corruption or undue influence used by
Patent Office officials or employes to delay
consideration of the Berliner application;
second, that there was no testimony to
show that the delay complained of was at
the instance of the telephone company,
and third, that since what delay did occur
was caused by the Patent Office and the
officers of the telephone company were in
no wise responsible the patentee could
not be made to suffer in any of his rights
by reason of the delay.
The decision seems just inasmuch as
an inventor ought not to be made lose
anything by the delay of Government
officials, but at the same time it will be
seen that if patents of great importance
can be held for vearj, thus securing a
monopoly for nearly double the period
which Congress intended to allow, there
will be considerable pressure brought on
Patent Office officials hereafter to make
these same delays in other important
cases. This is a danger Congress should
provide against at once and there ought
to be no great difficulty in doing it.
THE MARCH OP GOMEZ.
The news from Cuba continues favor
able to the sanguine hope that this year
will see the close of the long war and the
establishment of the independence of the
island. The march of Gomez toward Ha
vana has been almost unchecked, and
within a comparatively short time he may
b3 virtually in control of all parts of the
island, except the few cities and fortresses
where the Spaniards have collected their
troops. This would completely expose the
falseness of Weyler's claim to have . paci
fied several provinces, and would go far
to convince the. Government at Madrid
of the folly of continuing the struggle.
The march of Gomez, in fact, has a po
litical as well as a military significance,
and at the present juncture of affairs the
political meaning is the more important
of the two. It matters very little just
now whether the Cubans can take Havana
! or not, but it matters a great deal whether
| they can muster an army strong enough â¢
!to march up and down the western \
i provinces and compel the Spaniards to i
j retire from the field to the protection of '
] breastworks. By a display of strength they
' may make it certain they are not ready j
â  to yield, and the Spaniards cannot force ;
' them to do so without a much larger army !
than Spain has at present in the island.
\ This being demonstrated, the Government j
â  at Madrid will be more inclined to make
! peace than it would have been had the
i march not been made.
The situation which confronts Spain is '
: a bankrupt treasury at home, a demor- .
! alized army shut up in garrisons, a hos- ,
j tile public opinion throughout the civ- j
ilized world and a foe resolute, confident
and aggressive. Neither her generals nor ,
j her statesmen can hope for a speedy end
j ing of the war by a victory over the
I patriots. They must either be prepared to
! spend millions of money for an indefinite j
j continuance of hostilities or they must ar- j
! range to make terms for abandoning the
island. The march of Gomez will help \
them to make up their minds on that j
point, and therefore as a piece of political |
strategy it is likely to accomplish much, â 
\ even if it has no great successes from a
i military point of view. * â¢â .
When the tariff comes up for discussion .
|in the Senate this time there will be j
i missed many a Democrat who made Rome j
j howl during the last tariff debate in that j
j body. Voorhees is dead; Hill, Blackburn, i
I Palmer, Pugh and Vilas are in retirement,
! George is sick, Call is seeking a re-election
| in Florida, and about the only men who
! can be expected to make much noise are
i Gorman, Vest, Morgan, Mills and Turpie. .
! It is probable, moreover, that some of
| these will sing low and show they have
profited by the warning of the fate of *
! those who made the most noise before.
In his address at the celebration of the
anniversary of the treaty, of peace of 1871
Prince Bismarck said one advantage of
growing old is that a man with increasing
years becomes less sensitive to hatred and
calumny and develops more and more a
capacity for love and good will. The doc
trine is a cheerful one, and let us hope the
old diplomatist Was not using words to
conceal ideas when he uttered it.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 12, 1897.
A PURE-POOD PAIR.
lt is announced that the next exhibit of
the Mechanics' Institute, which ie to be
he'd from August 17 to September 18, will
be largely devoted to exhibits of pure
focd. This will be gratifying to the gen
eral public, for at the present time much
interest is taken in the subject of food
products, and there can be no question
that great benefits will be derived both for
consumers and producers of standard arti
cles by such an exhibition.
There is no State in the Union which
can make a better exhibition of pure-food
articles than California. Certainly none
has equal resources in the way of raw ma
terial for making such exhibits. Our State
produces almost everything, from the
necessaries to the luxuries of life, and we
have sufficient skill and capital to work
them up in the most finished forms. If
we have not done so in the past it has
been largely due to the sale of adulterated
goods, with which the manufacturers of
pure foods could not compete. The sale
of these base articles has been due mainly
to the fact that consumers were ignorant
of the extent of the adulterations. If,
therefore, we can make known what
brands of food are pure, there will be a
belter demand for them and larger in
ducements for their manufacture.
The proposed exhibit will materially aid
in making these good brands known to
the people. It is certain they will attract
large attention from the public, inasmuch
as popular interest has been aroused on
the subject and will increase rather than
diminish from now until the exhibition is
held. The decision of the Mechanics' In
stitute therefore to devote a laree space at
the next fair to such an exposition is a
commendable one, and good results may
be expected from it.

UNCLE McKINLEY`S
VAST PETITION
It Resistlessly Grows to Be
the Biggest This City
: Ever Got Up.
Twenty-Five Thousand Have Al
ready Asked" the President
to "Name Him.
-."' â >"'â ..-. -..â .'"'.â -. â¢-â -?- -"--
The Postmaster-ship and Sim Backus
Seem Disposed Of b/ a Beuifl
cent Fate.
'' . *
Twenty-two thousand and odl citizens
of San Francisco have asked President
McKinley to make his uncle, Benjamin
McKinley, Postmaster at San Francisco.
That seems the foreshadow of a beneficent
fate. * X I J
Bat that petition for this avuncular ap
pointment is going to be lots bigger than
that. It is expected that when tha time
for naming the Postmaster that Frank
McCoppin is just now preceding reaches
the President he will find before him a
petition from this City bearing 40,000
names asking for the promotion of the
present efficient superintendent of Station
F Postoflice in the Western Addition.
Benjamin McKinley's campaign is a
quiet but a speedy one. When The Call
first announced his ambition a few days
a-o the petitions had received 6000 names.
So many and so active are the friends who
cordially enlisted in his behalf that the
180 petitions in circulation have since
then received 14,000 more signatures.
The prophecy is probably a true one
that thi? petition will be the largest one
ever sent to Washington from this City
and the second largest ever got up in the
State, the record being held by one against
the railroad funding bill. Uncle McKin
ley's friends are finding a very general
popular willingness to see him "thus pro
moted in the service in which he has
spent so many years, and as yet no pro
tests have started audible vibrations.
Though Mr. McKinley has led the quiet
life of good-citizsnship on the common
level, he has become widely acquainted
during the many years if his life here,
and men of all parties readily sign the pe
tition, especially when his friends explain
that his appointment would not be an
arbitrary piece of plain, ordinary nepot
ism, because he is familiar with the local
service and its needs, aspired to the office
before his nephew whs talked of for Presi
dent, and has the McKinley worth, char
acter and ability fitted for the responsi
bility. -; '::
Tnere are many local names that sound
big and familiar on the petition, but Mr.
McKinley's ends prefer not to mention
names. Four of the members of the Cali
fornia delegation to the National Repub
lican Convention have signed. The only
members of the California Congressional
delegation who have any right to make
their own business of the matter are Sena
tor Perkins and Congressman Loud, or
perhaps in this case it should be Con
gressman Loud and Senator Perkins. It
is not known what tbey will do about it,
but many people think that they will
agree to the propriety and fitness of the
appointment when they think the matter
over. \ â â¢ '-*â â  &Â£'â¢â¢' ;'.:â '? -.Ji-y.'.- *â *:* i~
All this is worriment to Samuel W.
Backus/who is the only other aspirant
out in the open. Senator Perkins is sup
posed to be Backus' Washington cham
pion, and it is also supposed that maybe
Backus doesn't know just what he wants,
and that it might possibly be something
elÂ«-e. That was the case with Mr. Cham
berlain cf the old Dirigo Club when he
wanted the Postoffice at the same tim c
that Backus did in Harrison times. He
found out that what he really wanted was
a United States Bank ccnimiss'.onership.
However, Mr. Backus is quietly circu
lating a petition, too, they say mainly
among Grand Army men. The McKln
leyites learned of this, and have captured
some G. A. K. names themselves. The
appointment is far off, though, for Mr.
McCoppin'sterm lasts for another year,and
there is plenty of time for politics and
other developments in the matter. In a
week or two the McKinley petition, with
about 25,000 names, will be sent to the
President and copies to Senator Perkins
and Congressman Loud. The getting of
names will continue, and a supplementary
petition. will b â¢ filed later. , ;â¢
FRATERNAL DEPARTMENT.
The Grand Entertainment and Dance
That Was Given Last Monday by.
Loyal Rebekah Lodge.
It is not often that those who are in the
habit of attending the entertainments that
are given by the fraternal organizations of this
City have had the pleasure of witnessing a
more interesting and entertaining one than
that given last Monday night by Loyal Lodge
No. 215, I. O. O. t.. Daughters of Rebekah. .
It was given in the assembly hall of the Odd
Fellows' building, and as the place had been
arranged for the meeting of the Grand Lodge,
which commenced its session yesterday morn
ing, the decorations were purely of the Odd
Fellow order, and were very attractive. The
orchestra furnished excellent music, there
was singing that was very meritorious, and
the living pictures were as fine arrangements
and groupings oi human figures as ever were
presented in San Francisco. "The Odd Fellow
that we all know," which was given as one of
the pictures, was a bust of George T. Shaw, the
grand secretary of the order, who was seated
within a pedestal, which was so arranged with
drapery that it seemed as if a life-like bint
had been placed on the pedestal. The several
numbers were exceedingly well received, and
there was not one that was not encored, The
several pictures were: : Queen of the Fairies,
Black and White (an artist's term). A Poster,
August, The Wooing, On a Strike. Listening to
the Fairies, The Orphan Musician, A Poster,
Music, Song and- Dance, A Portrait of a Well-
Known Odd Fellow, .Rebekah at the Weil, The
Initials. '.-;â  -i

Eureka Hall, in the Odd Fellows' building,
on last Saturday evening, contained as
many persons as it would comfortable hold,
the occasion of the great number assembling
there being ap entertainment riven by Amity

J. 1 ; Newell, V. G. ; - Miss Maggie Jessen, Mrs. !

The Royal Arcanum.
Argonaut Council No. 597 held a very en
joyable meeting last Monday night. There
was present a large delegation from Golden
West CounciL The joint committee on the
celebration of the twentieth anniversary of
Arcanum day, which falls on the 20th inst,,
reported that all arrangements had" been com
pleted for the proper observance of the day.
Native Sons' Hall has been secured for the
occasion. J. J. Tobin will deliver an oration,
and after that there will be presented a good
programme and a dance will follow. Two
thousand tickets have been issued, and it is
expected that there will be a full house. ::?'
The membership of this order is still increas
ing, and it is expected that by next month the
200,000 mark will have been reached.
I'strelln*Â« Flag Presentation.
This evening there will be a great event in
the main ball of the Native Sons' building, lt
being the presentation to La Estrella Parlor
of one of the handsomest American flags ever
made for a parlor of the Native Daughters.
The affair is strictlx invitational, and as the
ladies of this parlor lire among the brightest
in the order they have prepared for a dance
to iollow the presentation mat will be a most
enjoyable one. There will be presented during
the evening a beautiiul souvenir programme
of the occasion, the first anniversary of the in
stitution of the parlor that has excited the
envr of many.
Independent Foresters.
High Chief Banger MoElfresh let his home
in Los Angeles last Monday to pay official
visits to twenty-eight courts in the northern
part of the State. Last Tuesday he was ten
dered a reception by Court Circle' City, at
Corona. On the Thursday preceding he, with
the assistance of other high conn officers,
dedicated a new hall for Court Central Ave
nue in Los Angeles. The event was witnessed
by all of 300 persons, and at the close of a
very interesting ceremony and programme
the high chief presented sixteen young men,
whom he had maae Foresters at sight.
Under the auspices of Court Los Angeles
there will bean excursion to Mount Lowe on
Sunday next.
' On the 26th lost. Los Angeles Council of the
Grand Order of the Orient will confer the de
grees on a large class of candidates.
The Native Son*.
The reports presented at the Grand Parlor
meeting contain some matter of which the
following will be read with interest:
Fifty-eight members were called to the
Grand Parlor on high during the year 1896.
Among those deceased are a number who have
sat with us in the years gone by in the de
liberations of the Grand .Parlor, the best
known of whom was xenial Thad McFarland,
whose towering form was a familiar sight to
the delegates of the Grand Parlors at San Jose,
Woodland. Nevada City, Fresno and Chico. E.
D. Tesreau of Sacramento Parlor No. 3 was a
delegate to the Grand Parlor at Eureka, W. G.
Hannaford of Rincon Parlor No. 72 was also a
delegate to th. Grand Parlor at Eureka, and
George Baker of Piedmont Parlor No. 120 was
a mi mber of our last Grand Parlor at San Luis
Obispo.
Numerically the order has made the greatest
genuine progress tor years past. Tne number
of initiations indicates that the march of pro
gression goes steadily on. Outside of the
parlors whose membership is lost to this re
port by reason of the resolution dissolving
them, d passed by the last Grand Parlor, the
order shows an increase of 527 member*, ln
addition to this, Rio Vista Parlor No. 199 has
been added, with twenty-six members, and
many of the parlors in which there is an
active rivalry for delegates have added many
members to their roll, whicn cannot be in
cluded in this report, inasmuch as it proclaims
our condition on January 1, 1897.

Thk Cretan Troublesâ F. J. 8. and M. E.
M., City. The present insurrection in Crete is
the ninth since the island came into the pos
session of the Turks, in 1669. The many
troubles on the island led in 1868 to the pro
mulgation of an organic law which made
liberal concessions to the Cretans, but it was
never put into practice. The Cretans appealed
to the Berlin Congress through the Greek
delegates for an amelioration of their condi
tion. A result of that appeal was the adoption
of the following, whicb was signed by the rep
resentatives of Turkey:
The Sublime Porte undertakes to apply scrupu
onsly to the liland of Crete the organic law of
1868. while Introducing into it the modifications
which may be considered advisab.e.
- Tbe Turks, however, did not trouble them
selves about the organic law and conducted
tbe affairs on the island with such a high
hand tbat in 1878 there was another insurrec
tion, which was followed by another agree
ment with the Christian delegates. By that
treaty the Turks were to allow the Cretans to
ha "a Christian Governor and a limited au
tonomy was granted. That arrangement would
have worked well but the Turks did not carry
out their compact. A Mussulman Governor was
sent to the inland, and then followed the in
surrection of 1889, when the Sultan abolished
all privileges. The latest revolt commenced on
July 3, 1896, and 11 has been followed by
tie slaughter of Christians, as bas been an
nounced from time to time through the press.
On the sth of last July the Cretans estab
lished a Provisional Government, and on the
24th of August Turkey announced its willing
ness to make a settlement and allow a Chris
tian Governor, the establishment of Cretan'
financial autonomy and the payment of a
tribute to the Sultan. The Cretans waited
until February 1, but nothing* being done by
the Turks as promised, and greater hardships
end indignities being heaped upon them,
they struck for liberty, and Greece responded.
The Cretans do not want independence, but
went to be annexed to Greece, Iv short, the
cause of the trouble is the failure of the Turks
to keep their promises to the Cretans.

terday's Lecture on " The
Law of Karma."
Mrs. Annie Besant delivered one of her
most interesting lectures at Native Sons'
Hall yesterday afternoon. Though ter
subject was the metaphysical treatment
of theosophy under the title of ''Karma,"
the speaker talked vigorously against the
dominant spirit of money in American
life. She held that the invisible law ol
Karma is made by thought, desire, and
the effects of conduct on others.
Coming to the practical phases of the
subject, Mrs. Besant said: "The thoughts
in this life make the tendencies ot our
lives on our reappearance here. If we
are of good dispositions here aud if we
cultivate noble impulses now it will be
easier to do good when we reappear.
"The vice of National life in tbis coun
try to-day is money - making, to the ex
clusion of all else. The money -making
faculty is one of the lowest and com
monest of all, and if we go on with money
as the ideal the future race will be low
and vulgar. . ~.'J ' ..V:
--"It is a friehtfnl condition when wealth
alone brings respect. The real duty of

in their fullness."

A Mass-Meeting to Be Held
on the Cemetery
Problem.

TO SPEAK.
The Richmond and the Western

Same Side.
SECRETARY MALONETTS GRAYS
CHARGES.
He D cares That in Many Cases

The Richmond District Improvement
Association by its resolution taken in
favor of having the City Cemetery re
moved to lands outside the county seems
to have struck the Keynote of popular
sympathy; at least so far as the district
whose best interest it is engaged in fur
thering is concerned.
And the club announces in emphatic
terms its intention to keep hammering
away until what it deems a nuisance of
the worst sort is abated. The first step in
the matter will be a mass-meeting, where
the desire of residents and property
owners can make itself most felt.
Accordingly the executive committee is
now hard at work on preparations for such
a gathering, which will be held a week
from to-night, at some hall in Richmond
District. if the success anticipated be met
with, it is very likely that another mass
meeting will be held shortly afterward,
this time in the heart ol the City.
Nor will the Richmond District Im
provement Association make its battle
unassisted. A powerful aid has been se
cured in the formation of the Western Ad
dition Development Club, organized
principally for the purpose of uniting cit
izens and property-owners of that part of
the municipality in an effort "to promote
its advancement and prosperity" by
bringing about the closing of the "cem
eteries which now affect the progress and
development" of that section. It is
hoped by those interested that after the
Richmond Club's mass-meeting the two
clubs can join in a harmonious effort
to arouse the whole City to a keen inter
est in the matter by the next mass-meet
in c.
The executive committee of the Rich
mond Club is now engaged in sending
communications to every resident west of
First avenue, and a rousing attendance is
expected. Both Mayor Phelan, who has
expressed himself in favor of the â¢ removal
of the cemeteries in public, and ex-Mayor
Sutro will be invited to address those as
sembled. â .- : 'JJ'\' Ji
The policy to be pursued and the nature
of the grievance may be gleaned from
some statements made by J. G. Maloney,
secretary of the Richmond District im
provement Association, last evening as
follows: :;!,";.
I have lived ln this region all my life, and
I know that this thing is a nuisance ot the
very worst kind. There is no man out here,
not interested, who does not desire to have
the cemetery moved.
The indigent dead are brought to these
cemeteries, and on many a boiling hot day are
left there and not touched in any way or
buried for three or four days. Flies collect,
and the microbes of disease and death have a
clear field in which to breed.
The superintendent of the cemetery is em
ployed at a salary of $75 a month and Ir al
lowed $2 50 for every body buried and $2 50
for every body dug up. This is true of the
Chinese d.ad. I don't know whether it be
true of the paupers or not. â  - â¢
The principal part of the cemetery is taken
up dv the Chinese. Those parts occupied by
other races have each a private superintend
ent and are kept in fairly good condition.
Situated as it is, just west of the Richmond
District, it is a menace to the health of thou
sands and damages the property of the whole
region That property is in a position where it
would be the prettiest residence property in
the City. . .â â¢ i *_'Â»;
I think the Board of Health should con
demn this cemetery, and afford somn relief to
the people out here. The Supervisors ought to
take some action also; the growth of the City
demands it. Both these bodies seem to be
composed of intelligent, progressive men, and
we are living in hope of relief at their hands."
Russian River Legend.
There are legends galore, good, bad and
indifferent, relating to numerous rocks
and vistas in California, but few are more
vigorous in bloodthirsty suddenness and
certainly none have been placed before
the public in greater typographical beauty
than the "Legend of Dah-nol-yo, or Squaw
Rock," on Russian River, written by Mrs.
H. M. Carpenter of Ukiah, and exploited
by the San Francisco and North Pacific
Railroad Company.
While illustrating the legend with a
number of half-tone sketches, the com
pany, with a true advertising instinct, has
taken advantage of its opportunity and
added numerous views of attractive scen
ery along the line. -

JAPAN SEALERS
IN HARD LUCK
All Struck Heavy Weather
and Have Made Poor
Catches.
The Trading Schooner Theresa
a Total Loss in Coal or
Cold Bay.
Retirement of Captain William War
ner, the Nestor of the Bay
Pilots.
Sealers and trading schooners have met
with very hard luck during the last sea
son. Two or three vessels are missing,
one is known to be lost, and nearly all
tbe sealers that went to the Japanese
coast have proved dismal failures. Pri
vate dispatches from Port Townsend re
ceived yesterday show that tbe schooner
Theresa is a total loss, while the General
Siglin "is pone with all hands."
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
City of Topeka, which arrived at Port
Townsend from Sitka yesterday, broueht
the news. The Theresa left here on
March 20 last for Kodiak, and private ad
vices state that she became a total wreck
in Cold Bay, Alaska.
The crew of the Theresa were: J. P.
Ryan, captain; C. Schmaling, mate; P.
J. Stewart, cook; J. Cunimerfield, B. Lar
sen, R. Reelander, seamen. Captain Ryan
was formerly mate of the bark General
Fairchild, now in port, and this was bis
first command as master. C. Schmaling,
the mate, was mate of the Winchester and
i a first-rate sailor.
The dispatch concerning the Theresa to
the North American Commercial Com
pany says: ''The Theresa, which left San
Francisco March 20 for Kodiak, is a total
loss in Coal Bay." The latter place is so
far out of her course that captains who
have anent a lifetime in Alaska think that
Cold Bay, one of the trading posts to
which she was bound, is meant. The
wreck of the Samaria with all hands is
now an assured fact, so that three vessels
that left here in tbe month of March may
all be considered as lost. iy T, "â â 
March weather did not suit the sealers
on the Japanese coast either. Many of
the vessels were damaged and the catch
was a miserable one. On* March 22 the
total catch of the schooner Pointer was
ten skins. On April 11 she ran into a
heavy gale and a sea which broke aboard
carried away the quarter boat and smashed
the weather one into kindling wood. One
of the sailors was crushed.
Continuing his letter Captain Bardsley
says: "The lee boat was carried away
overboard. Both sails on the main are
gone and a "boat on the main deck dam
aged. A quantity of water rushed into
the cabin, carried away the table and
threw the hunters in all directions. One
of the hunters bad bis leg badly crushed."
Later Captain Bardsley spoke, the
schooner Charlotte Cox. On March 17 she
had only seven seals. During the gals
the Pointer was caught the Charlotte Cox
lost a boat and had her pooprails carried
away. Three or four other schooners
were also spoken and all had the same
experience. The entire catch was only
eighty seals so far as reported. ;â  V.
The enlisted men of the Third Artillery
garrison gave a reception on Angel Island
last night, and the quartermaster's
steamer, General McDowell, carried their
guests from this City with the permission
of General Shatter. Those who came
from tÂ»e Presidio and Fort Mason joined
the steamer at Clay-street wharf, while
the Alcairaz contingent were picked up
on the way. A most enjoyable time was
spent on the island, and when the dancing
was over the guests were brought back to
the City on the McDowell.
The regatta at El Campo on June 20 is
the absorbing topic among the oarsmen
just now. Emmet Hayden of the El
Campo regatta committee, and who also
represents the San Francisco and North
Pacific Railroad Company, says that the
money for the trophies and prizes is all in
sight and that a guarantee to the Pacific
Amateur Athletic Association is now
ready. In regard to the refusal of the
Stockton oarsmen to row on that occasion
Mr. Hayden says that a communication
has already been sent to them asking the
members of the Stockton Club to recon
sider their answer and send some of th .ir
men to take part in the regatta on June 20.
Picnics are still the order of the day on
the front. On Saturday the St. Andrew's
Club will go to El Campo, and the mem
bers of tbe Congregational Sunday-schools
will go to Bohemia Grove at GuernevUle.
On Sunday there will be the usual outing
at El Campo, while the San Francisco
cadets will go to Schuetzen Park and the
members of the Manhattan Club will go
to Ouerneville. All the summer resorts
on the line of the - San Francisco and
North Pacific are now open and there is a
big travel by the steamer Tiburon every

Captain William Warner, the nestor of
shipmasters on tbe bay of San Francisco,
is about to shake the dust of California
from bis feet. His brother, , the - ex
president of the Bank of Commerce of
Boston, and now one of the largest stock
holders in the concern, has been impor
tuning him for years to return home, and
he has finally consented. Although past
the four-score-and-ten mark, Captain
Warner would any day pass lor a man of
60 years. Nearly fifty years ago he was
running steamers between San Francisco
and Sacramento, and to bim : it seems as
but yesterday when he was taking steam
ers up Oakland Creek, and passengers
were assessed ;$1 each. ' He ran the first
steamer up Petaluma Creek, and was the
first captain of the steamers Antelope and
Clinton. When the James M.Donahue
was built to run in connection with the
San Francisco and North Pacific Railway
he was her first captain and remained
with her until he tired of the sea. Ever
since be has been acting as freight clerk
on the wharf for the corporation, and
when he leaves for the East it will lose
one of its most valued servants. ( .
Chief Engineer Harry Jones of the

The old steamer Gipsyâ "perpetual mo

The California Athletic Club was expect
ing a favorable answer to a dispatch it bad
forwarded a few days ago to Smith, the
colored thunderboldt whom the club had
matched to light Frank Siavin in the lat
ter part of this month. The club's sur
prise can be imagined when it read an an
swer to its message which stated that
Smith had concluded not to meet Siavin
this month as he was not in condition to
enter into a hard fistic argument.
It is very evident that Smith realized
the kind of game he was booked to con
test with and rather than receive a good
licking and the short strings of the purse
offered by the club he wisely. concluded
to remain at home.
The directors were somewhat put out,
of course, but anticipating that Smith
might show the white feather they had
made preparations in advance to fill the
gap in case of an emergency arising. - ; _.
.Butler, the colored fighter, who made
short work of Baker, who is now in train
ing to right big Jeffries, was notified by
telegraph, and he quickly accepted the
offer made to him by the club to fight
Siavin. Butler is in good condition, hav
ing fought only recently, and be will ar
rive here on Saturday.
The entertainment will be held at Wood
ward's Pavilion, on the evening of the 31st

Frank P. Siavin and Joe Butler, heavy
; weights, fifteen rounds; Sam 'Maxwell of
Scotland and Frank Raphael of this City,
ten rounds; Joe Cooney of Boston and J.
Rubenstein of Sacramento, ten rounds.
Maxwell is the pugilist who made short
work of Morrissey at an entertainment
which was recently given at the People's

bested Savage at the same exhibition.

The Queer Freak of a Borrower
Who Abandoned His
Wealth.
Martin Scliwi: b cher Disappears as
if Swa'.ltwed by the
Earth.
Attorney Oscar T. Bhnck is trying to
find the owner of a snug sum of money
now in the hands of "Uncle Harris," the
Grant-avenue pawnbroker.
Martin Schweinbacher is the real owner
of the money in question. Some years
ago he entered the pawnshop with certifi
cate of deposit number 9037 on the Bank
of British Columbia, Portland, Oregon.
From the pawnbroker he obtained a loan
amounting to a fraction of the face of the
certificate, agreed to return the next day,
and then disappeared as if the earth had
swallowed him.
Months passed, and then years, and
Snhweinbacher never appeared, so "Uncle
Harris" has decided to make a thorough
effort to find the missing man.
â 'He appeared to be a sailor," said the
pawnbroker's clerk yesterday, "and the
money represented the savings of a long
period of time. He apr-ed to call very
soon, but we have never seen him since.
I do not know where he is or anything
about him, but the firm has decided to do
ail it can to find him."
Attorney Shuck has written to the Port
land bank and elsewhere to see what can
be learned about the owner of the certifi
cate. .He bas examined the Coroner's
record here and has found no trace of any
unknown dead resembling Sweinbacher.

The error grew out of the fact that the
suit was first begun by the husband, but
Mrs. Lallement met him on his own

proved the justice of her cause, and was
not only given a legal separation, but was
also awarded $10 a month alimony and

Judge Bahrs made an order allowing
Mr. Lallement to visit his son on Saturday

"that said plaintiff during his visits to

The Supreme Court has denied the petition
for a rehearing of the case of W. A. Sehorn,
convicted of murder in Glenn County. When
the case first came up for trial the Sheriff and
Coroner of that county were disqualified from
drawing the trial jurors, so the Sneriff had his
brother, who is a Sheriff in an adjoining
county, perform that service. An appeal was
taien from the judgment ou the ground that
the jury was improperly drawn. The appeal
was denied. A few weeks ago an appeal was
made for a rehearing by the Supreme Court,

FORCED TO
SUSPEND
BUSINESS
.
Announcement of the Fail
ure of Williams,
Brown & Co.
LIABILITIES ESTIMATED
AT $420,000.
Most of the Heaviest Creditors
of the Firm Fully
Secured.
IHE SOLE PROPRIETOR OF THE
BUSINESS ABSENT.
Left With His Family on a Trip to
Australia About Two Months
Ago.
Williams, Brown & Co., commission
merchants of 308 Market street, have gone
to the wall, owing their creditors consid
erably over $400,000. Most of this is fully
secured, but a large portion of .the liabili
ties was incurred on the simple credit of
the firm.
The firm was established early in 1889,
and then comprised H. A. Williams, the
son of the well-known banker and presi
dent of the California Safe Deposit Com
pany; William Brown, son ot Thomas
Brown, the cashier of the Bank of Califor
nia; W. M. Brison and F. A. Pasmore.
The lain named gentleman withdrew about
a year after the firm was launched, Brison
severed his connection about three years
aeo and Brown died about six years ago,
at which time Williams bought the inter
est of the deceased and thus became the
sole proprietor of the business. The office
of the firm was formerly at 116 California
street.
All the salmon rack of Alaska and of
tbe Columbia River was virtually con
trolled by the embarrassed firm, which
also operuted largely in dried and canned
fruits of California production, in raisins
and in grocers' supplies. The latter arti
cles were handli-d as agents for Eastern
manufacturers. The firm found its mar
kets in Australia, Japan, England and the
larger Eastern cities of the United States.
Of late Mr. Williams has also handled
grain and flour for consignees in Aus
tralia.
Among the connection* of the firm were
the following: Alaska Packers' Associa
tion of San Francisco; Fishermen's Pack
ing Association of As oria. Or. ; North Pa
cific Packing and Trading Company of
San Francisco, Alaska Salmon Company,
Hickmott Canning Company oi Oakland,
Nelson Canning Company of Biggs, Boui
din Island Asparagus Canning Company,
Shamell Packing Company of San Fran
cisco, Western Starch Association of Chi
cago, Bensdorp Royal Dutch Cocoa Com
pany of Amsterdam, Neuchatel Asphalt
Company of Switzerland; Benjamin
Brooks & Co. of Philadelphia, manu
facturers of soaps; William G. Moehning
& Co. of New York, and Delafield, Mc-
Govern & Co. of New York. In its earlier
history the firm conducted the Williams-
Brown Fruit Company, handling raisins
and dried fruits, with agencies at Fresno,
Sanger, Hanford, Selma and D&visviile.
Williams, who is now the only member
of the firm, left here for -Australia on
March 7, with his wife and three children,
on what was understood to be a com
bine, business and pleasure trip. He is
expected back by A. F. Thane, his confi
dential clerk and manager, who holds his
power 01 attorney, some time in June.
The failure was precipitated by the pre
sentation on last Saturday of a draft by
one of the local banks, and Mr. Thane was
unable to raise the money to meet the
paper. Realizing that it was impossible
for him to conduct the business any
longer without more ready money, he
notified tbe creditors of the firm iii this
City on Monday and called a. meetin gfor
4 o'clock yesterday. At tnis meeting Mr.
Thane presented a statement of the affairs
of the firm, and a committee of four was
at once appointed to investigate as to the
correctness of the statement and to report
on some plan of action to be tasen in the
future by the credit. The committee
consists, of D. Drysdale of the Alaska
Packers' Association, A. Powell of the
Bank of British* Columbia, J). E. Bowles
of the First' National Bank of Oakland
and S. Prentice Smith of the Bank of Cali
fornia. Mr. Smith is chairman of the
committee and has called a meeting of tbe
committee for Saturday at the Bank of
California. â  . - Â- -.Vr. -
In the statement submitted by Mr.
Thane the unpledged assets of Williams
are given as being about $200,000, but it is
acknowledged that this is simply their
nominal value, and that they will not
realize more than half that amount. They
consist of goods in warehouse,, bills re
ceivable and outstanding accounts.
The liabilities are reported in this state
ment to aggregate about $420,000. Those
secured are as follows: First National
Bank of Oakland, $32,000; Alaska Packers'
Association, $86,000; Delatield, McGovern
& Co., New York. $24,000; U. H. Dudley &
Co., New "York, $2800; miscellaneous,
$9000; Conaptotr d'Escompte of Paris,
$76,800. The partially secured liabilities
are as follows: Bank of California. 750;
Bank of British Columbia, $56,300; mis
cellaneous. $41,000.
In speaking of tbe unpleasant position
in which he * has been placed by the ab
sence ol his principal at this critical time,
Mr. Thane said that he became aware of
the fact that the firm was in a tight posi
tion shortly after he was left in charge of
the affairs of the firm by the .departure of
Mr. Williams. He further staled that the
embarrassment of Mr. Williams was not
due to any recent losses sustained in busi
ness, as the main volume of trade was
with Australia for some time past, and
this business had alwaya been a very
profitable one. He declared that the
trouble was brought about by losses that
were incurred two or three* years ago in
handling dried fruit and raisins, and that
the interest that bad to be paid by Wil
liams in order to keep himself afloat since
that time was what "ate him up." '
It was reported that the firm had been
speculating in grain and flour shipments
to Australia, but this Mr. Thane emphat
ically denied. Among the stories current
in this connection is one to the effect that
the firm lost $30,000 on a single cargo of
barley tbat bad been shipped to Australia,
because tbe consignee and purchaser de
clined to accept it on the ground of some
technical failure .to observe the charter
party on the part of Williams, Brown
& Co. isesn
New Depot for Hanford.
Contracts were let by the Valley Road di
rectors yesterday lor the construction of a
$10,000 combined freight and passenger depot
at Hanford, which will be of: brick and be
ready for nse in about two months. '

from day to day. The attendance con
tinues good and the betting brisk as ever.
. Fourteen very cheap platers started in
'the opening seven-furlong run, for a $300
, selling purse, and the collection of.jockeys
thereon was an assorted one. Rapido,
with Clawson up, was the touted good
thing, but never cut much figure. Picnic,
a 50 to 1 shot, made the running to tbe
stretch, where Con Moto assumed com
mand and won cleverly from Mary Nievez,
a 200 to' l shot ridden by a lad named
Kiley. McFarlane, the post favorite, fin
ished in the show.
Nervoso, a 10 to 1 shot, ridden by Patsy
Freeman, upset calculations by coming
from the rear and capturing the five and a
half furlong spin tbat followed in a drive
from .Blue Bell, the second choice. Bam
Leake, backed to 7 to 2 favoritism, was
third, beaten but a bead by the place horse.
Decision, which raced with Blue Bell to
the stretch, killed the latter's chances- of
winning.
Marty Bergen landed the winner of the
third, event, a five and a half furlong,
scramble, in old time style. With the
mount' on Naranja, a 6 to 1 chance, be
waited on Alma, the favorite, and Gran
dezia to tbe stretch, where he began swing
ing: clubs and in a drive got the decision
over Alma by nearly a length. Reel came
up and snatched the show from Sly. Tne
latter filly with any sort of a fair start
would have proven an easy winner.
The Hindoo horse Pepper appeared to
be the real thing for the mile and a fur
long run, and even if be was in receipt of
a little assistance from one or two of the
other starters, came home with the coin.
He was played from threes down to 11 to
5, and taking tbe lead in the stretch won
easily, over a. length in front of George
Palmer, the second choice. Hermanita
could bave won, but finished third.
| Several "uncorkings" occurred in the
seven-furlong : run next decided. ;. San
tuzza was played down, Fullerton Lass
received backing and King William was
another cutaway. Roadwarmer, the 13 to
5 choice, spoiled rit * all by going " ont in
front and, never headed, passed the wire
a length in advance of King William. Old
Mulberry toot the show.
: With Piggott in the saddle Lobengula
was a hot favorite lor the last race, at one
mile and a sixteenth, and setting the pace
from the outset won very handily from
Peter the Second, with the 100 to 1 shot
Charles A securing the show.

MRS. FERRY'S FURNITURE. .
John W. Fllnn Indulging In Some Liti
gation Over the Property.
The suit of John W. Flinn against Mrs.
Evelyn P. Ferry was tried before a jury
in Judge Hunt's court on Monday.
Flinn sued for $1000 on account of some
furniture and Mrs. Ferry responded by a
cross-complaint,, claiming $6000 because
she bad been deprived of the use of the
same furniture mentioned in F; inn's ac
tion. * â - â â â â

Attorney Frank Shay represented tbe A*

The difficulty grew out of the seizing of
some furniture by Flinn which was in the
possession of Mrs. Ferry at her house, 1107
Bush street, this City. There was a mis
understanding as to the title to the prop
erty and : Flicn resolved those doubts in
his own ' favor by taking - forcible posses
sion ;of l the furniture. The Sheriff was
subsequently directed to cart the goods
back to Mrs. Ferry, and in tbe legal scram
ble both sides found themselves to be
losers. ' â¢â¢:'., .::â â _-/':. >â*,;â¢ * .*. : . ;-.-.. 'K?.y\ :â >.-.?

LIFE STORY OF
ST. ATHANASIUS
The Patriarch Described as
"One Man Against the
World."
Father Gleason Ekquently Tells
of His Church's Fight for
Freedom.
One of the Host Interesting Periods
in the History of Christianity
* Portrayed.
Rev. Joseph M. Gleason, who lectured
on "One Man Arainst the World" at
Metropolitan Hall last night under the
auspices of ignatian Council No. 35, Y.
M. 1., was greeted by a crowded house.
President Philip J. Lawler of Ignatian
Council, after an organ selection by Pro
fessor Harrison, made a few introductory
remarks and was followed by Messrs. M.
Grennan and A. Guttman in an instru
mental duet. John J. Kaffael of the Tivoli
gave a pleasing exhibition of his fine vocal
powers and then Father Gleason was in
troduced by President Lawler as a fellow
member in the council and as a former
classmate. ;_;:': ?i
The speaker opened by remarking that
history Is studied now in a way that was
never known before. 'The ages long
past,"' he said, "were the ages in which
were laid the foundations of the modern
civilization. One great result of the
study of history is this: It has made men
.realize, that the Catholic church is the
greatest factor in the history of the
world."
History in the past, he declared, had al
ways been written witb a bias and a mo
tive. It was a kind of special pleading in a
certain cause.
"The church's history is studied more
than ever," he continued. "Does the
church fear the turning on of the light?
Not at all."
He referred to the encyclical of Leo XIII
exhorting the people to study tbe history
of the church nio-e than ever before in
their foes. Leo XIII, he said, went so
far as to throw open the secret archives of
the church to those who cared to peruse
them, and added:
"The chnrcn is to-day the same as she
was in the time of tbe Apostle Paul. She
might have changed somewhat in her out
ward appearance, but in her spirit and her
principles she is still the same."
The edict of Constantine was alluded to
as having freed Christianity, permitting
it to come out of the catacombs and de
velop in the lignt of the sun. This, he
claimed, resulted in a union of state and

The loss of manly strength and the many distressing evils which follow it as a
result of the breaking-down of the nerv* forces, is the crying evil among men of to-
day. It is too common. Men should pay due regard to the laws of nature, as all the
happiness, all the plea_u.es of existence depend upon healthy nerves and the organs
supported by the nervous system. Excesses will break them down, because excess
drains the electricity from the body, leaving the stomach, kidneys, heart, liver and
all otber parts weak. There can be no healthy nerves, no good appetite and diges-
tion, no vital force, when the system has been forced to excess. The electricity is
gone and electricity, is the foundation of all vital strength. You have lost it and yon
can't be well and strong until you get it back. . This is the purpose of Dr. Sanden's
Electric Belt. Does it give back the strengthâ the health? Read what' those who
have tried it. have to say: '*â¢.* *' ;'JJJ ;*;Â«-â¢

church, as the Emperor wished to regu
late the affairs of -. the church, and this
brought with it a deadly stint:.';/ "Many
hypocrites entered the church." the
speaker said, "because it was favored by
the Emperor. Even Bishops became
courtiers and time-servers, I am ashamed
to say. : Emperor Constantine, in 323,
when he became sole ruler of the Roman
world, called a convocation of all the
Catholic Bishops of the world, 300 in num
ber, to discuss the Eastern question, then'
the most troublesome problem that ob
truded itself on the attention of a Roman
Emperor. At this grand council the offi
cial formula of the Christian religion was
drawn upâ the famous Nicene Creed.".
After reviewing the remarkable career
of Constantine, he declared that great as
was Constantine, be made, his mistakes.
One of the greatest mistakes he made, ac
cording to Father Gleason, was in trying
to dictate to the Catholic church in de
manding the return of an exiled Bishop
Archbishop Atbanas.us of Alexandria. *.'
He spoke of the trials and persecutions
to which Athanasius, the defender of the
Catholic faith, was subjected by the
Arians, the enemies of the church.
"Athanasius, after having been deposed
from his position, was restored by Pope
Julius," went on the speaker, "after a
trial at which he proved himself to be
innocent of the charge of which he bad
been originally convicted. At the time of
his trial at Rome, a synod of the eastern
Bishops was called in the kingdom of
Constantiu-, one of .the sons of Constan
tine, and this synod declared that a Bishop
once deposed could never be restored.
This brought forth a polite but firm letter
from Pope Julius requesting the Emperor
to refrain from interfering with the private
affairs of the church. This was the
declaration of independence of the church,
made in 345, and from that day to this
the church has maintained that same
position of freedom from civil interfer
ence. . . '/ \'A; A : '-'J.y, .-I J.i'- : <- '.-
"St. Athanasius was the 'One man
against tbe world,' " he said. "He fought
against the greatest odds the world has
ever seen and won; because he had right
on his side, and right will always conquer
might, however powerful might may be.
"Athanasius lived for the purity of the
Catholic church and was the defender of
the faith against any interference by the
state with the church."
In speaking of the part the Cappadocians
played in the persecution of Athanashis,
he declared they were much like the A.
P. A.'s of the present day.
He went somewhat into detail of the
five exiles which Athanasius bas been
subject to and traced his personal history
until the time of his death in 373.
"There have been scandals in the
church. .Who can deny it? But the very
fact that the cliurch is to-day in its
primeval vigor and has survived them all
is th\ beat proof that it is divine."
He spoke of the ninth and tenth
centuries in the history of the church
as being most marked with scandals, be
cause of the authority assumed by the
civil . powers over the church. Hilde
brand t, known afterward &i Gregory VII,
was tbe brave man who broke this power
of the state over the private affairs of the
church in the eleventh century. He then
briefly mentioned the struggles since tbat
time which have been waged between the
state and the church in various parts of
the world, and declared that Pope Leo
XIII is to-day a prisoner in the Vatican,
and would so remain until the temporal
power of tbe Pope < was restored. This
temporal power be defined as tbe right of
tbe Pope to administer the affairs of the
church throughout the world without in
terference by any civil or state authority.

A. MEMORY OF A DIVORCE
CONTEST.
Mr. Shortridge Proves Flagrant
Violation of Law by a
Judge.
PADLOCK PLACED ON THE
BOOKS.
: Jadga Daingerfiald Lets Drop a Bit
of Law on the Subject of Libel
ing Candidates.
It is not strictly a libel to say that a po
< ll '.ical candidate for Judge is a disgrace to
the bench unless the assertion is qualified
as to detail. Editor Marriott's attorney
was endeavoring to shed some light on
J. C. B. Hebbard's past record yesterday
in order that the jury might know why
the newspaper man expressed an opinion
of a candidate last campaign, and the fore
going bit of law dropped from Judge Daiu
gerfield's lips to close the incident.
Among other things Marriott made tbe
"disgrace to the bench" remark about
. ..Hebbard, in addition to accusing him of
being more or less responsible for the
losses suffered by the depositors of the
People's Home Savings Bank, and Attor
ney Shortridge was for rehearsing various
actions of Hebbard to justify his client's
opinions. There was, for instance, a little
affair in connection with the suit brought
by George White, the Mendocino cattle
king, against his wife for divorce some two
years ago. Hebbard it was who heard the
case, and the lawyer was for showing, by
Attorney Barclay. Henley, what he termed
a "flagrant violation of the law" on the
part of Hebbard in the case. There was
among lhe witnesses one John H. Rohrer,
who was fined $500, with a sentence of five
. days in jail, for contempt of court. Roh
rer made his peace by producing the cash,
which in due course of law went into the
. County treasury. Hebbard saw fit, how
ever, according to tho attorney, to order
the money refunded to his clerk, Bob
Fitzgerald, who in turn handed it to one
of tbe attorneys in the case.
The moment Henley was asked to re
â  late the details of the incident Hebbard's
lawyers ground out a regular hand-organ
scale of protests.
Mr. Shortridge, in explaining the ob
ject of the- evidence, said it was one of
â¢several facts ha wished to lay before the
jury in order that they might know some
"of the grounds for Marriott's opinion of a
political candidate's merits for office.
"We propose to follow this evidence,'' he
continued, "by offering the court records
in the case. We wish to show that this
$500 was paid into the public treasury, and
that while there, beyond tne reach of any
court, especially Judge Hebbard's court,
we will prove mat he issued an order,
contrary to law, directing the money to
be returned to his court, and tbat it was
then paid over to one of the attorneys in
the case. We are charged with saying that
this Judge disgraced and disgraces the
tench he occupies We wish, in proof o;
this statement, to show that he reflects
the highest discredit and the highest dis
honor on his position.
"In this case, under the indictment
against Mr. Marriott, we are not confined
to small details. We are permitted to
prove the facts that led to people holding
opinions derogatory to Judge Hebbard.
If some citizen should declare that a min
ister ot tbe gospel disgraced the pulpit and
be charged with libel therefor, that citizen
would nave a right to lay before a jury
the facts which warranted such state
ments. In other words, if a minister is
false to his calling and to morals these
are facts that could be presented to a jnry.
"If It be so that a Judge of the Superior
Court, with wide jurisdiction, ordered a
man to pay a fine into ths county treas
ury and then withdrew it to put it into
the pockets of one of the attorneys it
ought to be made public. Such en act is
not on'y illegal; it Is in the highest
degree reprehensible. The man who says
this Judge disgraces the bench has a
right to put this fact before a jury. Here
is a citizen who for expressing his opinion
of a political candidate is brought into
court and is asked to justify it. It it be

true that this candidate is the companion
of drunkards, if he consorts with low peo
ple, ii he flagrantly violates the law and
tramples under foot the rights of litigants,
surely this citizen had a right to express
his sentiments, and now has a right to lay
this candidate's . illegal acts before the
jury. The citizen had a right to his opin
ion touching the life, character and quali
'. fications of a candidate for a public office,
and should be allowed to show justifica
i tion for that opinion."
Judge Daincerfield was for a liberal in
] terpretation of the law of libel, but be
I inferred that all Marriott's opinion re
-1 ferred to Hebbard's connection with the
i affairs of the bank. He expressed the
; fear that if the life of Hebbard was to be i
overhauled and matters not connected j
] specifically with the libel were dragged
into court the case might drag along j
j until next Christmas. It was not libelous j
! to say that a Judge was a disgrace to the
! bench. He might be petulant or cranky,
or something eke displeasing. The "dis
grace to the bench" phrase imported no
moral turpitude, and he therefore refused
j to permit the introduction of the story
Attorney Henley was about to tell into I
j the record.
Hebbard's attorneys then clamored for j
I the "records," which were duly produced j
i by "Bob Fitzgerald," Hebbard's right- j
I hand man Friday and court clerk.
The record was duly read. It bore out â 
Attorney Shortridge's assertions. It was i
â  upon the motion of Attorney Henry E. |
j Highlon that Hebbard ordered the money j
withdrawn. The sum of $68 Â£0 was re-
I served to defray the expenses of bringing
| Rohrer from Mendocino County to this
City, the remainder being paid to Highton.
, Attorney Kahn then attempted to justify
I his client's doings by staling that the
! money was paid to Mrs. White in tbe end.
Receiver Sheehan opened, the morning
! session of the case by denying that Heb
i bard had ever interceded in behalf of cer
i tain depositors to have their deposits paid
'in full. The details of the settlement of
i the account of the Lower Kings River recla
j mation district was then referred to, in
SOME OF THE WITNESSES IN THE MARRIOTT CASE YESTERDAY.
spite of the protests of Hebbard's attor
ney. Attorney Shortridge desired to learn
if Sheehan had not drawn a check for
$2532 14 to pay the irrigation district's
claim, when in reality but $1800 was de
voted to this purpose. Judge Dainger
field, at Kahn's request, ruled out this
evidence. '. â  â¢ Jf : " : : ", ? -Jr;; -'
The inciden* was, of course, one of the
matters that Marriott's attorney desired
lo put before the jury, inasmuch as Shee
han was the representative of the court
and Hebbard was in morals responsible
for the doings of the man whom he had
placed in charge of tbe bank's assets. *"â¢;â . â â¢
Sheehan's contract with the bank peo
ple for tbe Bale of tbe real estate in . the
bank was not allowed to be shown to the
pry. The ex-receiver, however, volun
teered the information that it was entered
into "some time last winter." In con
cision he stated that his acquaintance
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 12, 1897.
with Judge Hebbard dated back several
years.
On cross-examination Sheehan's $4000
compensation for the eigin months he
managed the bant had been allowed him
by, the board of directors, and that tech
nically Judge Hebbard had allowed Dim
no salary as receiver. Then Kahn strove
to have Sheehan recite lhe amount of the
property he had in his possession when
he asked Hebbard for his discharge, but
Attorney Shortridge contended that the
bank book? themselves were the best evi
dence on these matters. The lawyer was
willing to waive every objection if Heb
bard's attorneys would take the padlock
off these records and allow the jury to
see their content?, but his offer fell on
deaf ears. The books would remain sealed
as long as Hebbard and his attorneys nad
lungs wherewith to chant their choruses
of protest. '
The minutes of the bank directors' meet
ing ou January 12, 1895, formed the subject
of a lively wrangle. Secretary -C. E.
Palmer, who was on the stand, was not
allowed to read any communications that
passed between the Bank Commissioners
and Sheehan relative to the methods he
adopted to collect M. H. Sherman's in
debtedness.
When the depositors' committee was be
coming dangerously aggressive Sheehan
inaugurated a counter movement in his
own interests by instructing the bank sec
retary to obtain the signatures of some of
the depositors commending Sheenan's
management. Palmer succeeded in get
ting three names to the document, but be
was not allowed so relate the details of
the incident. Attorney Shortridge was
anxious to know what inducement had
been given Dr, Jenningson for the privi
lege of allowing Sheehan's friends to vote
that fraudulent issue of stock at the July
meeting in 1894, but H-bbara succeeded
in shutting out this information, as well
as the identity of the person who voted it.
Inquiries relating to the transfer of stock
by the bank directors to insolvent persons
and friends of Sheehan and Watt, met
with a similar fate. The balance due on
unpaid stock, and the actions of the bank
directors in collecting it, was another bit
of knowledge which Hebbard;s attorneys
would not allow to reach the jury.
Attorney T. Carl Spelling related that
at the time of Sheehan's discharge he had
made a protest against it to Judge Heb
bard on behalf of some of the bank de
positors, on the ground that a proper ac
counting had not been filed. Spelling's
formal protest in court .was read and in
troduced as evidence. Sheehan had ban
dled a large amount of money, and it was
but just to the stockholders and deposit
ors that he give a good account of his
stewardship. .* J- :
Attorney John H. Durst, who was the
legal adviser of Dr. Boushey, the former
president of the bank, related some of tho
history of the many-sided legislation in
dulged in by the board of directors. The
chief value of the testimony was Dursi's
statement that his client was prevented
from resigning after the bank failure, in
order to make a place for one of the
depositors' choice by Judge Hebbard's
famous blanket injunction.
Deputy County Treasurer Louis N.Jacobs
was called to verify the fact that Hebbard
had ordered the Rohrcr fine to be re
funded by the Treasurer. The point is
made by the defendant that when the
$500 fine was paid into the city and
county treasury it became public money,
and that, it was grossly improper for
Judge Hebbard to take that money out of
the treasury and give it to an attorney in
the case.
John Gamag*, who was Hebbard's pri
vate detective in the campaign, has not
yet been discovered. The Marriott people
hope to have him on the witness-stand this
morning, in which event the case in be
half of the newspaper man will probably
be closed. - - ;

Rebekahs Meet in Annual Session.
Veteran Odd Fallows' Barqu^t.
The first meeting of the forty-fifth an
nual session of the Grand Lodge of Odd
Fellows of California was held in Assem
bly Hall of the Odd Fellows' building at 9
o'clock yesterday morning, and there were.
present the following-named grand of
ficers: 'J. W. Warboys, grand master
A, M. Drew, deputy grand master; Karl
C. Brueck, grand warden; George T.
Shaw, grand secretary; M. Greenebaum,
I grand treasurer; P. F. Gosbey, James G.

grand trustees; A. F. Hitchcock, grand
chaplain; M. Forbes, grand marshal;
W. A. Noffsinger, grand conductor; M. G.
Gill, grand guardian; Ernest Dunker,
grand herald.
After prayer by Grand Chaplain Hitch
cock and the singing of the opening ode
the committee on credentials, tbrough its
chairman, C. E. M alloy, presented its re
ports.; -':Jjy^ â  â 
The Grand Lodge degree was conferred
on 267 entitled to receive tbe same.
The reports of the grand officers were
presented and referred to the committee
for distribution.
From the report of the grand master it
appears tbat one new lodge was instituted,
three lodges were consolidated, four sur
rendered their charters and one charter
was restored. He v.r ited 114 subordinate
lodces and thirty-seven lodges of the de
gree of Rebekah. The report shows that
liurinsr the year the grand master was a
very busy man.
The report of the grand secretary, George
T. Shaw, shows a decrease In the member
ship of 261, caused by the depres
sion in business; but the gain ; is sat
isfactory, there being an excess over
i disbursements of $55,587 91. The as
sets of the lodges snow an increase
of $37,370 60 over the previous year. The
average annual disbursement per member
for seven years past has been $15 80. The
number of lodges in the State is 350, with
a membership of 30,282.
The grand master recommends that the
minimum benefit be fixed at $2 a week.
Many lodges have been unable to pay the
$4 a week now demanded, and evaded re*
sponsibility by deciding, whenever.oossi
ble, that the' applicants were suffering
from old age and not from any specific ill
ness. He was of the opinion that if the
lodges should be allowed to pay $2 a week
they would be more liberal in deciding be
tween old age '-Â and sickness, and thus
would assist many a deserving old mem
ber.
He also recommended that all lodges be
compelled to place a limit to the amount
a member could draw during illness. ..
He says: "After the limit is, drawn the
lodge should be allowed to donate, in ad
dition to the minimum benefits, if neces
sary. Ido not think it for the belt inter
est of - the order for/ one or two chronic
cases to draw all the funds of a lodge and
thus force the lodge to surrender its char
ter and leave nothing for the otber faith
ful members when they are sick or dis
abled." ' â ;.',;'â *â¢
.The grand master advocates a reduction
of the per capita tax, which should be
made as low as possible in order to induce
members to join, and to reduce the bur
dens of those already in- the order. -,
v .At the afternoon session the reports on
grievances and appeals were all sustained..
The Grand Lodge adjourned at 5:30
o'clock to meet again this morning. In
the evening there will be an exemplifica
tion of the work =by a team from Napa
Lodge, which will work in - the : initiatory
degree, * and :by one from Observatory

ing the year, paying a well-deserved trib
ute to â  Mrs. Marian Greenwood, : grand

grand secretary, for their untiring efforts
in behalf of the order. ,
After the committee on credentials had
reported the reports of the grand officers
were presented and referred. _'â¢;.".''*'â¢"
Mrs. Greenwood iv her address said : ".*
Notwithstanding the financial cloud that
has been hovering over our fair State the past
year, it gives me pleasure to report that, with
few exceptions, the lodges throughout the
State are in a prosperous condition financially
and numerically, our ranks having increased
far beyond our expectations. The rainbow of
promise spans tne heavens, and the future
looks bright, and. with the approving smile
of hesven, what more could he asked of this
harvest?. . â¢ ""'*'.'â¢..

ters recalled, 5; number Rebekah lodges May

During the year 12 lodges were insti
tuted, and the "grand president visited .128
lodges in the State.
.In closing her report Mrs. Greenwood
returns thanks to Grand Master WaiboyÃ,
Grand Secretary Shaw, to the New Age
and California Odd Fellow and adds:
Also for many notices and kindly words of
commendation to the San Francisco Call am I
indebted.
To Sister Mary E. Donoho, grand secretary,
only one brought in close contact can tully
realize the value she is to the order; ever
ready and willing to aidâ the right woman in
the right place, and trust that her services
may be continued to us for many years. ' Â -f,"
The report of the grand secretary shows
that 187 lodges reported to the assembly
with 285 delegates. One charter was sur
rendered and five were recalled. It also
shows that the net gain in membership
during the year was 903. The total re
ceipts were $10,818, including donations
for the Orphans' Home, and the disburse
ments $1732 10. ','â¢' . '':,
At the aiternoon sessioa the only busi
ness transacted was the reading of the
president's report.
In the evening there was an exemplifica
tion of the secret work of the order by a
staff from the third district, San Jose,
after which there was an impromptu pro
gramme of literature and music and an
address by Grand Master Warboys.

The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station Indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath It, if any. the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in Inches and hundredths,
during the past, twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dolled lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to lew pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
roast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable:
but wben the "low- is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

YESTERDAY'S WHEAT MARKET. |
The following resnme of the wheat market is
furnished by E. A. Bresse, Produce Exchange
grainbroker, 412 Fine street.
'San Fbancisco, May 11, 1897.
Chicago.
The Government report was construed by the
local crowd to be bearish. As a -result everybody,
bad wheal for sale at the opening. â¢ The amount of
â ff'nnis s.emed inexnanstible, but notwithstand
ing this fact the man ln the air was taking, wheat
without much la convenience to the crowd. ' â  .
Around 72y_c for July the crop appeared ' to be
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 12, 1897.
for sa'e. : Much wonder was expressed as to who
the purchasers were. All day offerings were quietly
absorbed. Brokers have not heretofore been Iden
tified wi h lar_e : operators. The: use of those
brokers was to .hrow iff suspicion as to the real
buyers.
July opened at 7.%@72i/s", advanced .to'7-%c
ami dt dined to 72c ou account of a bear raid,
t-horu tried to cover around 72c their efforts ad
vanced the price to 7334 c, when reported rains in
l alitorniu stared a flood of long Wheat for sale.
Before the market was again In control of the
bulls July had dropped 10 7i:'4c Denials of this
report by tellable California houses made the
bears very active in getting back their lines. â¢
The demand for cash stuff was urgent. Export
ers reported foieigners buying at market quo a
tions. Export clear-np es largely increased. Liv
erpool tooÂ«: a bullish view of the Governm nt re
port to-day. Closing cables quoted prices %_)ld
higher than yesterday's close.- St. Louis turned
buyerduring tue last hour of the session,
p L'nsaii, factory weather tondltions started
shorts to covering. I'iices jumped %cbetwen
trausac. inns. The gain amounts to 13/^c from the
low price of thÂ» day, or s^c higher than yester
day's close.
Armour was credited with to-day's buying. Cud
ahy, i.inn, Phillips, Barret and Baker were strong
buyers during the la-t hour of the session. Un
doubtedly they, had beeu buy iuj all day under
cover. --p.-: ..
The market is heavily oversold. Many large
lines were put out under 70c. . The bears have
used every effort of late to depress prices and were
more or less successful, succeeding in bringing out
two or three large ines of long wheat held by
prominent traders. The Government report, in
stead of being bearish as first predicted, is decid
edly bullish.
Kasiug crop conditions of winter wheat upon
State repor 8 ana crop expert information, the per
centage is about 75.09 against 80 02 as s own b.*
the Agricultural Department. The lornier lepor.s
have heretofore been nearer correct than the one
sent from \*i a-hlngion. This report was made on
spring wheat. The late season has canned a serious
setback to prospects. The acreage will not be as
large as generally anticipated. \\ outlier condi
tions are no*, satisfactory.

A firmer feeling was shown in corn. Bad
weather, coupled with a bullish Government
crop report, set shirs selleis to guessing how
much tuey could make if they were to get every
cent that was left. The acreage is materially re
duced. Stocks are very much lower than geuer
erally supposed.

prices i'/n(i a ,,_c, a remarkable advance conddir

favorable as had been predicted.

Chicago also began to show signs Of weakness
about this time. Wheat opened at $1 26% for De

plenty. At $1 16% there appear.d enough buying
to offset the el ing.
Barley was only sparingly traded in. December

11:15 A M. SESSION".
A sudden advance of 1 cent in Chicago gave
wheat in this market a s 'in start. '1 he local
crowd had anticipated a lower closing in Lastern
markets. 'lo their surprise the top price of the
day recorded tne final quotation December wheat
sold between -sessions at $1 26%. and quite a

President Buteau Declares
That Fabiola Is Not
Fair.
Not a Resident Physician ol
the Regulars in Fifteen
Years.
Mr*. John Yuh Says the Institution
Is Net Run in the Interest of
Any Medical School.
Oakland Ofeice San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, May 11. J
The Alameda County Medical Society
held a meeting this evening and decided
net to lescind their action in regard to
Fabiola Hospital.
Since the last meeting a few members
of the society have declared that they
would not obey the resolution ordering all
allopathic doctors to sever their connec
tion with Fabiola, and it was thought
that at to-night's meeting these members
would be expelled. This action, however,
cannot be taken, and the only means of
showing their disapproval by the major
ity of the society is to refuse to consult or
in any way have anything to do with the
dissenting members.
Dr. Buteau, president of the society,
very clearly stated the position taken by
the regulars. "This is not a war between
the two schools," he said. "What we want
is an equal representation on the staff at
Fabiola and an equal share of the work.
We have been discriminated against for
fifteen years and we do not intend^ that
this shall continue any longer. We are
continually told that no partiality is
shown at the hospital, but this is not so.
Four-fifths of all the work done there is
placed in the hands of the homeopaths.
If the ladies intend that we should be on
an equal footing, it seems strange that
they should in fifteen years have ap
pointed only homeopaths to tbe office of
resident physician. If their desire is to
be absolutely fair toward both schools, it
would seem but right that they should at
least alternate the regular physician when
they elect him or her every two years. So
tar no member of our school has yet been
in that position.
"As a matter of fact we have been im
posed upon, because citizens of Oakland
who believe in the regular school have
done as much toward supporting Fabiola
as those who favor homeopathy, and they
have done it believing that the hospital
was purely impartial. As regards homeo
paths, Oakland is alone in her experience
in the United States. In no other city
have they such a foothold as here, and
the reason is that they are not honest;
they adopt largely allopathic, treatment ,
and still call themselves homeopaths.
There is not in Oakland to-day a single
homeopath who adheres rigidly to the
teachings of Hahnemann. If they did so
we would not care, but we do object to
being discriminated against in favor of
men who would not attain any success
but for the manner in which tbey pretend
homeopathy and practice allopathy.
"To have anything more to do with a
hospital tolerating such methods is un
dignified, ami we have decided to quit."
Mrs. John Yule, president of the Fabi
ola Association, has frequently declared
that the statements of the allopaths are
unmerited, and tnat if there is a pre
ponderance of homeopathic patients at
Fabiola it is because that class of patients
go there. The ladies state that no influ
ence is brought to bear on a patient in the
hospital, but that they are free to choose
their own physicians.
Buried Beside His -.other.
OAKLAND, Cal., May Amid mag
nificent Moral offerings the remains of Sey
mour Chapin Davidson, who died in San
Francisco Saturday night, were conducted
to their last resting place in Mountain
View Cemetery" to-day. Sweet peas and
maiden hair ferns covered the casket from
end to end. An immense pillow of white
sweet peas, white carnations and white
roses, with the word "Master," represent
ed the faithful Nino, who watched by nis
master all through his illness.
The deceased was a grandson of the late
Edward Davidson, for many years Consul-
General in New York City for the South
American republic**, and a nephew of the
Rev. Dr. Chapin of the same city. He was
named after ex-Governor Seymour of New
York, a fast friend of the family. He was
also a nephew of Mrs. Commodore Biddle
of Philadelphia and a cousin of Cnauncey
M. St. John of San Francisco. For a num
ber of years he has been assistant cashier
of the Fireman's Fund Mutual, many of
whose clerks attended the funeral. . His
remains were interred beside those of
his mother.
A Fireman in Trouble.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 11. â During
the fire last evening at the Houghton and
Baker residence, Foreman Bert Swan of
Hose 3 suspended Fenton Thompson,
charging him with talking back and in
subordination. This morning he reported
the matter to Chief Fair and asked to
have tbe action sustained. He said
Thompson used vile and profane language,
but the chief refused to suspend Thomp
son. y : -_ ry
Thompson accuses Swan of swearine at
him and will prefer charges against him.
Fair reported the case to the Board of
Police and Fire Commissioners, with rec
ommendation that tbey investigate the
matter. Thompson will be represented
by bis brother before the board at their
regular meeting to-morrow.

OAKLAND, Cal., May 11.â The com
mittee in charge of the Dedication day

stated that his purpose in introducing the
resolution was to see if steps could not be
taken to remove the building.
Firemen Kept Busy.
OAKLAND, Cal.. May 11.â The fire de
partment has been kept on the go for the
nasi week. During that time there has
been an alarm on the average of once every
six hours. Most of the fires are extin
guished by the chemical engines.
It was learned to-day that the disastrous
fire on Thirteenth street yesterday was
caused by a brush fire in the back yard of
Edson Adams. Mr. Adams states that
none of his personal effects were lost or
broken, and thanks those who so gallantly
saved his goods, as he carried no insur
ance. He claims that the telephone girls
refused to give his wife the fire depart
ment when called for, which accounts for
the start the fire had when they arrived.

State University.
The graduating exercises will be held in
Harmon Gymnasium on the campus in
the afternoon, beginning at 2:30. In the
morning at 10 o'clock the Board of Re
gents wil hold their annual meeting in
South Hall for the purpose of conferring
degrees. The academic council will rec
ommend to them 140 names for graduate
degrees and ten names for post-graduate
degrees. The class will be larger by fifteen
than any ibat has heretofore been gradu
ated from tho university.
At the exercises in the afternoon de
grees will be granted, iv addition to those
completing the academic course, to grad

This will be somewhat of an innovation,
as at no time hitherto have degrees been
granted at Berkeley from the professional
colleges, excepting only the department
of law.
Speculation was deeper than ever to-day
as to who will be awarded the gold medal
for scholarship.
The report spread abroad that Charles
Elston was the prize-winner. This was
denied later. It is quite well understood,
at any rate, as announced in to-day's
Call, that either Van Gorder, Miss
Schwarzcbild, Elston or Tade will receive
the golden reward of labor. The regents
will decide the matter at their meeting in
the morning.

THE SAN ii'KAJNWSCU CALL, WEDJNESDAY, MAY 1-2, 1897.
LARGE INCREASE
FOR ONE YEAR
School Census Returns
Show a Gain in Oak
land's Population.
Nothing to Indicate an Increase
in the Number of Resident
Chinese.
Only the First : Ward Shows ' a
Decreass in the R. turns of
School Children.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
. 908 Broadway, May IL )
The census of the school children has
just been completed and shows some in
teresting developments in the city's pop
ulation.
According to general rules, the increase
in the number of children attending school
indicates an increase of population of
about 3500 since June of last year.
There are now 13,857 children between
the ages of 5 and 17 years. Of these 1941
are in the First Ward, 2753 in the Second.
1945 in the Third, 1977 in the Fourth, 962
in the Fifth, 1361 in the Sixth and 2908 in
the Seventh. In addition to these there
are 4768 children under 5 years of age. Of
the children attending school 6822 are
white boys, 6833 white girls, 92 negro boys,
95 ne.ro girls, 12 Chinese boys and 3
Chinese girls.
Of all the children 18.055 are native born
and 570 were born abroad. During the
veer the First Ward is the only one whose
return shows a loss. That district had 156
children less than last year, while all the
other wards show a gain of from 1 to 200.
In speaking of the census return* Su
perintendent McClymonds said: "These
figures do not exactly represent the state
of affairs. There are other things to be
considered. The report shows that there
are 3363 children between the ages of 5
and 17 who are out of school, but this can
be easily explained. Children are not
allowed at school until 6 years of age,
while children between 5 and 17 are
counted in the census. Then again many
children are forced to be bread-winners
in these hard times. The father can't
find work, the children can, therefore
they must contribute to the support of
the family. The children attend night
school, perhaps, and so continue their
education. There are only eleven more
boys than girls in tho school, and the Chi
nese population shows no increase what
ever."
A QUESTION OF REPAIRS.
Who Is Responsible for * the Condition
of the Tidal-Canal Bridge ?
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 11.â At the
meeting of the Board of Trustees last
night the question was discussed as to the
responsibility for the condition of , the
flooring of the tidal-canal bridge. The
flooring bas become sadly, dilapidated and
will soon be in a dangerous condition.
Tbe structure was erected by and is the
property of the General Government,' but
there .seems to be no way to get the Gov
ernment to make the necessary repairs.
The Trustees do not see their way to le
gally use the city's money for the purpose,
urgent though the nead is.
It was finally decided to communicate
with the Board of Supervisor.-, and ask
them to make the needed repairs. But
under the ruling of the District Attorney j
that the county cannot legally construct
bridges or tunnels within the limits of in
corporated cities" it is difficult to see bow
the Supervisors can undertake this task.
Altogether the affair iÂ« very much mud
dled, and it looks ns though it might be
necessary, to suspend ail but electric-car
and pedestrian traffic across the bridge
when the danger point for teams shall
bare actually been reached, which is not
far off.
Laundry Ordinance. :':.'-â  r'
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 11.â The much
discussed laundry ordinance came up be
fore the Trustees last night, and was
unanimously passed. Among other
things the new law provides that all build
ings used for laundry purposes must have
3-inch cement floors and other sanitary
arrangements, and it also forbids any. one
from sleeping in any house in the city
limits that is used a** a laundry. Because
of the radical changes in many laundries
made necessary by the new ordinance, it
was voted to defer putting it into effect
until July 1, so as to give the laundrymen
abundance of time to make the needed
chances. It is expected that many of the
smaller laundrymen wilt have to go out of
business, white the provision against
sleeping in laundries is a direct blow at
the Chinese, who sleep, eat and live in
the laundries. It Is not expected that
there will be any opposition to the enforce
ment of the ordinance. The Chinese
themselves say they will not oppose it,
and it rests with tbe property-owners
from whom they rent.

FABO-OEALEB HULSAPPLE.
The Most Important Witness Gives
Testimony in the Paulsell Trial.
Â»";.' W. E. Paulsell is. once more on trial in
Judge Carroll Cook's court on a charge of
robbim: Jimmy Carroll's faro bank: at 620
Market street at 2 o'clock or. the morning
of February 16 1894. ". â¢'â ". ."..;.'. ' f ,'Z~-V:':__\-
James E. Hulsapple, a faro-dealer, was
the first witness. He testified that he had
possession of the faro bank on the night
of the robbery, and once more he told the
story of the entrance of -' the masked men
and bow they ordered him to throw up his
hands, and how ; he acted upon that sug
gestion. It : did 4 , not vary from what had
been told on previous trials. .
Nathan Alien, a colored man, who was
in the 'room ." at . the time, ~ corroborated
11 uls apple's story. . : Â
There does not appear to be any at
tempt to directly identify Paulsell by
these witnesses as one of the robbers, as
the robber was masked when he did the
work. An effort will be made, however,
to show that Paulsell was the person who
ran out of the doorway and . was arrested
with a bag full of gold in his coat-pocket.
Paulsell's defense will be that he is the
victim of circumstances. He will intro
duce witnesses to prove that he was going

robbers coming down ; that they all heard
he cry of alarm raised by the people in
the gambling-room, and that the real
ro: b*rs, fearing detection, thrust the bags
of gol 1 in Paulsell's coat-pocket and made
good their escape. Tiey also left behind
i hem their masks and their mackintoshes,
one of which was thrown loosely over
Paulsell's shoulders. It is argued by
Paulsell's friends that if be had been one
of the robbers he would have had the
mackintosh on and that it would not
bave been hanging loosely over bis
shoulders.
Paulsell was tried twice before on this
charge. On the first trial the jury. dis
agreed, ana the second time the verdict of
conviction was set aside because the Su
preme Court found fault with the instruc
tions given to the jury by the trial Judge.

SLOWLY SINKING
INTO THE SEA
Waves Lapping Higher and
Higher on This
Coast.
Professor Lawson's Startling
Statement to the Science
Association.
Between Russian River and Monterey
the Land Is Steadily yi
Falling;.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 11.â his
lecture before the Science Association of
the State University last evening Pro
fessor A. C. Lawson, the mineralogist, ex
pressed tbe idea that a gradual subsidence
of the earth's crust is taking place on the
Pacific coast between Russian River and
Monterey Bay and declared that a .con
siderable sinking had occurred during
recent geological periods. He said:
There is plenty of evidence of recent sub
sidence in the bay of San Francisco and the
process is probably going on now, but slowly.
At Toraales there are unmistakable signs of
such movements of the earth's crust. To
males Bay is a flooded stream valley, a de
pression into which the tide has flooded, and
lt is filling and enlarging rapidly. At Drakes
Bay and Bolinas a similar state of affairs is
apparent. There are finger-like bays running
into the hills, due primarily to streams com
ing down the hills, and now all filled with
salt water; that has advanced into the de
pressions. â ". â!i- id ;:';.'â¢ â â¢"â¢
Behind Sausalito is the Rodeo Lagoon, a val
ley caused by stream erosion and now invaded
by salt water, which has encroached 'as the
land sunk. Lake Merced at South San Fran
cisco Is a similar basin, it was caused by a
confluence of stream valleys and was subse
quently invaded by seas. When flrst discov
ered its bottom was ten feet below the tide and
it was doubtless filled with salt water, but
drifting sand has blocked ut, the entrance and
fresh water has driven out the salt. . -----
Inside the bay of San Francisco there is
plenty of evidence of subsidence. The topog
raphy around Sausalito and the evident recent
encroachments ot water leave no room tor
doubt of -considerable sinking, and there is
no reason to suppose it has ceased. The isl
ands of the bay are nothing more than low
hills in an old land valley such as that of San
Jo<e or Napa. The inlets that reach to San
Rafael, Petaluma and Napa are filled-up arms
of the bay, which water has reached in its
slow advance upon the earth.
Professor Lawson said that the region
of the coast in the extreme north, at
Alaska and British Columbia, has been
very much higher than it is now. South
ward to Cape Mendocino, the coast of
Oregon, Washington and the northern
part of California exhibits a contrary state
of affairs, having risen many hundreds of
feet, probably over a thousand. . The rise
was followed by a slight depression. From
Mendocino to the Russian River tbe ele
vation that has taken place amounts to
from 1600 to 2000 feet and was not followed
by a subsequent depression as in the coast
line immediately north of Mendocino.
Similar diversity exists south of Monte
rey, some regions showing signs of eleva
tion and others of depression.
AGAINST POOL-SELLING.
The Supervisors Consider Two
M asures to Suppress
Gambling.
Mr. Rivers Combats Betting on Horse
races and Mr. Britt the Poker
GamÂ°s
It is evident that there is a sentiment in
the Board of Supervisors to crush out
gambling in all its forms, judging from
the tenor of two measures that were pre
sented at Monday's meeting. 'Jjj,y
One, offered by Supervisor Rivers, and
passed to print, appeared on its face to
give poolrooms where horseraces were
formerly "played" an opportunity ot re
opening, but Its author says that he in
tended it for a totally different object. It
was a resolution repealing order 3048,
passed by the' last previous board prohibit
ing the selling of pools, boot-making, or
betting in any form outside of the con
fines of a racetrack, on any borseracing
event. There was no discussion of the
resolution and it went to print. Â»
Afterward Supervisor Rivers stated that
th* measure, if finally adopted byth*
board, would have the effect of stopping
all horserace gambling. He declared that
thousands of young men were being
ruined by "playing the races," and that
in the interests of the City and its in
habitants the bookmakers should be
suppressed. J!i'' *-"â â¢ y,. .-.*?
"There is a State law," said Mr. Rivers,
"that prohibits this kind of gambling, ana
if the measure passed by the last board
was done away with and the laws prop
erly enforced the bookmakers cottld be
forced out of business. -,
"It is time that this City should be
taken out of the category of places where
everything goes, and we can make no bet
ter beginning than by suppressing gam
bling. My measure will also uo away with
betting on priz -fights." 'JjJr-'-'y.
The other measure directed against
gambling emanated from Supervisor Britt,
who offered a resolution intended to pre
vent card-playing for stakes in saloons ana
other > resorts. He explained that open
games were conducted in many saloons
mat come under the head of banking
games. He suggested that the attention
of the Police Department be called to the
games. â 'â¢ â¢ '.J'J^J'J:^yyj'-- ! !
Supervisor Smith said that the police
were powerless to suppress the evil, as
they bad made many arrests but had not
been supported by the courts. He thought
the proposed legislation, might remedy
the matter.: The ordinance was referred
to the Judiciary Committee.
PUNISHED HIS PUG.
W. B. Tyler, an Attorney, Fined in the
:T Police Court Tor Beating a
<- \; -'. â ".' Dog;. . :-/-
W. B. Tyler was fined $5 yesterday
morning in Judge Low's Police Court for
beating a pug dog. â -- -^ Â£
Last Sunday, in the presence of several
hundred people at tho Cliff House, Tyler
became angered because his dog would not
obey his commands. , He picked up ' the
pug with his left hand and punched him
with his right until the unfortunate beast
was rescued, almost dead, by a few men of
heart who saw the affair. -

A Ninety-Eight Per Cent R publican
Stepped Over by a Seventy-Five

At a regular meeting of the Continental
League last evening, President Frank D.
Worth in the chair, the following was
read by Recording Secretary R'ggins and
received with applause: " '"> . '

â X i; . ,:> -' â  -i, ' Washington, April 5, 1897. .

Sib: The President directs me to return
thanks for sending him a copy of the reso
lutions passed by the Continental League
March 4, 1897, commending his action in
selecting the Honorable Joseph McKenna as
a member of hi* Cabinet. Very truly yours,
Joseph Addison Pouter,
Secretary to the President.
Amos Currier introduced the following
resolution, which was unanimously adopt
ed, and copies were ordered sent to our
representatives in Congress: y:.JyJJjJy
Wheeeas, Benjamin F. McKinley, a member
of the Continental League, la a candidate for
the position of Postmaster of San Francisco;

with B. F. McKinley and knowing his experi
ence, ability and fitness for the position, here
by heartily Indorse and recommend him to
our Senators and Representatives in Congress
and request them to use their influence in his
behalf and secure for him the position to
which he aspires. '".*" " ; '.";
Chairman Worth appointed the follow
ing as the executive committee: Amos
Currier, Dawson Mayer, H. W. Mathews,
M. S. Torres and Frank Roney. â '').
Assemblyman Leon Â£. Jones, on being
called upon for a speech, said that he was
a Jacksonian Democrat when it came to
patronage, and was a firm believer in the
motto, "To the victors belong the spoils."
When Abraham Lincoln took his seat
as President of the United states on the
4th of March the Southern Democrats re
signed their positions and remained Demo
crats, while the Northern Democrats \ re
tained their positions and became Repub
licans. Since that time the Republicans
had continuous control of the Govern
ment with the exception of eight years of
Cleveland's administration. When Cleve
land went into office 95 percent of public
officers were Republicans. Within that
eight years' period Cleveland bad changed
that ratio to 75 per cent of Democrots.
Then he threw t c blanket of civil service
over their shoulders so that those Demo
crats might retain their offices for life.
Mr. Jones was at a loss to explain why
a man whose duty it was to sweep the
floor of the mint should require any edu
cation to know how to use the broom. He
thought that the Republican party should
rise above this little trickery of the Dem
ocratic party and remove the clique who
have been working in the interest of that
party under the cloak of civil service.
The questions asked on civil service ex
aminations were frivolous, he said, and
many were ridiculous. There were a
sufficient number of efficient Republicans
in the country to fill the offices without
putting Democrats into them. .'Besides
that favoritism was conspicuous in every
department.
Secretary Riggins said that he received
98% per cent in a civil service examina
tion in New York City, the highest of all
the applicants, and a 75 per cent Demo
crat was given the place.
Mr. Nichols characterized civil servics
as a creature of the -rumps.

"BABY JOHN" HAPPY.
No Evidence That Ilia Mother Mal-
treated Him.
Mrs. John Martin was greatly surprised
yesterday morning when informed by
officers of the Society for Prevention of
Cruelty to Children that a complaint had
been made that she had abused "Baby
John."
"The story current," said the officers,
"was that the child's feet had been
whipped until it could not walk, and that
one of its fingers had been severely bit
ten.
Speaking of .the matter last night Mrs.
Martin said: "I stripped the child so the
officers could be satisfied. Tbere is not a
mark on the babe anywhere." ';
Facts indicate, according to Mrs. Mar
tin's ideas, that there is a conspiracy to
rob her of the guardianship of her boy.
The child was the picture of health last
night, and he has grown robust and
beautiful and had the appearance of be
ing one of the best-fed and best-treated
children in the State.
M. Menier, the Parisian millionaire,
who bought up the entire island ot Anti

bear's ham being now a fashionable deli
cacy in Paris.

DELAY ON THE
HALL OF JUSTICE
Property- Owners Grow In
censed at the Dilatory
Tactics.
The Cohn Family Blamed for
Neglecting to Underpin
a Building.
Contractors Want Extra Pay on Ac
count of a Cesspool Discovered
by Excavating.
Indignation over the delay in the con
struction of the new Hall of Justice at the
intersection of -Kearuy and Washington
streets has reached a point where it is
Jikely that a meeting of property-owners
and shopkeepers in tbe vicinity will be
held to determine the cause of such dila
tory tactics.
Yesterday seven men were at work, part
throwing dirt out of hole* in the earth and
only two men engaged in the bricklaying.
And this in the face of the fact that an
approoriation of $300, 000 minus architect's
fees and incidental expenses, lies now in
the City treasury, whence it will be forth
coming in lumps as fast as the work
reaches certain stage., while the deserv
ing poor and unemployed are clamoring
for work.
Everybody concerned in lhe delay seems
inclined to shift the blame to somebody
else's shoulders. Thus Dateman Bros.,
tbe contractors, assert that certain Cohn
Bros., who own the buildines on the north
east corner of the lot, are entirely re
sponsible in the matter, while Abe Cohn,
who transacts the family business, denies
all blame and refers it back to the con
tractors.
"A sob- basement for elevator machinery
must be dug under that building,' said M.
C. Bateman, "and in order to do this the
walls will have to be underpinned. The
vest wail of the structure rests upon the
soil. We notified the Cohns over two
months ago of this and have kept at th.m
hew to-dat:

incessantly ever since. They seem to have
lon.i nothing.
"We cannot put a large force of men at
work until we can go to work on all the
walls. Then there is another cause for
delay.
"In the southeast corner of the lot,
where we have made excavations for
a foundation, an old cesspool was dis
covered, tilled with water. The soil will
have to be taken out to a considerable
depth in order to secure a solid base.
'The specifications call for no such
work as this, and we have made an es
timate of the cost and submitted it to the
Building Committee of the Board of
Supervisors to-day. .We will meet in con
ference with the architects on this matter
immediately." i.'vv.
A. Cohn denies that owners of the prop
erty adjoining have delayed the woik of
construction by refusing to underpin
their buildings. The., matter, be admits,
was called to the family's attention as
early as the latter part of January, and he
at once, so he says, consulted with an at
torney, whose advice was to watr, as a bill
was before the Legislature wnich might
enable them to dispose of their property
to tbe State. This bill was defeated in
March.
"We were again notified by Bate man
8r05.," be said, "and finding that the ex
pense of underpinning devolved on us,
set about to have it done. We wanted
the Hall of Justice to go up as rapidly as
possible, because it would enhance the
value of our property, but we also wanted
to be secured a.ainst the building falling
while being underpinned.
"We have now secured the services of
E. J. Vogel, and be has consented to give
good and sufficient bonds. By next week
the work of underpinning will be well
under way." * J yj.
That is bow the matter stands. Every
body professes to be eager to have the
wore proceed, on the ground that it means
cash in hand, and yet nobody seems to be
doing anything. The spectncle of three
or four men at work on the foundation of
such a building is enough to make a
wooden statue of justice shed tears.
But J. E. Buckley, the superintendent
of construction for the City, still draws
down his $250 a month to see a few shovel
fuls of dirt thrown out and two men lay
ing brick. That the Conns at present
afford a good opportunity for the con
tractors to plead necessity in delay can
hardly be denied, but as they have
promised to have their building under
pinned at once the building should be
rushed forward in a couple of weeks more
anyway. That is what property-owners
and business men in the vicinity demand,
at least, and will take steps to see why it
is not so if a much longer delay is per
mitted. " '"jj--:
A FIREMAN SERIOUSLY OUT.
Edward Walsh -stabbed in the Neck by
< harlet Nealson. *,' '
Edward Walsh, a stoker on engine 1,
was severely cut on the neck by Charles
Nealson, a carpenter, in front of the en
gine-hou<*.e. Pacific street, near Montgom
ery, last evening.
Walsh was converging with a young
woman when the trouble that culminated
in the cutiing began. Nealson crowded
up against the young w. man and Walsh,
believing his action uncalled for, pushed
him in;o the street. i>~-'^;J. 'â ,-:> -i'..---;
Nealson then drew a knife and. rushing
up to Walsh, stabbed him in the .neck.
Several persons who witnessed the cat
ting hurried out and secured the knife*
wielder. Walsh was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where bis wound, wh eh ex
tends from the back of his head to bis
chin, was dressed. His ' assailant was
taken to the California-street police sta
tion and booked on a charge of assault to
murder.

License to Marry Irene E* CampbzH.
derer of Mrs. Philopena Lingfeld, who
died by bis own hand in a Texas prison,
has been solved. .
During all of his fruitless and somewhat
erratic chase of Blanther, during which
he attempted to gain a knowledge of the ,
murderer's career, Captain Lees was un
able to find out anything that would tend
to show wbich of the women with whom
Blanther consorted was bis true wife or
whether he really had one.
The period between . his flight from
Siam and his going into the employ of
Rand. McN'ally & Co. of Chicago was also
a closed book to the chief of detectives.
It now develops that the evidence of hi '
first marriage in this country, and pre
sumably bis only legal one, was all the
time within a few feet of Captain Lees.
It also seems that Blanther was, for some
time early in 1887, a resident of this City
before going to Chicago and stopped at a
prominont hotel.
Moreover, the true wife of the murderous
nobleman, Irene E. Blanther, has com
municated with Sheriff Whelan through
her lawyer, demanding possession of her
husband's effects. The letter was re
ceived a few days ago and reads as follows :
J. L. Hudson, Attorney and Counselor, )
Offices 1, 3 and 5, 508., Main Street,
Houston, Tex, May 3, 1897. . >
Sheriff of San Fiancisco County, San Francisco,
Ca!.â Sir: I hereby make a formal de
mand on you for any and all possessions that
you may have in your custody belonging to
Jos. E. Blanther.
I make such demand as the legal representa
tive and attorney of Mrs. Irene E. Blanther,
tbe only lawful wife of Jos. E. Blanther. and
whose marriage ceremony wns consummated
in your City Ui the year 1887. I understand
from Mrs. Blanther that there are some pos
sessions, which the officers hold, which are
contained in a large tin box, as well as some
minor possessions.
I make this only as a formal demand and I
trust that you will give me no trouble in re
gaining possession of this property and I will
appreciate your kind attention ln the matter.
Yours truly, J. L. Hudson.
Through a portion of the letter referring
to the marriage in this City is drawn a
line, apparently to conceal the fact,
though the typewritten letters show
plainly. ,
An investigation of the books of the
marriage license office shows that on
March 22. 1887, Josef E. R. Blanther took
out a license to marry Irene E. Campbell.
He signed the affidavit required by the
office, "Jos. E. Ritter yon Blanther,"
giving his age as 28 and that of his in
tended as 27. Tbe residence of both was
given as the Lick House.
In index 9 of the records of marriages in
the Recorder's office is an \ entry that
shows that on the following day, March
23, 1887, Josef E. R. Blanther was mar
ried by Rev. J. E. Cottle to Irene E.
Campbell. Rev. John E. Cottle is now
rector of St. Brigld's Church.
Captain Lees learned that Joseph E.
Blanther fled from Siam in 1885 to this
country to escape extradition by the Aus
trian Government, but tbe first trace he
was able to find of him in America was in
June, 18S7, when Biantber went to work
in Chicago for Rand, McNaliy & Co.
Whether he was a resident of this City
from the time he landed here from Siam
in 1885 until March, 1887, is sail a mys
tery, though Mrs. Blanther can probably
solve it. Blanther must have- been in
funds to have stopped at the Lick House.
Sheriff Whelan has : written to Mrs.
Blanther telling her that the effects of
ncr husband are not in his possession
and advising her to apply to the police.
An extraordinary find of French and
English armor, dating from the time
of the Crusades, has just been made at
Constantinople.-

ON THE WINGS
OF KEROSENE
A Grocery on Bryant Street
Scattered to the
Winds.
Pools of Oil in the Basement
Emit Gas as Strong as
Dynamite.
A $150,000 B!azv Destroys Patrick's
Tannery in South San
Francisco.
A veritable oil well which had been
auietly resting under Dominic!- Bolderl' 3
grocery- store, corner of Bryaut and Con
verse streets, for a decade exploded with
terrific force last evening at 6:15 o'clock.
The interior of the building was com
pletely wrecked by the force of the explo
sion. A few minutes later flames burst
out among the torn and twisted timbers
and completed the work of demolition.
An alarm of fire was sounded through
box 187, and after an hour's fighting the
â¢ flames were extinguished. . : ;^.v ? v^
Several people were painfully injured.
Bolderl, the groceryman, , wai severely
burned about the face and hands. He
was standing behind the counter when
the floor crashed upward with the force of
a catapult. Ue was hurled through a
sheet of flaming pa**, and fell into the
sheet in a half-stunned, half-smothered
condition. ::â 'â :'â â  uj.
John Paul Cinf, who, with his seven
year-old son, was standing in front of the
store, was painfully cut about the head by
flying bits of glass. His son was also
slightly injured in the same manner.
Gus Swanson, a carpenter living at 91
Converse place, also ' suffered a severe
sc*"lp wound.
Henry Newman and John J. Donohoe
were knocked down by the force of the
explosion, but outside of a few bruises es
caped injury. Police Officer _.. J. Thomp
son, who resided in a flat above the stove,
was tbrown out of bed and his wife was
painfully bruised about the head and
shoulders by falling plaster. *
The explosion was unexpected. For
over ten years the liquid that caused the
explosion had been accumulating in the
cellar under the store. Two large coal-oil
tanK--, one holding 190 gallons and the
other 60 gallons, rested in the rear of the
store. :j:.:: : . ' â *:
Iron pipes conveyed the liquid to the
front part of the store, where the turning
of a faucet was all that was necessary to
fill an order.
The joints in the pipe refused to hold
the rust-eating oil, and drop by drop it
fell into the cellar and prepared a mine
dangerous as one of dynamite.
Last evening the proprietor of the store
struck a match intending to light the gas
and passed the bit of flaming wood past
a crack through which flowed a stream of
gas emitted from the oil below. In an in
stant the explosion occurred, and it was
by the merest chance that no death re
sulted. .: â ''".'-
I The building was owned by Dr. J. C.
Donobue, who occupied one of the upper
flats. The loss on the building and its
contents amounts to about $3000.
A two-itory frame building adjoining
the store at 88 Converse street, which is
owned by J. C. Donobue and occupied by
Dominick Bolderl, was also damaged to
the extent of $200.
A two-srory dwelling. 1022 and 1022>_
Bryant street, occupied by E. Kinnee and
Heury Kempf, was badly scorched, the
damage probably amounting to $750.
Fire Marshal To we was informed of the
explosion last evening. After a careful
investigation he arrived at the conclusion
that no one was responsible for the ac
cident. __ â  -
A GREAT TANNERY BURNED
A. B. Patrick & Co.'s South San
Francisco Establishment
Destroyed.
A. B. Patrick & Co.'s great tanning
plant on Sixth avenue, between Q and R
streets, was totally destroyed by fire early
this morning.
The buildings composing the plant cov
ered an area of over six acre?, and includ
ing machinery, fittings and stock were
valued at $150,000.
j The fire was discovered shortly after
midnight â¢ by A. Calmit, night watchman
at the tannery, on the roof of the hide
house. .
An alarm was sounded from box 534,
but owing to the inflammable nature of
the buildings, twelve in number, the
flames spread with such rapidity that it
seemed useless labor to attempt to save
them.
But two buildings of the entire plant
were saved â a small stable and a store
bouse. '. - . J,:.ryjijf,
Among the buildings destroyed was a
five-story frame, 45x200 feet, and four
four-story buildings of the same dimen
sions. : ; â 'Â-. v â¢â¢. â¢'â ' 'â¢â 'â¢"'; .'' '.'
' - During the progress of the fire it looked
as though the California Glue Works on
the west and Legallit & Hel wig's tannery
to the east of the burning buildings would
catch re, so a second alarm was order -d
sounded.
It is thought that the fire started from
sparks from the glue works chimney.
Mr. Patrick, estimates his loss on the
plant at $80,000, $50,000 on the atock and
$12,000 0n tne building. The entire estab
lishment was insured for but $7000.
FOUR HOMES IN ASHES.
Potrero Residence District Visited
by an $8000 Fire Last
Evening.
Owing to scarcity of water four pretty
homes were burned to the ground in
South San Francisco last evening. The
fire started, it is presumed,. from the care
less use of a benzine lamp by some
painters in the rear of Goorge Malani's
residence, 547 Wisconsin street.
in ten minutes the building, a one-story
frame cottage, was enveloped in flames.
An alarm was sounded from box â¢ 518 at
5:50 o'clock, but when the department
arr.ved it \ found " but little ; water . with
which to fight the fire. J J
After : a'- lengthy delay a small stream
was turned on the burning building, but
it had no effect. * 'â ; . :
The fire finally* communicated to the
residence of Robert Scott, 540 Wisconsin
street, and that building was soon burn
ing briskly. At this time the wind car-,

Six Wooden Buildings on Tele
graph Hill Destroyed This
Morning!
Fire Started While All Were Asleep,
and so Little Was
-Saved.
Box 7 called the department to Tele
graph Hill early this morning to quench
a fire in the row of buildings on the west
side of Kearny and ending on Greenwich
street. '_;;,;â  ';-'â¢.' â¢ . Â' * ,
The whole row was ablaze, and men,
women and children were rushing out of
the doors carrying household effects and
clothes, when the firemen arrived.
The fire started in the house farthest j
toward the 'â  south, it was occupied by a
family of the name of Seville.
Mrs. Seville smelt the fire, and, rising
from her bed, she gave the alarm, Ina
minute the whole row was alive with the
unfortunate victims flying here and there
and the hill was ablaze with light.
The second house was vacant. The
third was occupied .by a Mrs. Lumsden,
the fourth was vacant, and the filth was
occupied by a" Mrs. Clark and her family.
The row was owned by a Mr. Bowen,
and but three cf the houses were in use.
They were wooden dwellings and burned
like tinder, and with them went all of
the effects of those who dwelt there. ;
The value of the houses will not reach
over $SCOO, so far as is known.
The residence of J. Chapman of 403
Greenwich was also badly burned, and the
houses of Mrs. Eliza Phelan. residing at
1559, and J. F. Furley, 1561 Kearny, also
sustained severe losses.
