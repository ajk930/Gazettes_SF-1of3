A HAND.
Crete's Demand for a Union With
: the Mother Country
Heeded.
STATESMEN UNITE IN THE BOLD
MOVE.
It Would Now Appear That All the Leading
Powers May Become Involved in the Island
Warfare Started by Religious
Fanatics.
. ' ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 11.â The Gov
ernment bas formulated a notification to
. the powers setting forth that Greece can
not remain a mere spectator of the events j
which are taking place in Crete, and that !
the ties of race and religion compel her to |
intervene in behalf of the oppressed and '
â¢ outraged Christians in that island.
In the Chamber of Deputies last even
ing Premier Delyannis said that either
the Pone would be prevented by the pow
ers from sending re-enforcements to Crete
\ or would persist in sending them there.
. In either case, the Premier declared, tbe ,
Greek Government had decided to take '
y action promptly and decisively. When
ft Crete demanded a union with the mother
" country, he said, Greece could not remain I
indifferent.
At the conclusion of the remarks of
Premier Delyannis the leader of the op- I
position assured the Premier that the
Government would have the heartiest j
support of the opposition, which assur- |
ance evoked prolonged cheers.
Tbe Cretan committee here is making
preparations on a large scale to land men '
and munitions of war upon the shores of I
Crete, and the first installment of 600 men !
embarked and sailed last evening.
Assim Bey, the Turkish Minister, to- '
day visited the 4'oreicn Office, and acting !
. under instructions from his Government i
made a protest against the dispatch of the
Greek torpedo fleet to Crete. Assim Bey I
was treated with tbe utmost courtesy,
but was informed, so far as diplomacy '
allowed, of the attitude of Greece on the !
Cretan question. His protest, however, '<
was so far as known productive of no i
result.
The Greek Government will not recall
the fleet, and furthermore a second flotilla
will shortly start for Crete.
The troubles in the island have caused !
many of the residents to flee to Greece for |
safety. Since the outbreak began fully j
8000 Cretans have arrived at the Piraeus
As in the case of the previous exodus i
from Crete, many ot the refugees are un
able to care for themselves, and the Gov- i
ernment will be compelled to extend aid j
to them.
Advices received here from Crete say j
that a fight occurred at Kastelli in the
province of Kissamo yesterday. Thirty
Christians and 100 Moslems were killed.
Crowds continue to surround the palace, j
cheering the King for his action in send- j
â  ing warships to Crete.
FLURRX J.\ MARKETS.
Speculators Would Profit by a General
European War,
LONDON, Eng., Feb. ILâ The stock
market was weak and flat to-day on the
reports of threatened fighting between
Greece and Turkey, and closed depressed.
PARIS. France, Feb. 11.â A very pan
icky feeling prevailed at the Bourse at
the opening this morning, but later there
was an improvement on the report that
the powers intended to prevent Greece
from intervening in the Cretan trouble.
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. 11.â There
was a depressed tone at the opening of
the Bourse here to-day, but afterward
there was a calmer feeling.
VIENNA, Austria, Feb. 11.â The Cretan
question caused heavy sales to be made
at the Bourse to-day. The market was
weak.
ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, Feb. 11â
COLLIS MUST PAY THE TAXES.
â¢ FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. ILâ Judge Alex Humphrey of Louisville left for
] New York to-day, where he will meet the chief attorneys for the Southern Pacific
Railroad and bold a conference in regard to the contemplated suit that will
shortly be filed against tbe road by the Attorney-General, unless the attorneys for
the road agree to pay the tax. The Southern Pacific people will report back "with
in a week's time, and it will then be definitely known what action will be taken.
It is now believed that the road will conclude to pay the taxes rather than have
an official recommendation for the repeal of its charter. General Taylor said to
night that speedy action must be taken by the road.

It is said that semi-official circles here are
strongly opposed to Turkey being ousted
from Crete.
MASSACRES ARE RESUMED.
Moslems and Christian.* Roth Perish by
the Hundred.
CANEA Crete, Feb. 11.â It is stated
on good authority that the Governor of
Crete, Georee Pasba Berovitsch, is desir
ous of resigning his office, but that tbe
Porte has expressed the wish that he
should remain here. The entire Moslem
population about the city of. Heraklion
lies entered that place, where they at
tacked the Christians and pillaged their
shops.
The Prefect of Sitia reports that 300
Moslems have been killed in that district
by Christians. It is reported . that the
Moslems at Retimo have blown up with
dynamite a number of houses owned or
occupied by Christians. No mention is
made of loss of lire being caused by the
explosion.
It is reported that Christians are mas
; sacring Moslems in the villages around
i Canea, and that thirteen of the villages
| are burning. The Moslem's continue to
| prevent the departure from the island not
only of the native Christians, but also of
! the foreigners. It is probable that the
| foreign warships there will intervene and
j demand that those who wish to leave the
t island shall be allowed to do so without
| hindrance.
Confirmation has been received of the
reports of atrocities committed on women
and children in Kisame and Kasteli.

CONSTANTINOPLE, TiRKEY.Feb. 11.â
The news of Grecian interference in the
Island of Crete has caused intense ex
citement here. The Porte has communi
cated by telegraph with the powers, ask
ing their support in the efforts of Turkey
to restore order in Crete, and the Em
bassadors are conferring upon the ques
tion of exerting pressure upon Greece to
compel a recall of the Greek fleet from
Cretan waters. The next few days are
awaited with great anxiety, as it is ad
mitted that the situation is more threat
ening that at any time within recent years
and that war may be the result.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. ILâ Much interest
is felt as to the effect of the action just
taken by Greece regarding Crete. The
action was not unexpected, as the events
of the past few days have pointed steadily
in that direction. What the effect of
Grecian intervention will be can hardly
be predicted, it is believed that Greece
would not have acted in this manner had
it not been assured of strong support, and
wben that support is better understood
it will be eaÂ«ier to forecast the future.
It is generally admitted, however, that
affairs are more threatening than they
have been for a long time. If war should
come it will be impossible to tell how far
it will go, as in the present unsettled con
dition of affairs it may involve the whole
of Europe.
SERIOUS W.tltXIJtG TO GREECE.
Powers Will Leave lur key a Free Uand
to Act.
NEW YORK. N. V., Feb. 11.â special
cable dispatch to the Herald from Vienna
says:
The Vienna Cabinet bas directed a roost
serious warning to Greece. It is learned
further from exclusive sources that the
powers have informed Turkey that they
cannot force Greece to withdraw her fleet,
but will leave Turkey a free band.
Anarchy is reigning at Athens. Th*

land is accused secretly of having forced
Russia's hand.
Even the ultra-liberal Tageblatt says:
"If King George is deaf to earnest re
monstrances his impotence must ba
drastically brought home to him."
The Neve Freie Presse warns Greece
that if provoked Turkey would be justified
in attacking Tbessaiia with disastrous
consequences to Greece. The same jour
nal publishes a telegram from Constanti
nople showing that the whole of the Cre
tan troubles have been long and syste
matically fomented by a Cretan committee
at Athens, which has sent numerous
emissaries to Crete, honeycombing the
island with seditious pamphlets.
This latest Greek coup was not entirely
unexpected in diplomatic circles, since re
peated suspicious inquiries have been ad
dressed by the commander of the Greek
fleet to the commanders of ships of other
nationalities in Cretan waters as to what
action would be taken in certain eventu
alities.
A special cable dispatch to the Herald
from St. Petersburg says: In certain dip
lomatic quarters lately there exists ex
ceeding speculative and nervous anxiety
concerning the Black Seasquadion, which
is collected and ready to steam at any
hour from Sebastopol.
Here the Admiralty staff has been
busied calculating exactly the time in
which the most rapid run could be made
from Sebastopol to Constantinople and
how quick the British fleet could get to
the Golden Horn.
As alarmist rumors are gaining ground
it will be useful to publish tne true situ
ation as told by one who has the best
reason to know. His words were: ''The
Russian fleet is prepared, not for the pur
pose of seizing Constantinople, but to
start at once if England were to attempt
any such movement, in which case it
would be a right to tiie end."
PA RU AN ENT BUILDING BURNS.
Damaging Fire in Ottawa and There Was

Destroyed.
OTTAWA 0-\T., Feb. 11. âAt 5:45
o'clock this afternoon fire started in the
packing-room of the public works in the
upper part of the Parliament buildings.
Owing to lack of water pressure the flames
j spread over almost tbe entire roof, and at
| 10 o'clock to-night were still in progress.
The offices so far burned were for clerks.
Some old records have been burned, hut
most of the valuable papers were removed.
The stationery offices and photograph gal
lery of the public works are in the por
tion of the building burned. There is no
insurance. The loss it estimated at $100,000.
At 1 o'clock this moi nine the fife is still
smoldering. The MacKenzie Annex,
Public Works Office, Marine and Fisheries
and Mounted Police departments are all
in ruins. Nothing but charred walls and
towers with a little of the iron work is
left. At a late hour the departments af-

fected say they did not lose any important
papers, though a batch of old records bad
disappeared. The Governor-General was
on the grounds.
A DINNER TO BAYARD.
Peers Were Present and the Embassador
Dwelt en the Ties That Bind Great
Britain and America.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 11.â The Royal |
Societies Club gave a dinner to-night in !
honor of Embassador Bayard. _ Among '
those present were the Archbishop of !
Canterbury, tbo Marquis of Lome and j
Lord Russell of Killowen, Lord Chief Jus- j
tice of England.
Mr. Bayard delivered one of bis char
acteristic speeches, dwelling upon the ties
that bind Great Britain and the United
States, and predicted that they would
grow stronger with the course of time as
the two peoples came to understand each
other better.
Referring to. the Anglo-American arbi
tration treaty Mr. Bayard said that now
the principle of arbitration bad been ad
mitted he did not believe the treaty could
be permanently obstruc ed, though there
might be delay in bringing it into opera
tion.
I'olsO'tid Their Husbands.
VIENNA, Austria, Feb. 11.â A story of
wholesale murder reaches here from a
small village in Hungary. It appears that
there were a large number of unfaithful
wives in the village who were desirous of
ridding themselves of their husbands in
order that they might the more easily
carry on their liaisons with their lovers.
Eighteen of them procured poison, which
they administered to their husbands with
fatal results. The murders have caused
the greatest excitement among the ; peas
ants, to which class the womenjand their
victims belong.
DAN STUART
AT CARSON

for the Big Fight Will
Proceed.

Track Will Be the Scene

The Manrg rs cf the Fistic Carnival
Expect to Seat Twenty-Eight
Thousand Spectators.
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 11.â morning
a great crowd was at the depot and wit
nessed Dan Stuart get off the train. He
was accompanied by Mr. Wheelock, his
aeent, and Al Livingston. Billy Woods
and Joe Egan, Corbeti's private secretary,
also arrived. Stuart bad come direct
from San Francisco and looked a trifle
tired, as he had been up until 4 o'clock in
the morning. It bad been a merry party
along the road, and the press correspond
ents say tbat they all had a headache.
Stuart had painted the car with cham
pagne, and in fact exhausted the supply.
He went rom the train to the Arlington,
where rcoms had been engaged, and
after registering he called the press repre
sentatives together and said : "The fight
will le in Carson. â¢ You can wire it to the
press." He then headed for his room and
went to bed. â¢ There was a race for the
telegraph office and the news was soon on
the wire, and it spread from mouth to
mouth, causing a broad grin of delight to
wreathe the face of Carson. /
Coming up on the train Stuart said that
there was talk of a go between Maher ana
Sharkey, but he did not seem to have
much of an opinion ol either man as a
drawing card. His idea was, however,
that a battle between Lavigne and some
man he might be able to find would be a
great event. Lavigne weighs 137 pounds
in the ring, and he regards him as the
greatest fighter of his weight in the world.
He is trying to locate some man near the
same weight who is fit to go against him.
A* yet he knows of no one who could meet
the great pace the lightweight could set
when called on.
The exact location of the pavilion was
not announced, but will be to-morrow. It
will be large enough to hold 28,000 people,
and Stuart expects to fill it. It will be
nearly square in form. The Carson and
Tahoe F.ume Company must have bad a
tip some time ago or felt pretty certain,
as the yard has been running full-handed
on lumber and dimension timber. The
place of location â¢ will probably be the
racetrack, as it is near the track which
takes lumber from the mill and close to
where the Pullmans would sidetrack.
The north half of the track is an ideal
place for such a building, where the
ground is as level as a billiard-table . for
twelve or fifteen acres.
Yesterday the town was invaded by re
porters, artists and kodak sharps who
were "shooting" at- every conceivable
place thsy could imagine, a big building
might be put up. The plans are on the
way and will be in Carson this week if
they are not already here. Yesterday the
location of training quarters was still in
abeyance. . Corbett's â¢ private secretary
insisted on baying the Hot Springs man
agement put up Â»he handball court, and
Charlie Slingerland was about town with
a subscription paper in the afternoon
raising/the amount. He succeeded very
easily in securing it and Corbett will train
tbere and the court will co up at once. ...
j As soon as this was known there was a
rush of reporters and kodak people to the
spot and the livery men began to experi
ence the immediate effects of the "P. R."
law. They now keep horses bitched up
to buggies ready to race off anywhere at
a moment's notice at the beck and call
of newspaper correspondents who are
after scoops.
It was known last evening that Fred
Dangberg bad offered Stuart tbe old base
ball grounds near the box factory for
nothing if he would build there. Circus
exhibits, baseball matches and football
matches have hallowed the spot to sports
men, but as it was only 250 feet square
it was regarded as rather small, and noth
ing about Carson seems quite big enough
but the racetrack. There is talk of put
ling up a Tattersall hotel and making it a
sporting headquarters, but any attempt
on the part of the promoters of the scheme
to purchase a lot on Main street suitable
for such a building is met by a demand
for money enough to pave the ground
with gold. This wretched policy will kill
all the intentions of the promoters if it is
kept up. Catson could afford to give
these lots to investors, and she would still
be largely the gainer.
HAS SIUAHTS SHASOSS
Why Carson Has Selected as the Scene of
th* Fight.
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 11.â Stuart bases
bis reasons for selecting Carson on tiie
ground that the accommodations are
ample and that the people wonted hard
to secure the passage of the glove-contest
bill and were therefore entitled to what
ever benefits might come from the big
crowd that will follow the fight. The
residents of Carson are beginning to wear
athletic sweaters instead of white shirts.
Major Hooper of the Occidental Hotel.
San Francisco, wired yesterday for
twenty-five front seats for the fight.
Sheriff Kinney received a dispatch from
a town in Ohio that 100 firemen wanted
seats at the ringside.
Some Eastern detectives arrived to-day
and arranged with the Sheriff to keep an
eye on the Eastern crooks which will visit
Carson next month. They bring photo
graphs of all the noted Eastern pick
pockets, and these pictures will be pub
lished and circulated to enable the public
to spot them. Corbett is billed to give a
sparring exhibition next Thursday even
ing at the opera-house. *
The Western Onion Company says they
can string extra wires from Reno to
handle the fight for $2500. ' 'â¢
FITZ IX PIKE FETTLE.
Just as Confident a* Erer That Me Will
Whtp Cnrbett.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 11. â Bob Fitzsim
mons and three men and two dogs ar
rived at the Grand Central station to
night on the Baltimore and Ohio train
from New York. The pugilist's manager,
Martin Julian, Dan H.ckey and Ernest
Reeber, with whom the Cornishman
train-, were of the party. A big and curi
ous crowd of men and boys were at the
depot to welcome Fitzsimmons. George
Silver, who is to referee the big fight in
Carson City, was also there to greet one of
tbe parties to the contest and have a talk
with Julian.
The representatives of the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad invited the party to
take a carriage and go to some sporting
resorts for refreshments until time to
board the 10 o'clock train on the Rock
Island road for Colorado, but Manager
Julian and Fitzsimmons declined with
thanks. ' They strolled leisurely over the
two blocks to the Van Bureu street depot,
! the Australian champion leading his does
to give them exercise. He was followed
by a gaping crowd and had to take refuge
in a baggage-car with his pets.
â¢ To a representative of the United As
sociated Presses Fitzsimmons said he was
feeling in fine condition, weighing about
179, and if he did not think he could whip
Corbett he would not have si ned articles.
He expects to arrive in Carson City next
Thursday, which would leave him a month
ot exclusive training at bis quarters all
he would want.
Martin Julian showed a big roll of bills,
amounting to $5000, which be explained
was the side bat for the fight. He an
nounced -that he would send the money
from Colorado Springs to Al Smith, the
stakeholder, in New York, explaining that
he did not pay over the money in New
York so as to - avoid any possible chance
of legal disturbance. He intends to co
right through to Carson and select the
training quarters. He has offers from
three' places. Fitzsimmons will make
three stops to give exhibitions â at Pueblo,
Colorado Springs and Leadville. Julian
said he, Hickey and Roe ber would be
behind Fitzsimmons in the ring.

Some of the Champion's Opinions on the Fight
and on Other Things â Win or Lose, He
Declares That This Will Be His
Last Battle.
| [Corbett arrived yesterday morning on
the overland, accompanied by his wife,
his brother Harry, who went to Nevada
to meet him, Jack McVey, bis trainer, and
one or two others.
He looked in first-class physical condi
tion as be greeted a number of bis friends
in Oakland. His eye was bright and clear,
bis skin healthful in tint, and the old
ng-y wrinkles that gave bim a dissipated
look on the occasion of his last visit here
have entirely disappeared. In motion he
was lithe and alert and in voice firm and
confident. : -
At Sixteenth-street station he was met
by bis father and mother, bis two broth
ers, Frank and Joe, and his little sister
Hazel. The greetings exchanged were
very affectionate, though his relatives
were so glad to see him that at first not
much was said on either side.
"How are yon, Jimmie boy exclaimed
the delighted father. "My, but you're
looking fine jX" X.XÂ£'S. .â 
"Oh, I'm in tiptop shape, dad," replied
the son. "You can't imagine how I've
been developing muscle lately. Why,
muscles have been making their existence
manifest in the last few months that I
never dreamed of having before."
Jim's lather nodded bis bead in high
approval. "That's just it," he said with
conviction. "That's perfectly true.
You're just like a fine-blooded racehorse.
It needs only a little training to put you
on your mettle."
On the way across the water to this City
the ladies went into the cabin, but Corbett
himself, surrounded by the gentlemen
who had met him in Oakland and others
who happened to be on the boat and knew
him, preferred standing on the deck out
side, where the salt air could be breathed
without restraint. He shook bands with
everybody in a hearty, genial fashion, and
in response to a query regarding his con
dition replied with a laugh: "By George,
it is astonishing how the first question
everybody seems to ask is about my con
dition. I must have been looking pretty
rocky when I left here, or else I cannot
account at all why this is so.
"Last night, to tell the truth, I didn't
get any sleep worth mentioning. It is
impossible to sleep when one comes to
San Francisco by way of Sacramento.
You're just, deep in slumber wben you
reach the capital, and there you're shaken
out of it so thoroughly that there is ab
solutely no use in trying to get another
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
I nap. You have to give up and read the
| papers or talk.
"But what's the use of making a fuss
over the loss of a little sleep," be added.
"This air is one of the best recuperators I
ever ran across."
Just then Corbett's eye happened to fall
upon his trainer, McVey, and his father,
i who were standing off to one side talking
jin subdued tones. He watched them a
minute and then laughed heartily, causing
both to turn their eyes in his direction.'
"Do you know?" he queried in under
tones, "that I can tell you exactly what
they're talking about? Well, lean. He's
wanting to know of McVey if I'm in
good shape to do 'im all right. Mac'll
brace bim up all right."
When the two drew near the main
group again Corbett asked his father if he
was satisfied things were as they should
be. Corbett Sr. apparently thought so,
for he just laid his hand affectionately on
his big son's shoulder and looked
confident.
"Tney gave you a great greeting in
Nevada, didn't they?" queried a member
of the party.
'Oh, yes; they're good people up there,"
was the answer.
"Things there are pretty slow, usually,
I guess, and they like anything to break
the monotony.
"I saw Governor Sadler, and took ad
vantage of the occasion to compliment
him for the stand he has taken in favor of
manly sport. The Governors of other
States are afraid of losing some votes.
While I was in Carson the Governor went
with me to look over my training quar
ters."
"They tell us," suggested one of his
brothers, with a sly wink to the crowd,
"that they laid you out in some of the
handball games you played on your way
West" " â¢
"Who in thunder said that?" blurted
the champion indignantly. "Why, from
the time I left New York I have done
up every man I met, the crack players of
every city at which we stopped. They put
their champion against me in St. Louis,
and when he got teat they claimed that it
was because we used a soft instead of a
hard ball. I invited him to try it again
with a hard ball, and though I wasn't used
to it, I did him up worse than ever."
Everybody laughed. Then Corbett saw
the point and laughed as well. About
this time the boat drew into tbe slip.
When the party landed Corbett elbowed
his way through the crowd, stopping here
and there to shake hands with a friend,
and led his mother, wife and sister to a
carriage in waiting. Stepping in himself
they were driven to the St. Nicholas Hotel.
The remainder of the party followed on
the cable-cars.
At the hotel Corbett changed his travel
ing suit for one of a mixed gray tweed,
and donned a milk-white sweater. He
will stay at the hotel until he leaves for
Nevada Monday evening. In the after
noon he walked downtown in company
with his brothers Joe and Frank to his
brother Harry's poolrooms on Ellis street.
Here a great crowd was waiting to re
ceive him, and he spent some time in
shaking hands and answering queries.
Harry Corbett's Scotch collie. Laddie, sim
ply fell in love with Jim, who took great
delight in tantalizing him by bouncing a
rubber ball and keeping it out of the dog's
reach. Even when he went into a rear
room for an interview the dog followed in
few minutes, having spent the interim in
searching for him, and lay down at his
feet. mi% i
"How do I feel? Well, candidly, I feel
j as strong as I ever felt in my life,'' said
J Corbett in answer to the oft-repeated
i question, as a smile lit up his counte
nance. "I do not intend to remain in this
City long, as I bad a little experience in
I Carson while I was there tbat gave me to
j understand that a man must be thor
| oughly acclimated to the high altitude if
! he hopes to engage successfully in any
I athletic competition.
"You see, I had a little try-out, by way
j of experience, with one of my trainers,
j and don't you kr.ow the effect was sur
prising. I was puffing like a good fellow
after each round, and it was no easy task
for me to catch my wind.
"The air is very light and the least ex
ertion will tell on a stranger to the moun
tain atmosphere. They tell me that after
I am a week or so in Carson I will get
along all right, and that I can engage in
heavy exercise without feeling in the least
bit fatigued. You know I have taken the
best of care of myself since my last visit2

to this City. I had a little experience
then which taught me a lesson that I am
not liable to forget in a hurry. When I
journeyed East after that Sharkey affair I
never missed an opportunity to take a lit
tle practice, either at bag-punching, play
ing handball â whicn is my favorite game,
of courseâ wrestling and boxing. 1 have
also been careful as to what went into my
stomach. I did not eat everything that
looked tempting, by a long shot. In fact,
I used particular care to eat nothing that I
thought would annoy the inner man, but
I am surprised at the result.
"I am feeling now as strong as the day
1 met Sullivan, and, if everything goes
all right with me in the mountains, I will
make that fellow who said 1 have been
trying to avoid a meeting with him wish
that he had never seen Jim Corbett. But
what's the use in talking. Time will tell
who is the better man, and after the bat
tle the people who have been reading thS
newspaper reports can then form an opin
ion which will be lasting. I shall say no
more about Fitzsimmons until I meet
him in the ring.
"You can say, however, that, win or
lose, this will be my last battle. Of course,
I expect to win. I don't care a fig about
the championship. They can all get in
and light for it after I get through with
Fitzsimmons. I know he is a dangerous
man and can hit a powerful blow, Dut I
do not propose to enter that ring for the
purpose of allowing Fitzsimmons or any
other man to make a target of my head.
What would my science be worth to me if
Fitzsimmons could land as he pleased? I
expect to get hit, but I also expect to get
away from blows that are considered
dangerous."
"How about that mucb-talked-of side
bet between you and Fitzsimmons?" was
asked.
"Well, my money is tin in Al Smith's
hand and all he has to do is to cover it.
1 have not heard ofa cent being put up by
either Fitzsimmons er Julian. To "tell
you the truth, I do not propose to force
the issue, as he might crawl out of a
meeting. I shall put no stumbling-block
in his way. If he or any of his friends
want to make a side bet. all well and
good. I will meet any amount of coin
Fitzsimmons will put up on the side, and
that's all I can say about that part of the
arrangements.
"Yes, I have selected Shaw's Springs as
my training station. It is a nice location,
within easy reach of Carson City. Billy

Billy Delaney will look after my inter
ests. They are all good fellows and we
will get along splendidly. If I can arrange
with Jeffries, the Los Angeles heavy
weight, to come to Carson after his go
with Stelzner I will have him spar with
me. He is a big husky fellow, and I think
he will make a good man after he has had
some experience. From what I under-
Matid from some of the boys this fellow
Jeffries is a very promising fellow.
"Where will Fitzsimmons train? Well,
I guess he will train at Steamboat Springs,
which is about twenty miles from Carson.
His affairs do not interest me any. I
hope, though, that he will be in fine con
dition when I meet him in the ring, as
there is no honor in whipping a sick man.
CHAMPION JAMES J. CORBETT as He Appeared on. His Arrival in Town Yesterday. He
Was Smiling and Happy and to All External Appearances in the Best of Health.
| Anyhow, he must be in good fix, as the
! rules read that the contestants must be
j physically in first-class condition on the
day of the fight."
Corbett weighs about 185 pounds now,
' and as be is as hard as nails he expects to
j enter the ring weighing 180 pounds.
He will play handball to-day at the
| Olympic Club against Jim Nealon, Jack
i Bonnet and Billy Kennedy. Corbett may
j possibly engage Jack Riordan, who is the
j champion handball-player of the coast, to
; play bali with him in Carson, where a
j court is now being constructed for the
! champion at a cost of $500.
Tuesday night Corbett will give a boxing
I exhibition in Reno. Wednesday night
j the sporting men of Virginia City will
have a chance to see him spar. Thursday
evening he will give an exhibition at
j Carson City, and then he will turn his at
! tention tothe work of hard training.
PUGILISTIC CARFARE.
Southern Pacific In No Hurry to
Fix the Rate to Nevada.
There are indications that Dan Stuart
and his lieutenant, Mr. Wheelock, re
| turned to Nevada last Wednesday without
! a final and satisfactory interview with
I Gene Passenger Agent T. H. Goodman
of the Southern Pacific concerning a round
' trip excursion rate to the city which will
j be the scene of the Corbett-Fitzsimmons
| battle.
In fact Mr. Goodman stated yesterday
| that no final figures had been determined
! upon. He said further:
''There is no need of hurry in fixing
upon the local rate. The pugilistic con
test will not take place for several weeks.
No Eastern rates have been determined
on at least none that we have heard of.
We would like to know what the rate is to
be from the East."
From this it is considered probable that
j no local fare to the fight will be made till
I the rate irom the principal Eastern points
i are made public. A rate may be made
that will be an inducement to Eastern
i pupilits to come on to the coast to re-
J cuperate from their financial losses or cir
culate their winnings in California.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1897.
the Grand Jury and explain his relations
with the insolvency proceedings of Meyer
Livingston, who swore that he was made
insolvent by being robbed of $3300, but
when asked about the particulars or the
alleged robbery was not at>le to give a sat
isfactory account of the affair.
Because Livingston could not tel! any
thing specific about the circumstances of
the supposed robbery, not remembering
whether the money alleged to have been
stolen was in a green bag, a blue bag, a
buckskin purse, a canvas sack or an old
stocking, he was arrested on a charge of
perjury.
The jury which tried Livingston was
not able to agree, and immediatÂ»ly after
the close of Livingston's trial Judge Wal
lace caused the arrest of Asher, who had
been Livingston's attorney in the insol
vency proceedings in Judge Slack's court.

NO COMPENSATION FOR IVORY.
English Statesmen Declare That It Would
Be Contrary to Precedent to
Reimburse Him.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 11.â In the House
of Commons to-day Patrick O'Brien, Par
nellite member for Kilkenny City, asked
the Government whether it was the in
tention to compensate Edward J. Ivory,
the alleged Irish- American dynamite
conspirator, the proceedings against
whom were recently dropped by the Gov
ernment for want of evidence, for his im
prisonment pending tbe trial and the ex
pense of defending himself against the
Government's unsupported charges.
Rght Hon. Arthur J. Balfour, First
Lord of the Treasury and the Government
leader in the House, replied that no com
munication had been received by the Gov
ernment from Ivory or any one in his be
half in regard to compensation, and that
the Home Secretary had informed him
that it would b? contrary to established
practice to admit any claim lor compensa
tion in such a case.
Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain, Sec
retary of Slate for the Colonies, reply
ing to a question by John W. Laurie,
Conservative member of the Pembrooko
and Haverford-West District, said he be
lieved that the Dominion of Canada was
disposed to contribute to the coÂ«t of a line
of cable communicating between Bermuda
and Jamaica, but he was not awate that
Canada had offered the sum of Â£3000 to
that object, as Mr. Kurch had suggested
in his inquiry. However, he added, there
were several difficulties in the way of the
construction of such a cable, which Great
Britain had not yet surmounted.

CRITICISM FOR THE SEX ATE.
Morgan on a Diplomatic Appropriation'
for a Xetti Republic.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 11.â
diplomatic and consular appropriation
bill, carrying an aggregate of $1 ,695,308, s
was passed after some caustic remarks by
Morgan of Alabama on an item of $10,000
for a Minister Plenipotentiary to the
States of Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Salva
dor. Two of these States, he said, had,
according to newspaper reports, formed
with Honduras a new Government, called
the Greater Republic of Central America,
sending a Minister to Washington who
had been formally received by the Presi
dent, and closing their respective Foreign
Offices, so that an American Minister
could hold no diplomatic relations with
them individually, but of this change the
President of the United States had. not
condescended to give any information to
Congress or the people.
Morgan spoke of this state of affairs as
having brought about a very awkward
complication, but be said that he had no
proposition to make about it. :
Neither had Hale (R.) of Maine, who
was in charge of the bill and who recog
nized the force of Morgan's observations,
but said that the Committee on Appro
priations had thought it better to leave
the item in the bill and let the State De
partment arrange the difficulty in the
way that might seem best to it.
An agreement was reached to have the
vote on the conference report to the im
migration bill taken up at 4 p. m. next
Wednesday.
At 1:30 o'clock the Senate went into ex
ecutive session on the arbitration treaty,
and contained to sit with closed doors
until 4:45 p. m., when it adjourned.
THE HOUSE AXD A SEMICOZOX.
Contested Election* Committee Reported
Against flatten of Georgia.
WASHINGTON, D. C, . Feb. 11.â A I
displaced semicolon in the bill providing
for the refunding of the bonded indebted
ness of the several Territories was tbe in
nocent cause of a wholly unexpected de
bate on the monetary question in the
House to-day, lasting two or three hours.
Two or three years ago Congress author
ized Arizona to sell some "gold" bonds,
upon the request of M. A. Smith, then the
delegate from that Territory, because the
Territory could get better terms for such
bonds than for "lawful-money" bonds.
Tbe bill under discussion authorized the
refunding of these particular bonds in
gold bonds, but the presence of a semi
colon in the text snegested to the mind of
McMillin (D.) of Tennessee tbe possibility
that the bill could be so construed as to
warrant the issue ot gold bonds for all the
bonds mentioned. From Payne's (it.) of
HWm'Mi imn > ni^Jiiii ii in* <wi ii mil ii mi
New York declaration that he could see
no harm that would result if all the bonds
were made-payable in gold a lively dis
cussion sprang up in which many mem
bers took part and which took a wide
ranee.
The most important statements in the
course of the debate were those of Knox
(D.) of Massachusetts, in charge of the
bill, that the country was upon a gold
basis and that it would doubtless continue
on that basis; tnat it would not initiate
any international bimetallic conference,
and that there was sufficient -statesman
ship in the Republic in party to provide
for the largest possible use of silver, and
that it would not be through the unlim
ited coinage of that metal.
At Knox's suggestion the semicolon was
replaced by a comma.
On McMillin's suggestion, the bonds,
other than the Arizona gold bonds named,
were made "lawful money of the United
States," and the bill was then passed.
The sundry civil appropriation bill for
the year ending June 30, 1898, was re
ported by Cannon (R.) of Illinois and
placed on the calendar.
Bartlett (D.) of Georgia presented the
unanimous report of Elections Committee
1 upon the contest of Thomas E. Watson
vs. J. C. Black from the Tenth District of
Georgia in lavor of Black, and said that
he would call it up at the first oppor
tunity.
The bill making appropriations for forti
fications lor the year ending June 30, 1898,
was considered and passed.
The postoffice appropriation bill was
taken up in committee of the whole and
discussed for an hour without action.
After the reading of the journal the
House went in committee or the whole,
Hull (R. of lowa in the chair, to consider
the fortifications appropriations bill. The
provisions of the bill were explained at
length by Hayne(R.)of Nebraska, alter
which the committee rose temporarily and
Cannon (R.) of Illinois reported the sun
dry civil appropriation bill, which was
completed this morning, and it was, with
out amendment, passed.
Knox (R.) of Massachusetts called up
the bill authorizing the funding of the
debts of the Territories.
The House went into committee of the
whole on the postoffice bill. The bill car
ries an appropriation of $95,600,000, an in
crease over the appropriation for the cur
rent year of $3,000,000.
In answer to questions by members.
Loud said there was, in his opinion, many
avenues through which tho expenditures
of the department could be largely re
duced, notably in the distribution of sec
ond-class mail matter, and in the rates
paid to the railroads for the transporta
tion of mail matter.
Bromwell (R.) of Pennsylvania said
that, as a member of the committee which
prepared the bill, he could not approve
the appropriation of $196,000 for special
facilities on trunk lines from Boston to
New Orleans. It was a pure gratuity, he
said, and while it was true that the ex
penditure was within the discretion of
the Postmaster-General, he doubted if
any man in the United States could or
would resist the pressure brought for the
disbursing of the appropriation after it
had bsen authorized by Congress.
The appropriation was detenaed by
Swanson (I).) of Pennsylvania.
The House then at 5:10 p. M. adjourned.
WOOL INTERESTS DISAGREE.
The Conference ot .he Big Associations
Ended in lirecracilable Differences
on High Tariffs.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 11â The
National Wool-Growers' Association and
the National As*ociation ol Wool Manu
facturers have split on the wool schedule
that each favor.--.
The conference has been in session here
almost continuously for the past two
days behind closed doors. An effort was
made to reach an agreement as to the
rates of duty on wool, which might be rec
ommended to the House Ways aud Means
Committee.
'"â¢" 8. D. N. North, secretary of the National
Association of Wool Manufacturers,
speaking of the disagreement, said: ''The
conference was entirely friendly at every
stage, but it ended in complete disagree
ment, due to irreconcilable differences of
opinion as to what a reasonable rate of
duty on wool is, under present condi
tions, and with a view to permanent tariff
laws.
Tbo manufacturers' committee, at the
request of the wool-growers, finally sub
mitted a schedule of rates which they
would join in recommending for the sake
of securing harmonious co-operation.
This schedule was higher than the judg
ment of the manufacturers approved, but
it was tendered as an evidence of their
kindly feeling toward the wool-growers
and of their willingness to concede to the
latter even higher rates of duty upon the
raw material than they ask or expect upon
their own manufactured products.
They proposed a duty of 8 cents a pound
on wools of class 1, under 16 cents a pound
in value, and 10 cents a pound over that
value, with double and triple duti-son
washed and scoured wools, and 11 cents a
pound on class 2 wools, with the same
dividing line of value, and upou carpet
wools lhe McKinley law rate-, namely:
Thirty-two per cent under 13 cents "in
value and 50 per cent over that value and
without a sorting clause. This proposi
tion would have given the wool-growers a
higher protection upon merino wools, so
far as the ad valorem equivalent is con
cerned, than they have ever had under
any tariff law.
"The wool-growers after a protracted
session passed a resolution rejecting this
proposition In all its parts, and stating
that they 'find it impossible to agree to
the schedule proposed in justice to the
absolute necessities of the wool-growers.' "
Before separating the wool-growers were
asked to name tne very lowest rates ol*
duty they were willing to accept in return
for the support of the manufacturers, and
they authorized Jud-e Lawrence to sub
mit the following schedule as their ulti
matum : Twelve cents a pound on class 1
and class 2 wools, double duty on washed
and triple duty on scoured, eight cents a
pound on all carpet wools, and double and
double and triple duties on washed and
scoured, and eight cents a pound addi
tional duty on all skirted wools.
. This is the original Lawrence schedule
with some slight modifications, and its
disastrous effects upon wool manufacture
and carpet manufacture are obvious to all
manufacturers. There were members of
the wool-growers' committee who recog
nized the impossibility of acquiescence in
such extreme rates; but the appointment
et a committee of conference had been
plac-d iv the hands of Judge Lawrence,
and he so constituted the committee that
it was ironclad against material deviation
from the tariff programme which he had
been advocating, notwithstanding the fact
that the manufacturers have evidence
which leads them to believe that a ma
jority o. the wool-growers of the country,
and particularly of the far West, believe
that their best interests will be promoted
by much more moderate duties.
THE IROX AAD STEEL SCHEDULE.
Foreign Lead Ores * Admitted- to Bond
and McKinley Rates I tared. '"
WASHINGTON, D.0., Feb. 11.â A fur
ther consideration of the iron and steel
schedule was bad this morning by the Re
publican members of the Ways and
Menus Committee. The chairman laid
before the members a letter from the
Treasury Department, suggesting tnat a
provision be inserted in the new bill per
mitting ores containing lead to enter the
country in bond and to be assayed at the
nearest assay office to tbe point of destina
tion, instead of collecting the duty at the
port of entry. The suggestion was adopted
and the duty was fixed at 1% cents per
pound.
The committee next turned its attention
to a number of minor matters in the
schedule upon which an ad valorem duty
is now levied. y-. These include cut nails
and cut spikes of iron or steel ; horseshoe
nails, wire nails, spikes, nuts, washers and
horse, mule and ox shoes; cut tacks, brads
or sprigs of all kinds, knitting and sew
dTan-jii mitmtxuiimrmmiwmw \ imiln Inm imÂ«n II

tape needles and all other needles; en
graved steel plates, stereotype and electro
type plates and engraved or lithographed
plates; railway fish plates, iron and steel
rivets, crosscut saws, wood screws, um
brella and parasol ribs, wheels for railroad
purposes, and ingots, cogced ingots,
blooms or blanks for the same. Upon all
of the foregoing the rate was made specific
ani substantially the same duty was im
posed as now exists.
The several paragraphs relating to cop
per, cod and silver were restore 1 to the
McKinley rates. Copper in rolled plates,
called brazier's copper, sheet!", rods, pipes
and copper bottoms, also sheathing of
yellow metal, of wnich copper is the com
ponent of chief value, and not composed
wholly or in part oi iron ungalvanized, 25
per cent ad valorem. Gold and silver
bullions and metal threads of gold, silver
or other metals not specially provided for,
3 Oper cent ad valorem.
PACIFIC ROADS' DEBT.
Propositions Withdrawn and the House
Committee Favors Settlement by
a Cabinet Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 11.â At the
meeting of the House Committee on Pa
cific Railroads to-day it was developod
that expected support forthe propositions
reported to have been made by Hubbard
of Mississippi relating to the settlement
of the Government had not been secured,
and tliey could not, therefore, be longer
considered within the category of possi
bilities. One of these was that a New
York capitalist, described as one "com
manding the largest amount of spot cash
available by any man in the United
States," would assume the Government
claim in full at 2 per cent and allow 5 per
cent of the gross earnings of the road to be
set aside as a sinking funding to pay ofl
the indebtedness. This gentleman, Hub
bard said, did not now desire to carry out
the terms of the proposition. .* â¢
The other was that the railroads run
ning to the Mississippi River at Kansas
City, Omaha and Sioux City would join in
a guarantee of the Government's claim
and jointly operate the road. Officers of
two of the roads had declared this to be
impracticable.
The committee ordered a favorable re
port upon Harrison's bill providing for a
settlement of the road's indebtedness by a
Cabinet meeting.

The first step is to build up the digestive or-
gans and restore tnem to their natural condi-
tion. This cannot be done by animal and
vegetable pepsins. The secretory glands of
the stomacn and intestines must be made to 1
do thtir work. Artificial digestions and pre-/
digested foods are of only temporary value
because the digestive organs under their use'
become . torpid. The Kiectro -Medical treat-
ment, administered only at the State Electro-
Medical Inst tute, acts as a stimulant to the
digestive organs and causes them to throw off
Nature's own digestives, which soon remove
all evidences of lack of nutrition." A treat-
ment must be given which will cause proper
assimilation of food to produce a pure blood
supply.

Considered by the Senate Com
mittee on Education and
Approved.
Present Ho'dcrs of Grammar and
Primary Certificates Not to Pass
New Examinations.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Feb. 11.â Teach- j
ers throughout the State, and particularly |
in San Francisco, have been much wrought |
up over a measure before the Legislature |
relative to teachers' certificates. This
measure provides for tbe issuance of ele- |
mentary certificates, a new designation :
lor those which give the holder the right |
to teach either primary or erammar :
grades.
The apprehension of the present holders j
of primary and grammar certificates was
due to the fact that they believed they
would have to secure one of tne new cer- I
tificates and so be compelled to undergo a j
new examination.
This, however, is not the case. All the j
holders of primary or grammar certificates '
st the expiration of the required period of i
experience will be granted life diplomas
in their respective classes, and none of the j
present rights or privileges of certificate j
holders will be in any way interfered with.
This afternoon the Senate Committee on
Education considered the bill and gave a
hearing to the committee representing the
ban Francisco teachers, comprising Su
perintendent Babcock, Messrs. O'Connor
and Lyser and School Directors Waller,
Drucker and Burns. The bill was dis
cussed in detail, and met with the full
approval of the visitors from Saa Fran
cisco.
Among other things it providas that
teachers' certificates issued by the School
Board of one county shall be good in every
other county of the State. The committee
decided to recommend the passage of the
bill.

OUTSIDt. J JUST VUMPAXIES.
A Declnion fVhich Practically shuts
Them Out of Illlnolm.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 11.-The Appel
late Court of the State of Illinois has af
firmed the decree of the Superior Court of
Cook County removing the Farmsrs' Loan
and Trust Company from the position of
co-trustee of the Lake-street Elevated
Road first mortgage, and in doing so it has
rendered a decision of the greatest im
portance both to local trnst companies and
the trust companies of other States doing
business in this State.
The Superior Court some time ago re
moved the Farmers' Loan and Trust Com
pany as trustee under the Lake-street
mortgage, and the New York Trust Com
pany appealed the case.
Justice Waterman of the Appellate
Court has now delivered a decision, Pre
siding Justice Hard and Justice Gary con
curring, which not only affirms the de
cree removing the Farmers' Loan and
Trust Company, but which will act to
prevent trust companies organized in
other States from accepting trusteeships
in this State and will force a' rearrange
ment of many trusteeships under mort
gages already in force.
The decision holds that an outside trust
company must deposit $203,000 with the Il
linois State Auditor in the same man " c
as Illinois trust companies are compelled
to do. and failure to do that makes them
liable to removal. The Eastern trust com
panies are not likely to comply with this
rulinz. They declare if they sbould de
posit $200,000 with the State Auditor of Il
linois half the other States in the Union
would pass laws compelling them to make
similar deposits, and that would be im
practicable. _

W. H. Elliott and Theodore Roosevelt
Want ihe Assistant Secretaryship
of the Navy. *
CANTON, Ohio. Feb. 11.â Major McKin
ley shook hands with four scort or more
of visitors to-day and found time to reply
to a number of letters and talk to an old
friend or two.
W. H. Elliott, a newspaperman of New
castle, Ind., who was formerly in the navy
and is a graduate or the United Slates
Naval Academy, called to present his ap
plication for Assistant Secretary of the
Navy. Mr. Elliott is indorsed by many
prominent men of his own and other
States. The President-elect gave him a
careful hearing and asked him to confer
with ex-Governor John D. Long of Massa
chusetts about the matter, which seems
to prove very conclusively that, as these
dispatches have announced, Mr. Long has
been definitely settled upon for the po
sition of Secretary of the Navy. It was
also learned by Mr. Elliott that Theodore
Roosevelt is a candidate for the position
of Assistant Secretary of the Navy and
that no promises have been made to him.
General Andrew llickenlooper of Cin
cinnati was a caller at the McKinley resi
dence this afternoon. He is of the opin
ion that a friendly conference among
those concerned will practically settle the
question of Mr. Sherman's successor in
the Senate of the United States.
Among other callers were M. E. Furner,
Charles L. Stone and William A. Jones,

NEW YORK, N.Y., Feb. 11.â Captain !
Philo H. McGiffin, formerly an officer of j
the Chinese navy and commander of!
the battle-ship Chin Yuen in the battle !
of the Yalu, committed suicide this morn- |
ing at the Post Graduate Hospital by j
shooting.
Captain McGiffin had been in the hos
pital for a month under treatment for
nervous protration. He retired at 10
o'clock last night. His nurse, named Bar
rett, saw no hing unusual. At 2 o'clock
this morning Barrett was starled by a
pistol shot. Ha hastened to Captain Mc-
Giffin's apartment and found the patient
sitting bolstered up iv bed dead. A
hastily penciled note, addressed to the
hospital authorities, expressing gratitude
for kindnesses to the writer, was found,
but it gave no reason for the action.
Captain McGiffin, formerly an officer in
the American navy, resigned to accept
service under the Chinese Emperor.
Captain McGiffin was in command of
the Chinese warship Chen Yuen during
the battle of the Yalu, September 17, 1894.
and though he fought her well and bravely
was compelled to retire. The injuries re
ceived iv that fight, not regarded at the
time as especially serious, completely
shattered his health and he has been an
invalid ever since. A few months ago his
mind gave way and he was committed to
an insane asylum.
QUE EX LIZ'S ORIPPE SETTEE.
Xous Believed She In in Waehington for
Â« Political Purpose.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 11.â A Sun's
special from Washington says: Liliuoka
lani, the deposed Queen of Hawaii, who j
has been suffering with the grippe for the j
past few days, is now convalescent. She
is feeling better than for six days previ- !
ous. To-day, if the weather permits and j
she is in good spirits, the Capitol will be j
visited. For the past ten days her Majesty I
has been planning to see the building |
where our laws are made and to seethe
people who make them, but for one rea
son or another she has failed to carry out
her purpose.
The usual number of callers came to see ,
her yesterday. It is surprising to see
what an interest the people of the country i
have in this woman. Not a day passes i
that she does not receive at least a dozen
invitations to attend social functions, but
she has not as yet accepted any of them.
As the days pass and no sign of her quit
ting the capital city appears the belief
grows that she is here for a political pur
pose, but just what it is no one seems to
know. Tho talk most indulged in last
night was that she is trying to secure as
sistance from the present or incoming ad
ministration to place her on the Hawaiian i
throne.

MILWAUKEE. Wis., Feb. 11. â The
Wisconsin Odd Fellows' Mutual Insurance
Company, which was organized in 1863,
made an assignment to-day for the benefit
of its creditors, and John L. Fulton of
Whitewater, Wis., is now in charge of the
company's affairs as receiver at the gen
eral offices in this city. During the past
year over 5003 members have dropped out,
it is said, which crippled the company so
it could not pay its losses. The aggregate
insurance due from the Odd Fellows' Mu
tual Company is $60,000. Under the as
signmem steps will be taken to collect
from ex-members who have refused to
settle, and the assets, it is believed, will
be increased so tbat 75. per cent may be
paid in time.
THE SAN FKAyCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1897.
MAY YET PASS
OVER THE VETO
Assemblymen Discuss the
Bill to Provide Funds
for the Printer.
It Claimed That There Is Not
a Deficiency in the
O.fice.
Lively Debates ln an Attempt to
Override th 3 Will of Gov
ernor Bald.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 11.â Really
the sessions of the Assembly are becom
ing interesting. The members have been
jolted out of the commonplace rut of dull
routine and are showing signs of life.
Yesterday there was the Duckworth
matinee, followed this morning by a lively
skirmish over the passage of the $300,000
dredger bill, and this afternoon by the
joust between Governor Budd and the
State Printer. It was not quite so excit
ing as the baiting of Clerk Duckworth on
the day before, but it Was equally as in
teresting and was witnessed by a crowd
equally as larpe, all the printers and lead
ing representatives of the Federated
Trades, and all the pretty girls and some
of the homely ones, too, from the State
Book Bindery being present in all the
glory of their war paint and feathers.
The friends of Governor Budd achieved
a temporary victory by preventing a two
thirds vote to pass the State Printer's ap
propriation of $75,000 over the veto, but
Leavitt's motion to reconsider will start
the ball rolling again to-morrow after
noon. The matter was decided by a vote
of 47 ayes to 31 noes, Keables and Lands-
borough (Fusionists) voting with tbe Re
publicans in favor of the appropriation
and Belshaw (R.) absent. With the two
exceptions just noted the Democrats voted
solidly to sustain the Governor.
It was a most extraordinary affair all
around. The minority conceded, or rather
did not deny, that the appropriation was
necessary to carry on the State printing
office up to July 1, nor did they deny that
mnch larger sums had been allowed other
State printers for a similar period in past
years, but because Governor Budd had
' vetoed the bill they were bound to stand
j by him right or wrong.
As an evidence of the weakness of the
minority, it was stated in the course of
the debate that tbe friends of the Gover
nor had expressed their willingness, and
his, to allow the State Printer $40,000,
with the understanding that if that sum
should, before the close of the session, be
found inadequate, a deficiency bill lor the
i remaining $35,000 could be rushed through.
J It seemed as though the Democrats were
! looking for a soft spot on which to fall,
j but all their overtures were spurned. The
â  cry of the Republican* was "No compro
mise!" while the Democrats sought to
j justify their course by alleging a dis
j crepancy between the accounts of the
j State Printer and the vouchers allowed by
| the State Board of Examiners. It was ar
gued by the majority that the printer did
not have the handling of a dollar of the
State's money; that the State Board of
Examiners passed upon the payrolls and
all other claims against the printing
I office; that the printer's vouchers were
j correct and in possession of the Board of
i Examiners, and that in order to be hon
! est, straightforward and fair in the matter
it would be necessary for the minority to
! show that the proposed appropriation of
$75,000 was too large, or that no part of it
whatever was necessary, and that the
I charge of the existence of a discrepancy
! was immaterial and not relevant to the
j issue before the House.
That cood man from Amador, Cami
; netti, who, like a political Cincinnati, on
j leaving his toga behind him in the halls
I of Congress, has returned to the humble
| plow of the Assembly, led the forces of
: the Governor. His argument was almost
i exclusively confined to the matter of the
alleged discrepancy, and he ignored the
real issue of the need of the appropria
tion. But, after all, '.he good man fell into
a trap which took all the fizz out of him,
and left him stale, fiat and unprofitable.
Alter he had defied the friends of the
bill to deny that there was a discrepancy,
and after he had said that he would take
; the word of the bookkeeper of the State
I Printing Office rather than that of Leavitt
of Alameda, Leavitt stated that the
! figures which he (Leavitt) had quoted to
show that not only no discrepancy ex
isted, but that on the contrary there
should be $2000 tothe credit of the State
Printer, had been furnished . im by the
bookkeeper ol the State Printer.
Shanahan, Caminetti's lieutenant, was
also given an unexpected setback and bad
the laugh turned ou him. He was dis
claiming against waste and extravagance
and harping on the imaginary dis
crepancy, when Dennery. asked him
whether it was not true that he (Shana
han) had not several years ago voted for
an appropriation of $70,000 at this time of
tbe year for a deficiency in the State
Printing Office, the Superintendent of
which was a D mocrat. That was before
the greater number of the present bureaus
and commissions were created and when
the quantity of printing required was
very much less than it is to-day.
\Vhen tne matter was placed before the
House this afternoon Meiici:, chairman of
the Retrenchment Committee, presented
a report stating what the committee had
done in the matter iÂ»nd citing the fact that
the Governor bad refused to obey the
subpena of the committee. The report re
cited that the committee bad discovered
an apparent irregularity, and that the ex
isting method of publishing State docu
ments tended to the unnecessary expendi
ture of State money, a condition for which
the Legislature itself was responsible, be
cause of its failure to enact the proper
laws regulating that matter. In view of
the fact that an additional appropriation
was needed to meet the work already in
band and accumulating in the hands of
the State Printer the committee recom
mended the appointment of one or more
experts to expert the accountsof the State
Printer and the apparent irregularity
already mentioned. accounts of the State
nd the apparent irregularity
Leavitt of Alameda opened the debate
on behalf of tbe bill with the proposition
that the question apparently hinged on an
irregularity in the accounts of the State
Primer. But the fact was that there was
no irregularity and no misappropriation
of the funds, "and," added Leavitt. "the
report itself does not show it, the Gover
nor to tbe contrary notwithstanding."
Leavitt went on to explain that an ap
propriation of $50,000 had been made for
the running expenses of the last sÂ°ssi not
the Legislature, but it spent $28,000 more
than that amount. The report of the State
Printer showed- that printing had been
done for the d iff rent departments of the
State government at a cost of $82,257 80;
that there was stock on hand at that time
of the value of $15,693 48. making an ag
gregate of $97,956 28 absolutely Accounted
for. Bearing in mind that the $28,008 that
was used aver and above the $50,000 was to
be paid out of the $250,000 appropriation
and deducting that irom $49,044 leaves
$21,036. The lithographin that was done
for the several departments cost $4538 and
deducted d -partments cost $4538 and
t deducted from $21,036 leaves but

paratus and machinery were purchased at
a cost of $6930. These things could not be
charged up to any of the departments of
the printing office; and deducting it from
$16,478, leaves $9523 of the so-called defi
ciency. Out ol that was to be taken $5048
for plumbing, etc., leaving $4480. Insur
ance at that time coula certainly "be

would make a further reduction of $1342.
The removal of the bindery materials,
etc., from the third to the second floor of
the building, by permission of the State
Board of Examiners, cost between . $4000
and $5000. This was cheaper than the
work could be done by contract. That
would leave a deficiency, not against, but
in favor of the State Printer of $2000.
Dennery of San Francisco expressed the
hope that the Assembly would not make a
political matter out of the affair. . It was
a question as to whether they wanted to
keep the State Printing Office open or
whether they wanted it closed.
"Do you want your business to be done
by the infamous booK ring of which we
have heard so much?" asked Dennery.
Then he told of a big mass-meeting of
woiklngraen, which he had attended last
night, and of the sentiment that was ex
pressed at that meeting in favor of the ap
propriation. He said that Mr. Severy had
been given a position in the State Print

Bridgford argued ihat whenever the
Governor exercised bis discretion and
vetoed a bill it was the duty of the Legis
lature to sustain him.
Melick said that the commission, after
having made a thorough investigation of
the matter, had found that the apropria
tion of $75,000 was actually needed to carry
the printing office through until July 1.
By next Saturday night $20,000 would be
required to ; pay up the wages now due.
While Shanahan was talking about the
amount that would be actually needed by
the Printer for the present, Dennery asked
him if he had not voted in 1389 in favor of
a deficiency appropriation of $70,000 for
State Printer Young, Democrat. "I did,"
replied Shanahan, and a shout of laughter
went up from the lobby.
Price of Sonoma said that he believed,
as had been well said at last night's labor
mass-meeting by the Senate chaplain, that
it was not a question of Democracy, Re

"If we indorse Buddism," he added, "we
indorse a greater number of holidays than
we dream of." He spoke of the primers
and book-binders who would be turned
out into tbe streets if the office should be
closed for lack of funds to run it. He be
lieved that the Governor had been misled
as to the statements in his message, not
maliciously, but ignorantly, and called at
tention to the misrepresentations in the
Governor's message as to the capacity of
the presses.
Caminetti followed with a statement
that the bookkeeper of the State Printer
had been unable to account for the dis
crepancy of $ 2,000, and asked why was it
that the bookkeeper, who surely should be
the best authority, could not give the com
mittee the same items as were read by
LÂ°avitt.
Leavitt replied that he had obtained the
| figures quoted by him from the book
; keeper himself. Caminetti attacked the
I leaders of the labor meeting held on the
evening previous and denounced them as
"agitators" and "demagogues." He ac
cused W. B. Thorp of having robbed the
State by drawing money for work that was
never nerlormed by him.

Honolulu, Feb. 2, 1897.
Statement of Mollie Sheldon before the At
torney-General.
Mrs. Dimond came out to see me lately, and
she asked me ii I had not been intimate with
her husband. She said that she had been told
by r.n intimate iriend of Mrs. Dimond's that I
had been intimate with her husbind, and that
during Mrs. Dimond's absence I had been out
and spent the night with him and was seen to
come away at 10 o'clock in the morning. She
spoke about it us if It was a fact ar.d there was
no use denying It, I said, "Mrs. Dimond, who
gave you tnat information?" She slopped and
looked at me and said, -' Were you never out
there?" I said "No." She asked me again,
and I said no, I did not know
the first thing about her place. She said
she was very much disappointed as she hoped
to have got some information, she was very
much disappointed and sue said: "Of course
I am not in a position to otter you anything,
but if you would help me in this now I would
make it worth your while." I said I was sorry,
but I could not do anything to help her.
When she was going down the steps she put
her hand on my shoulder and asked me to
think it over; that Mr. Dimond had put her in
such a position that she was forced to do what
she was doing. Any one helping her now
she was willing to pay $500 and even
would not stop at $1000, and asked
me if I knew any one who had
been with her husband ifl would not try to
find out something about her husband and
â he would pay me. She did not say how much.
She said: "Of course in a case like this, Mollie,
lt would seem your duty to help the woman
and not the man." I said: "It is a matter of
indifference to me. I am not going to help
either you or Mr. Dimond." She did not try
to make me admit that I had been intimate
with Mr. Dimond. When I denied it she
looked at me and said: "I wish you would tell
me the truth." She said: "I was in hopes
that 1 would be able to settle it in private with
you and not subpenayoulortbe trial, but now
lam afraid I will have to." She told me any
one helping her just now she was willing to
pay $500, but she said : "I would not even stop
at $1000." She did not thieaten me
in any way. When she first entered the room
she smiled ana said: "1 hope you know what
1 came for. lam sorry ; I did not want to get
you into trouble; I am sorry you happened to
be the one." She went on in that strain. I
asked her who gave her such information.
Afterward she told me it was Jim Brown. I
said: "I don't know how he could have told
voi such a thing. He nud I have not been
caking for a year." I knew that Mrs.
Dimond was com me to see me. She sent word
io my brother-in-law, David I'nauna, to ask
mo 1/ I would see her, and I said yes. Alter I
denied having improper relation with her
husband she did not insist that I had, but
commenced to speak of not being in a position
rt> offer me anything, but still, if 1 helped her,
she would make lt worth my while.

RLOCKAOE WORK liEGUX.
Target Practice J'reraiUd Jesterday Off
Charleston Harbor.
CHARLESTON, S. C, Feb. 11.âNoth
ing of much consequence has been done
by the war fleet during the day. About
noon the Amphitrite came up to the city
and anchored off the Custom-house pier,
where she still lies. An officer from the
New York cams up to town yesterday and
made contracts for coal for all the fleet,
and the Amphitrite will be the first one to
have her bunkers filled. Tne New York,
Maine,' Columbia and Marblebead lay
within a cable's length of one another to
day until nearly dark, and then they re
sumed their position of last nieht.
During the day they placed reets for
exercise of the secondary batteries, and
they practiced with these to-night with
the aid of their searchlights. The same
work was done last nigbt, and it is said
that during the practice to-night a seaman
on the Maine was injured, but the name
is not given and the report is not fully
substantiated.
1 1 is no longer a doubt that the fleet is
now actually engaged in its blockade
wort. The Vesuvius is looked for hourly,
and from unofficial sources on shipboard
it was learned that the Dolphin may re
turn to Charleston from Jacksonville as a
blockade-runner. Neither the Indiana
nor Massachusetts had joined the fleet late
this afternoon, though both are due here.
Captain Chester of the Newark arrived in
the city with his family durum the day,
and it is supposed that bis ship, which has
been coaling at Port Iloyal, will join him
to-morrow.

WAR OF THE RAIL GIANTS.
Inside Price Still Believed to Be $17
Per Ton and the Biggest Demand
Is Satisfied,
CHICAGO, 111., Feb 11.â The war of
the steel rail giants did not undergo any
change in this market to-day so far as the
selling price is concerned, but the hostile
lines were arrayed as strongly against each
other as on the first day of the week. The
fact is that the present necessities of pros
perous railroads in the steel rail line have
been satisfied in a large majority of cases
by the contracts recently made with the
Carnegie and Illinois Steel Companies.
The Carnegie price for steel rails any
where was to-day $17 a ton. At this
tempting figure the following orders have
been placed:
Twenty-five thousand tons to the Chi
cago. Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad;
â¢20,000 tons to the Atchison, Topeka and
Sauta Fe, and 1400 tons to the Chicago.
Hammond and Western.
President Gates of the Illinois Steel
Company left Chicago to-day for Pitts
burg. The object of bis trip is kept a
secret by other officers of the company
here, but considerable significance is at
tached to his ueparture by iron and steel
men in view of the fierce fight which is
being Waged in that industry. In his ab
sence Second Vice-President W. F. Palmer
said to a representative of the United As
sociated Presses:
"The Illinois Steel Company to-day
sold rails for $18 per ton. We understand
some of the Eastern mills have offered
them in this market at $17 per ton."
"Do you look for the dissolution of the
iron ore pool as a result of tbe rail and
billet pools going to pieces?''
"It is safe to say, speaking' generally,
thai tbere is no such, thing to-day as a
pool in the iron and steel business. We
have nothing to do with the ore pool."
Although $18 was the price "officially
given by the Illinois company for to-day,
the inside opinion is that what rails were
sold for to-day by the Western concern
were at the Carnegie price of $17. The
preference for placing orders witu the Illi
nois company would only be given by
Western roads when the price was cut to
the Carnegie quotation.
The lact tnat there is no agreement
among the companies operating the iron
mines in the Mesaba and Vermillion
ranges and in the Mahoning mine region,
covering the output of the mines or tbe
selling price lor 1897, is not regarded here
as proof that there will be no icon ore pool
this year. The agreement is not inane
until the time for lake navigation ap
proaches, when lake rates are hied, and
upon them are based tbe price of ore. it
is believed the big cut in t^ie finished prod
uct of the mines, which is likely, to re
main through the year, will have a ten
dency to disturb the market in the raw
material when the opportunity for a profit
able export business in the mill product,
in competition with English and Conti
nental mills, is taken into consideration.
WESTERS MRS IO SECEDE.
They Will Start a Seta Jurisdiction of
Renevnlent Rohemians.
OMAHA, Nebr., Feb. 11.â The West- â¢
crn conlerence ot lodges of the C. S. P. S., '
commonly known as the National Bo
hemian Benevolent Association, now in
session in this city, after deliberating for
two days on the differences pending be
tween the Western and Eastern lodges, ;
lias issued its ultimatum to the Supreme
Lodge. It provides that certain changes
in the lod<:e constitution and customs
must be made by July 1 or the Western
lodges will secede and organize a Western
jurisdiction. <
The principal change asked for is the
substitution of a framed insurance sys
tem for the present level system. As it
is now a man of ttie maximum age of 45
years pays no larger assessments for the
insurance benefits than the man of tbe
minimum age of 21. For a number of
years the West has lougnt for this, claim
ing that no new blood could be brought
into the lodges under existing conditions.
Having been turned down, tie West as
serted itself. As a sign that the confer
ence means business it has drafted a
constitution for a Western jurisdiction
embracing its needs and will. elect a full
corps of Supreme Lodge oflicers, Loth to
be contingent upon the rejection of the
ultimatum of the conference. Tbe pro
posed new jurisdiction includes the States
ot Wisconsin, Minnesota, the Dakota-,
lowa, Nebraska and several detached
lodges, and has about 2500 members.

were elected as the auditing committee
without opposition.
The election of officers was not reached
on the programme until late in the after
noon. When nominations for president
were declared in order W. E. Connelly of
Illinois said thai what he was to say was
in opposition to the wishes of his delega
tion, but he was there in the interests of
the L. A. W. He feelingly and eloquently
referred to the league's past and its future.
It was important that officers of the
soundest judgment be selected. He said
there was one man in the assembly that
met all requirements and stood above all
others. He continued in an impressive
tone and then presented the name of Isaac
B. Potter of New York as a candidate for
president. As the name escaped his lips a
tumult of applause resounded through the
hall.
William Kempton. chief consul of Ohio,
followed, and in a few brief remarks nom
inated Sterling Elliott amid great ap
plause. He said Mr. Elliott's record spoae
lor itself, and no nobler man could be
found for the office.

Miller of Massachusetts and Sheri
dan of Illinois seconded the nomination
of Elliott on behalf of their States. W. S.

York were appointed as tellers. A secret
ballot was taken. The secretary announced
the vote for president as follows: I. B.
Potter of New Yore 155, Sterling Elliott of
Boston 115, blank 1.
One vote more than the number of dels
gates was cast, and it was thougi t that
some one would question the validity of
the vote on this account, but no mention
was made of this fact. Sterling Elliott
moved to make Mr. Potter's election
unanimous, and this was carried. When
the result was announced three cheers
were given by the delegates lor President
elect Potter and retiring President Elliott.

and legislation was progressing on this
question in twelve States. He referred to
roads in European countries Where the
Government controls them. He urged all
wheelmen to use tbeir best efforts to se
cure this reform in their own States. He
said opposition from the farmers was due
to a luck of knowledge.
The transportation committee reported
that it bad found that the railroads bad
determined to fix a charge for carrying
bicycles. Efforts had been made in many
of the States to secure the passage of a
bill similar to tbe Armstrong bill in this
State, and the chairman had hopes of it
being adopted in all States except Ver
mont and Georgia, whÂ»re it had been de
feated. A numberof Western roads con
sented to carry bicycles- free. He ex
pected that in a short time all the trunk
lines will b* in line with the others.
George D. Gideon, chairman of the Na
tional Racing Board, was introduced amid
a storm of applause. He said the racing
season of 1890 was greater than ever be
fore. The board bat a great deal of diffi
culty in keeping the amatenr ranks from
abuse. There are 1396 professionals in the
country, and the sport was clean, having

Unable to Pay for Street Im

Forec osure Drives the Old Man Crazy
and Now H s Life-Partner Is
a Muniac
STOCKTON. Cal., Feb. 11.â A pitiful
sight was to be seen this afternoon at tbe
dwelling of David McLaughlin near tbe
loot of Main street. In the kitchen a
numberof ladies from the neighborhood
bad gathered round, and in their midst,
bald firmly by two persons, witb her back
upon their laps, lay gasping and strug
gbne an aged woman, who had become a
raving maniac from tha loss of her home,
which she and her husband were com
pelled to mortgage to pay for street im
provements, and which was taken away
from them a few months ago.
In the kitchen were two officers of the
law, and at tbe front gate a hack bad
drawn up waiting to take the poor woman
to tbe madhouse, while her husband had
preceded her, for be, too, was driven
insane by the loss of their home and was
committed to the asylum some two months
ago.
The McCues owned four lots at the
northwest corner of Channel and Aurora
streets, which was tbeir home place, and
four more "east of the railroad." The
husband made his living, byr means of a
horse and cart. He sold manure, and
they got along very frugally. Finally,
they were ordered to improve the streets
in front of their property, and to do so a
mortgage had to be clapped on the lots.
The interest could not be paid. The debt
grew larger and larger, and at last every
thing went.
Obliged to quit the spot which had been
their home for some thirty-five years, they
sought shelter elsewhere. The husband
soon found it in the madhouse, for he
went crazy brooding over bis loss. Mrs.
McCue obtained a new home at her
brother's house, but she could not help
worrying over tbe change in affairs.
Yesterday she grew worse and would go
out into the back yard and throw herself
onto the ground. Last night she sang
and danced and screamed ana stamped
with ber feet up and down the sidewalk
in front of the dwelling, and this morning
the same performance was repealed. Both
husband and wife are now in the asylum.

The object of the San Joseans' visit to
this city was to take a look at the new
street-roller. Agent Maggard has been in
San Jose trying to sell that city a roller
similar to the one he sold io Stockton, and
he suggested that the officials of that
place visit this city to look at the machine,
knowing that the Stockton street officials
would praise it.
San Jose is now making extensive
street improvements and the only rolier
that the city owns is a six-ton horse
machine. Ihis morning the San Jose
officials paid a visit to the Sheriff's mu
seum cf curios, being shown around by

also taken over recently macadamized
streets, and the roller was pointed out to

to rest all the time. My blood was dis

just for a moment, my head swam ; I was*
not the least bit dizzy. I knew my needs
and determined to use a bottle of Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. I easily procured
the first bottle, and after using for six days
felt better in every way. When I bought
the second bottle I had a little trouble in
getting it. The drug clerk tried to talk me
into using something else. I knew what I
wanted and insisted on getting Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. I am heartily
glad 1 bought the remedy and will gladly
recommend it to any one. Joy's is cer
tainly fine."
No druggist owns stock in Joy's Vege

Sorry Plight of the Crew
| of the Steamship
Victoria.
Development of Smallpox on the
â¢Vessel May Isolate Them
All Summer.
N w Cases Reported Daily Among
the Chinese Passengers, Causing
Great Alarm.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. ILâ
â¢ At the rate of development of smallpox
cases at Dimond Point station the past
two weeks, the crew of tho steamship
Victoria, running on the Puget Sound-
Orient route, is in a fair way to be re
tained by the United States quarantine
officials all summer.
Upon arrival of the vessel at Victoria
some weeks ago, she was subjected to a
thorough fumigation and the crew was
detained several days. They were then
sent across to this side in a special
.steamer, but Dr. Stimpson, United States
, quarantine ollicrr here, refused to permit
' tliem to join their vessel at Tacoma until
they Uad gone through two weeks of quar
'-. tine.
No case developed until the day prior
to the one on which they would have been
discharged, when smallpox symptoms ap
peared on one of the Celestials. This re
sulted in another quarantine of fourteen
days being declared. The time would
have expired 0:1 Saturday next, but this
morning Dr. Stimpson, in making his
rounds, found another case among the
sons of the Flowery Kingdom, as a conse
quence of which two weeks more will be
spent at the station. It is the opinion of
those conversant with the particulars that
more cases will develop from time to
time, in which event the prospects look
' fair to a summer isolation of not only
' tho patients, but the employes of the
station as well. The force includes
Keeper H. M. Hammond, Engineer Hank
Dewain, Attendant George Pint and seve
ral other well-known citizens of this city.
Ii I.R IMi SI. PATROL.
Uncle Sam Will Change His Tactics
This Tear.
PORT TOWNSEND. Wash., Feb. 11â It
is learned from a reliable source that the
.. make-up of the Bering Sea fleet this year
j will be radically different from any pre
vious year, the authorities appreciating
the ridiculousness of the joint patrol De
tween this country and Great Britain, in
which the major part of the work falls on
the shoulders of Uncle Sam.
Since the patrol was inaugurated this
Government has been called upon to per
form the greater part of the work. At
first a fleet of war vessels accompanied the
revenue cutters and assisted in the work
of keeping the sea free from pelagic seal
ers, there being at one time ten first-class
' American craft in the north, while one
â¢ an liquated old unsea worthy cunooat rep
resented Queen Victoria. Last season
tight revenue vessels patrolled the sea,
wnile one British vessel went north and
spent most of her time at Sitka, while the
oflicers went ashore on hunting ex pea i
â¢ tions.
. As a result of this it is said that next
year the United States will send but three
â  cutters to patrol the waters adjacent to
" the seal island- , the fleet to be made up of
'â¢ the Rush, Grant and Perry, leaving the
Bear free to look after the whaling sta
tion-. The start for the north will be
made from here early in May, the four
" vessels going in company.
PERIL VF THE MACK IS AW.
Still Aground and a Fierce Storm lt
Predicted.
.' PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. ILâ
There are uo development in regard to
"the steamship Mackinaw, which ran
ajÂ»r6und at Marrowstone Point early yes
terday morning, excepting that she is be
ing. buried deeper in the sands with every
motion of the water. The vessel is so
sprung as to prevent the use of the dis
"charging appliances aboard, and the deck
houses are opening up. The woric of dis
charging by hand is making little or no
showing on the vessel's draught, and it is
not probable that. she will' be ready for a
.pull by the lugs to-morrow, as was antici
pated. The barometer has fallen seven
tenths in the last twelve hours, and a
fierre storm is predicted for Puget Sound.
â In such event the fate of the Mackinaw is
. sealed beyond the possibility of a doubt.
TACOMA AGAIN EXCITED.
Mayor Orr Prefers Charges of Crooked
Conduct Against the Local Civil
Service Commission.
' TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 11.â Tacoma has
another municipal sensaiion.- Monday
night Mayor Orr startled the community
by preferring charges against tbe Civil
If Service Commission appointed last spring
â¢â¢by Mayor Fawcett, consisting of Governor
T Teat! and Richard Bond (fusionisis) and
â¢ FÂ» Sahm (Republican), alleging that the
"commission's examination last spring of
app'icantsfor city positions was conducted
unfairly and that favored applicants were
. given copies of the questions two weeks
beforehand.
The Council has appointed an investi
gating committee, which is holding daily
.sessions. George Sanderson, a light in
spector, testified to-day that two weeks
before last spring's examination John
To<id gave him answers to the questions
to be asked, tiling him to memorize them
* and pass them on to other applicants.
This Sanderson did. He says the ques
tions asked were the same as on Todd's
list. He answered all he could remem
ber, but avera.ed only 08, or 2 less than
necessary. Sanderson says Todd told him
he .would fix it, and later Sanderson was
informed that his average had been raised
to 83. . Todd was then a city lineman, and
now resides in San Francisco.
Thi.s is a sample of the evidence brought
out. It is believed by many that the
Council will oust ihe commission, which
w:ll enable Mayor Orr to appoint a new
'iiÂ». This will result in new examina
tions and in throwing out many employes
v.- ho were put to work under the Populist
commission.

SALEM, Or., Feb. ILâ Tbe joint As
ieembly was called to order at 12 noon.
r-The rolicall showed eleven Senators and
I twenty-six Representatives present, in all
thirty-seven. Representative Nos when
bis name was called, rose and said he was
here to do his duty and insisted that those
wbo did not were dishonest, but at the
same time a man had been elected when
he was not qualified and consequently
usurps his seat. Reed, a new convert
from the Senate, also answered to his
name and made a fiery speech, denounc
ing those who, would not recognize the
illegal organization. Reed remained out
thirty-two days and has only now discov
ered that the Benson House is not legally
organized. Like all new converts he was
unusually enthusiastic.
LOS ANGELES TALE OF WOE.
Pathetic Story of a Lovesick Swain, Who
Is Robbed and Jilted by the Girl
He Adores.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 11.â A for
lorn and lovesick swain, in the person of
Leon Mar'h of Oakland, unbosomed him
self to Chief Glass here to-day, telling a
pitiful story of how a heartless girl, after
getting possession of his valuables and
money, had jilted him and refused to re
store his effects. The fellow's lamenta
tions were very touching. It seems to
have been tbe first rude awakening of his
life In the line of fickleness in a young and
prepossessing lady. He said:
"I have often read accounts in the
pavers of men committing suicide because
they were disappointed in love, and I
always said they were big fools, but 1
came near taking my life last night on
account of being jilted by a tall and hand
some blonde.''
Young Marsh had a good position with
Dr. Clark, superintendent of an Oakland
hospital. Being a temperate young man
he had saved up quite a snug sum and was
looking forward to a trip to his old home.
About four months ago a tall blonde, giv
ing the name of May Wescott, arrived at
th hospital. She was a very sick woman
and appeared to be without friends or
money. Leon in passing through one of
the wards one day saw May nnd was smit
ten by her charms, and many little delica
cies lound their way to May's room, pur
chased by Leon's money.
Soon alter leaving the hospital the girl
promised to marry Marsh, who was the
happiest man in the world. He not only
purchased a diamond ring and pin for his
sweetheart, but he drew out his three
years' earnings from the bank, and three
weeks ago they came to Los Angeles. The
day following their arrival Leon proposed
to get out the marriage license, but May
said, "Oh wait a few days, until we loot
arouni." And so it continued until now
Marsh has given up all hopes, pronouncing
May several kinds of a fraud.
"My father is a wealthy planter in
Jamaica, and I have good friends in Oak
land. I have sent for money, which I ex
pect in a day or two, but I would like to
see that girl punished before I leave,"
were his parting remarks to the corre
spondent.

LOS ASGt.LES' U^EMTLOTED.
Reggars Fill the Streets and the Situation
/< Very Serious.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 11.â
unemployed problem is assuming a seri
ous aspect in this city. Notwithstanding
the ordinance intended to prevent able
bodied men from begging on the street-,
one is importuned at every turn of a cor
ner lor alms. Arrests have little or no de
terrent effect on the army of" beggars.
A committee from the Chamber of Com
merce met Â»o-day with a number of Coun
cilmen and representatives of the Mer
chants' and Manufacturers' Association
to talk over the unemployed situation.
The following Councilmen were present:
Messrs. Silver, Mathuss, Grider, Toll and
Ashman. The consultation lasted nearly
an hour in the committee-rooms at the
City Hall. All the methods of raiting
money to aid the needy were discussed.
The Councilmen made it plain to the
gentlemen assembled that the city's
finances would not permit of any aid from
that source. The street-sweeping propo
sition submitted by Mayor Snyder was
taken up, but it appeared that this plan
would cost the city about three times the
present cost of street-sweeping. There
was considerable talK of cutting down the
city officials and employes all along the
line.
AS EXPOSITIOX BUILDIXG.
Los Angeles Project to Erect a Mam-
moth Structure.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 11.â
Angeies is to have an exposition building
that will meet the demands of the times
and the size and importance of the city.
There is need of a bnilding suitable for
holding great expositions and talcing care
of large conventions and similar gather
ings. The city is well supplied in the wav
of theaters, streetcar lines, churches and
hotels, but there is a demand for a great
building specially built for exposition
purposes. This demand is to be met, and
a movement is now on foot to put at least
$100,000 into the project. The backers of
the project are such public-spirited busi
ness men as W. H. Perry. Max Meyberg,
O. T. Johnson and F. W. Braun and some
others equally interested. The plans have
not yet been matured, but it is the Inten
tion to have the building centrally lo
cated. Colonel Gray, who so successfully
managed the Home product Exhibition so
recently closed, talks enthusiastically of
the project, and says three is a demand
for such a structure, and that it will be
put up in the near future.
Touna Laird Convicted.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Feb. 11. â F. J.
Laird Jr. was convicted of obtaining
money under false pretenses to-day in the
Superior Court. Laird passed a bogus
check for $20 on a local grocery firm and
skipped to San Francisco. He was ar
rested there for having stolen a woman's
purse containing $160, but after lying in
jail three months the charge was dis
missed because the â¢ woman . refused to
prosecute, and he was turned over to De
tective Steele of the local department and
brought back for trial. Laird set up a
plea of . irresponsibility on account of
drink and having taken the gold cure,
but this was knocked out by tbe court.

TAKEN BACK EAST
FOR WIFE MURDER
The Checkered Career of a
Prominent Citizen of
Ritzville, Wash.
Disappears From His Home in
Wisconsin After the Crime
Ten Years Ago.
Marries Again and Is DivorcedâHis
Capture Effected Through a
Clever Attorn
SPOKANE, Wash., Fob. ILâ Mark W\
Townsend, a well-known schoolteacher
and prominent citizen of Ritzville, Adams
County, near here, was arrested at that
place to-day and started immediately for
Grant County, "Wis., where he is wanted
on a charge of murdering his wife ten
years ago. The arrest was made by Sheriff
McGonigal of Grant County, who ar
rived on the eastbound overland train
with extradition papers he had secured at
the State Capitol.
As the Sheriff stepped off the car
Townsend happened to be standing on the
platform. While the train was waiting
the Sheriff, in passing to the hotel bus,
recognized fcis man, made the arrest, put
him aboard the train and in five minutes
from the time he landed in town was on
the way East with his prisoner.
Attorney J. H. Hartson of Ritzville, on
whose information tne arrest was made,
thus details the facts that led to it:
"Eight years Townsend came to Adams
County. Nothing was known of his ante
cedents. He taught school, bectme well
known in educational circles, took up two
pieces of Government land and tried farm
ing. In time he married Miss Mary Wat
son, who before long complained to her
family of her husband's brutal treatment.
Last summer she instituted divorce pro
ceedings and a fierce feud sprang up be
tween Townsend and members of the
Watson family. The court granted her a
divorce and gave her the custody of her
two children
"Since the divorce was granted Town
-1 send has made threats repeatedly against
| "the lives of the Watson family, and has
1 further threatened to use dynamite against
' thorn. He had her brothers arrested re
; cently for defending her against bis at
tacks.
"While the divorce proceedings were
pending a letter came to his address from
' nis old home. It was from a former
friend, urging him to send money for the
j support of his children. This was the
I first knowledge his wife had tbat be was
i ever married before. Upon this clew I
I went to Grant County, Wisconsin, two
! weeks ago and learned the facts of his life
theie. In that county he bad manied a
young country girl. Ono day he was
cleaning a loaded revolver and was stand
ing three feet behind his wife with the
muzzle pointed at her hesd. The ham
mer was up. the pistol was discharged
and his wiie fell fatally wounded. The
Coroner's jury returned a verdict of acci
dental death and no proceedings were
brought against him.
â â ' "Soon thereafter Townsend left Ithe
country. After he bad disappeared other
circumstances came to the surface which
| created a strong presumption that be had
killed his wife. It v was further alleged
that he had taken one of his children and
hits its bead violently aeainst tbe wall ana
that from these injuries the child died a
few days later. But he had disappeared
from the country and no active steps were |
taken by the authorities to search out his
whereabouts. When I went to his old
home and told the story of his present
troubles the authorities promptly took
stÂ»ps to secure his arrest and extradition
irom the State of Washington."

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. ILâ The
presence of a large number of business
men and the earnest speeches made at the
meeting called by the Board of Trade last

quired having been already donated by
the F. A. Hihn Company, there remains
but little else to be done to secure the fac-
tory.

IN PURSUIT OF A
WIFE-POISONER
Police of Mazatlan, Mex.,
Want William Felt
Hermans.
Formerly Lived at Portland, 0:.,
but Now Believed to Be
in This City.
Story of a Fast You'ig Man Who
Wedded a Variety Actress and'
Tired of Her.
PORTLAND, Ob., Feb. 11.â William
Felt Hermans, formerly day clerk in a
small north end lodging-house, known as |
the Laclede, in this city, is wanted by the j
Mazatlan (Mexico) police for wife- poison- j
ing. He is believed to be in San Fran
cisco, having had ample time to encircle ,
the globe betweed the date of the commis- |
sion of the crime and its discovery.
Hermans and hi 3 wife left here about .
two years ago. When he came to this city :
in 1891 be went by the name of Felt Bur
ton. He claimed to belong to a Boston
family, that he was a Harvard graduate I
and that his visit West, was merely to I
familiarize himtelf with the country and
the customs of the people.
Strangely enough for a man of his
claimed birth and refinement John Corts
of the Standard Vaudeville Theater, on
First and Madison streets, had a mes
meric hold upon Burton-Hermans, for
toward the close of the first year of his
visit here, and for two months or more
afterward, Burton scarcely missed a night
there. i:/.;
Before the close of the year it became
apparent to ail the attaches of the Stand
ard, as well ss to the Bostonian's mere
intimate companions, that he was paying
particular attention to a very pretty and
quite demure young woman in the house
who went by the assumed name of Trixie
Marvin. About Christmas time, 1891.
Trixie vanished from the theater, the
surroundings of which were really offen
sive to her nature, and resumed a quiet
life with her parents on the East Side.
That ended Burton-Hermans' contribu
tions to the Standard Theater treasury.
It was somewhat of a puzzling mystery
to many of those whom Burton was feast
ing, willing and otherwise squandering
much money upon as to what could be bis
motive in remaining in this city so long
if his purpose in coming West was to
study tho country and the people. In fact,
the provincial, gossipy nature of two oi
three of the young men who were con- :
stantly partaking of Burton's hospitality
prompted them to write to Boston to as
certain their host's antecedents. But â 
their curiosity never was satisfied, and ;
even up to this day no one hare knows
who Burton, alias Hermans, was, beyond i
that he proved himself a prince of good j
fellows in the matter of lavishing money '
! upon those whom he fanciedâ when be
| had it
Early in 1892 Burton sprang another
surprise upon his swell companions by
marrying Trixie Marvin, without inviting
a solitary one of tbem to his wedding!
Mr. and Mrs. Burton soon thereafter left
for the Eist, and, oddly enough, returned
here in 1883 and kept up a stylish estab
lishment. Suddenly, however, that was
broken up, and Burton, assuming the
name of William Felt Hermans, accepted
the above referred to comparatively
menial position.
Burton did not overestimate the honor
able qualities of Trixie, for in his period
of adversity she stuck to him as if he were
a millionaire. The transmitter of the
news of Burton's criminal act knew him
here when he played the part of the
prince. He says that the Burtons lived
near Mazatlan about seven months under
the name of Hermans. They seemed to
be pretty well supplied wilh money, and
bad a very pretty cottage a lew miles out
side of the city limits. About two months
ago the couple disappeared, and three
weeks since, when the cottage was forced
open, the dead body of Mrs. Burton-
Hermans was found therein. A subse
quent analysis of the almost decomposed
stomach showed that death resulted from
strychnine. poisoning.
The writer says that the most conclu
sive evidence pointing to the husband's
guilt is his mysterious disappearance
under these circumstances. Mrs. Bur
ton's maiden name was Helen Mauldin,
and when a girl she lived near the South
ern Pacific shops.
IN MEMORY OF LINCOLN
Army Veterans Observe a Mar
tyr's Birthday With Song
and Speech.
An Oration by Dr. Dille and a
Memorial Ode Were Part of
a Fine Prrgramme.
The anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's
birth was celebrated last night in Union
square Hall, by Lincoln Post, Grand
Army of the Republic. ,
War veterans, old folk and youth filled
tbe auditorium beyond Its seating ca
pacity.
White bunting, star-decked, and here
and tbere held in place by the National
shield, was draped about the overhang
ing gallery and along the walls. The
stage, above and below, was decorated in
the National colors, and . conspicuously
placed at one side of the platform and
touched by the silicon folds of a great flag
was a portrait of the martyred President,
who, had he escaped assassination and
were he living, would be 83 years old.
Seated at the middle and front of .the
platform was Commander Mass of Lin
coln Post in mili'arv uniform and em
blazoned with medals, while ranged
behind in rows of seats were about thirty
pretty girls from the Normal School, who
sane several choruses during the evening.
Rev. Dr. Dille was the orator of the
occasion. Introduced with a humorous
reference to his unministerialarmy habits
he retaliated in kind upon Commander
Mass and then went into a spirited pictur
esque review of some of the characteristic
features of Lincoln's life. In part and in
substance be said: "
Great captains with, their guns and drums I
disturb our consciousness for au hour, but the
memory of Abraham Lincoln will' be as
cherished. irt-nhe dawn of the twenty-fifth
century as it is at the close of the nineteenth.
Abraham Lincoln inherited hi* courage, his
purity: and righteousness from his Puritan
ancestry, but from his mother, Nancy Hanks,
in whom was a strain of Irish' blood, he in
herited his stability of character, his persever
ance and ambition and his humor.
Having early floated a lalt of hogs and
bacon down the Mississippi to New Orleans at
$3 a month he there witnessed a slave auc- j
tion and was so wounded by the sight of an j
almost white girl being described aud offered |
to the highest bidder in a curious throng that j
he there and then' vowed' that when the op- j
portunity should rome he would strike a blow I
at slavery, and would strike it hard. J
It has sometimes been said of Abraham Lin
coin that he was not orthodox. His life was
orthodox. He said. "I'll keei> faith with friend
and foe." When Stanton flrst met Lincoln it
was out in the West in a law case in which
they had both been employed. As the awk
ward and curiously garbed Lincoln entered
the courtroom, without vest and with a long
linen duster, on the back of which was out
lined a great X from the sweat marks of his
suspenders, Stanton remarked that if that
gawk was to be in the case he was not.
This Nation showed that there is no people
so able 10 maintain a war as those who tax
th- involves; no soldiers bo great as those who
volunteer tnelr services for love of country.
The time is at hand when this Nation will
make a Lincoln's birthday a National holiday.
A special poem entitled "Lincoln."
composed for the occasion by Colonel W.
W. Stone, dedicated to Lincoln Post and
read by Miss Geornie Stone of Washing
ton, attracted considerable attention from
the patriotic audience.
The complete programme was as fol
lows:

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
THE FAKE MD THE FACT.
THE ZEPAKIE
The Examiner published for several days at th*
top of its title page the following fake:
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
249,757 Inches
Of Ads During J 896.
5964 More
Than were published by any
other San Francisco newspaper.
In the publication of this fake the Examiner
was probably not aware that a careful record was
being kept of the actual amount In Inches of its
advtriising and that In consequence it could be
confronted with the Wowing fact.
THE PACT
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
236,528 Inches
Of Ads During J 896.
That is one fact and here is an-
other :
THE CALL PUBLISHED
239,551 Inches

3,023 More
Inches were published in
THE CALL than in the
Examiner during J896Â»
It is to be remembered tba*. during 1895 th's
Examiner published approximately 800 Inches of
illegal lottery advertisements, or walch The Calx
did not and would not publish one. â¢
Ihe monarch of the fatÂ«rs has doubtless suc-
ceeded in securing thousands of Inches of adver-
tising during the past year by dup.n â  and deceiv-
ing advertisers through false and arrogant asser-
tions of the character of the foregoing fake. It
would seem, however, from the facts that the
merchants as a rule have not been misled by lis
fraudulent pretenses.
he Examiner boasts that Its books are open to
Inspection, tut we suggest that it inspect its own
l-ooks before it venture) uoon the publication of
another fake.
We congratulate the public on the fact that the
cxr osure of this fake led the Examiner to drop It.
In this the Examiner was discreet, and if lt ls wise
lt will make no more such bold attempts to
deceive the nubiic.

THE UTILITY OF A LIE.
In its report of the official investigation of water rates published yesterday morn
ing the Examiner saw fit to give space to the following paragraph respecting the edi
tor and publisher of The Call:
And all through the talking and the questioning, the halting of the witness and the chip
ping in of Attorney Kellogg, there sat on a back bench, his shiny hat in hand, his silvered cane
negligently lapping his boot, a carnation in his buttonhole, curled and groomed, a sight for
the people, Charles M. Shortridge, editor of The Call, which recently has espoused Spring
Valley's cause against the people. Men asked why he was there, alone, conspicuous. They
wondered whether he had not yet been paid. They speculated as to the amount he had re*
ceived. They laughed at the figure be was cutting, and mourned the loss of The Call from
the ranks of the people's champions. But he sat it out, wincing when Schussler winced, and
smiling when Schussler smiled. For he is now part of the company's "operating expenses."
The reporter who willingly penned this statement and the editor who permitted
it space in the Examiner each knew that the only grain of truth in it was the informa
tion that the editor of The Call attended the public and official meeting of the Board
of Supervisors for the consideration of water rates. As to the rest, whoever is respon
sible for its publication knew tben and knows now that it was and is a cowardly lie,
which the cur who penned and published it has neither the courage nor the manhood
to utter to the face of the editor of The Call.
The session of the Board of Supervisors held on last Wednesday to consider water
rates was an open meeting, which it was not only the privilege but the duty of citi
zens interested in the subject to attend. It was especially important and fitting that
the editors and publishers of newspapers should be present at that meeting in order
that the scope and plan of the investigation might be considered, and that it might
also be observed how honestly and intelligently the public servants were performing
their duty in the important matter before them. The great mass of the people can
not attend such meetings however much they may be interested in their result, and
they therefore have a right to expect from the daily press a full, fair and impartial re
port of the proceedings thereat. It was solely in order that the reading public should
be assured such a report that the editor of Tee Call went in person to the meeting of
the board.
A comparison of the report of that meeting as published in the Examiner with
that contained in The. Call will show clearly the advantage of the personal pres
ence there of tbe editor of this newspaper. The Examiner report was manifestly a
garbled, partisan, one-sided and unfair presentation of the subject. It was special
pleading of the grossest sort. It was evidently intended to excite prejudice rather
than to relate facts. On the other hand, The Call report was a full and fair and ab
solutely impartial reflex of what occurred at the meeting of the board, and such
shall be its every report of this important public proceeding.
We have culled from the Examiner its false and cowardly allusion to the editor of
The Call ior the purpose of illustrating the despicable methods of the herd of irre
sponsibles who are at present in control of the Examiner, and not with the inten
tion of bandying personalities with them. The editor of this newspaper has earnestly
endeavored in its management and publication to adopt the wisdom of Polonius*
advice to Laertes, "Beware of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, bear it that the
opposer may beware of thee." In deference to this counsel he has time and again
remained silent under the repeated assaults and foul and false aspersions
of the irresponsible character-assassins of the Examiner upon himself and his friends,
believing that the public would estimate at their exact want of worth emanations
from such a source. Whenever The Call has been reluctantly obliged to administer
the rod to the Examiner for its offenses against truth and decency the castigation
has been as vigorous as necessary and as brief as possible. In the present instance
we would not have deemed the malicious personal assault of this Ishmaelite in
journalism worthy of notice except to point a moral to the public mind.
The people of San Francisco need not expect that the water-rate investigation will
be fairly, honenly or truthfully reported in the Examiner when they find it uttering
such defenseless falsehoods as the above regarding an editor and a citizen who was
sufficiently public spirited to attend that investigation for the purpose of knowing
and publishing the truth. On the other hand the people may be fully assured that there
will appear in The Call an exact, complete and true report of every step in the pending
investigation regaiding water rates; that every (fficial who is honest, every witness
who is of good repute and every person making an earnest and intelligent effort to
bring forward the essential facts for a proper regulation of water rates shall receive
in the columns of The Call not only praise, but also protection from the assaults
of a newspaper which has long since ceased pretending to be either honest in its
estimate of character or truthful in its treatment of news.
ÃBMEES' INSTITUTES.
The address delivered by Professor Hil
gard at the Farmers' Institute in this
City on Wednesday evening was a con
vincing argument in favor of such meet
ings and a complete demonstration of
their value to all who are engaged in
rural industry, and incidentally to the
State at large.
The prof< Ssor pointed out that the rural
industries of California are in urgent need
of the instruction which can be given by
men of science and the advantages which
result from the maintenance of experi
mental farms under the supervision of
men of scientific attainments. In the
older States and in Europe, as he said,
agriculture has been practiced for a Jong
time, and as a result the farmers there
have found out fairly well by hard expe
rience what crops are best fitted for their
localities and what are the best means of
cultivating them. It is different in Cali
fornia. In this State we have new condi
tions. It is not yet known in many sec
tions, even io the most observant, what
rural industries are most profitable or how
best to conduct them, and therefore with
us scientific study and experiment are ne
cessities.
A further illustration, of the need of
farmers' institutes and agricultural ex
per.ment stations under control of the
university is shown in the fact that
the value of the work done by science for
our rural industry is not yet understood
by the people. The professor points out
that of all the farmers' sons at the Str.te
University, not a single one takes the
agricultural course, even as special stu
dents. The boys, as he says, have been
brought up to believe that farm work is
menial drudgery, and do not yet under
stand tbat agriculture requires the intel
lect as well as the muscle. There are few
industries where science can be more
profitably eniDloyed than in the tilling of
the soil and the growing of grains, trees
and vines, and California will not attain
her full prosperity until this fact is under
stood by her people.
By conducting farmers' institutes in
various sections of the State the univer
sity brings itself into close relation with
the farmers, and is enabled thereby to in
fuse among them something of the true
spirit of scientific agriculture. Through
these institutes it is made clear to the
people that many important benefits are
conferred upon rural industry by the sci
entific experiments made at the various
university stations. Farmers are saved
from the loss which would be entailed
upon them by making experiments them
selves, and the State is profited by the
demonstration under scientific supervision
that vast areas of land, hitherto consid
ered useless, can be utilized with rich
profits. ________________________________
The statement of Professor Hilgard
that not a single student at the univer
sity from the rural districts takes the ag
ricultural course even as a special study
shows how undervalued is the science of
agriculture in California, where our
farmers and orcbardists are the best edu
cated in the world. The very neglect of
the course emphasizes the need of it in
the State. If people do not understand
the valueof science in rural industry they
must be taught.
The report that the extra session of Con
gress will consider nothing but the tariff
raises the question what the Senate will
be doing while the House is' preparing the
bill and what the -'House will be doing
while the Senate is' wrangling over it. If
the tariff only can be discussed there will
be a great deal of slack time in both
houses.
The demand for good roads is heard in
all parts of the Union, and if there is any
virtue in demanding a thing we shall get
them.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY; FEBRUARY 12, 1897.
THE TEADE OUTLOOK.
While there is no pronounced activity
in trade, there are signs of improvement.
Wool, for instance, is feeling the benefi
cial effects of the anticipated protective
tariff, and, as has already been noted in
The Call's commercial columns, the in
dustry is looking up. The sales through
out the United States forthe past three
weeks have averaged 12,000,000 pounds per
week, and all over New England large
and small factories which have been idle
are starting up, giving employment to
many thousand men and women.
The hide market, which has been de
pressed for a long time, is showing a
firmer tone, and reports from Chicago tell
of an advancing market there. Grain bags
are rising in anticipation of abundant
crops. Beef and mutton have been in
active demand at higher prices for some
time, and now hogs are advancing.
Money is very plentiful, and solvent com
mercial borrowers lind no difficulty in ob
taining accommodation at normal rates
of interest, though the banks are disposed
to confine their loans to commercial ac
count. Failures are neither large nor nu
merous, and collections are up to the
average, and California is said to be on as
good financial footing as any other State,
and far better than many of them.
The only drawback is the slow decline
in wheat, which, however, excites no ad
verse comment, as it generally goes down
during the spring months. ' The most
pessimistic operator does not believe that
wheat will get below a point where it will
yield a good profit, and nobody expects it
to fall as low as it has been.
So, on the whole, the prospects for 1897
are very favorable.
STEEL BAIL POOL.
Public gratification in the rupture of the
steel rail pool which was announced at
Pittsburg on Wednesday will be increased
by the reports of the causes which led to
it. These make it evident that the col
lapse is due not to a loss of business, but
to an increased demand so active aud
promising that the various organizations
belonging tothe pool see their way to a
better business separately than in combi
nation.
. It is stated on what seems to be good au
thority that just after representatives of
the various mills in the pool had agreed
upon rates governing business in a partic
ular section of the country, some large
contracts came into the market and sev
eral of the concerns interested were offered
profitable business at lower rates than
those fixed by the pool. The temptation,
it seems, was too strong to be resisted and
the contracts were taken, with the result
that the pool went to pieces.
Rumor lias it that the prices fixed by the
pool were on a basis of $20 a ton for a cer
tain quality of rails, and thattbe concerns
which dropped out have fixed prices
on a basis of $17. This reduction means
a considerable advantage to the pur
chasers of steel rails, and even if prices
through competition should go no lower,
there will be a benefit to railroad builders
and to all districts of the country where
new railroads are needed.
The notable feature in the situation is
the fact that such large orders for steel
rails are in the market. This confirms
the frequent reports of a renewed activity
in railroad building and seems to give an
assurance that the depression in that in
dustry is about over. It is reported
that a single milling company in Illinois
has recently taken orders for the delivery
of 50,000 tons of steel rails during the
present year. It is also said tbat largo
orders have been placed by the Atchison,
Topeka and. Santa Fe road for use in im
proving the Atlantic and Pacific branch
ofthe system.
Renewed activity in tbe construction of
railroads Is almost tantamount to renewed
activity in all lines of industry. It is bard
to set limits to the trades which are more
or less directly affected by railroads.
When they begin anew the work of im
proving existing lines and constructing
eew ones they set into operation forces
which not only revive mills for rolling
rails but also those for the construction of
cars and locomotives. They give employ
ment to men along the line of road and
carry prosperity through wide regions of
country and to almost every business
along their routes. â¢
One feature of the sHuation should not
be overlooked. The organization of the
steel rail pool was forced upon the various
rail-manufacturing companies hy the pro
longed depression in the business. As
soon as industry revives the pool goes to
pieces. This is another evidence that
trusts are a result of hard times. A def
icit free-trade tariff compels American
manufacturers to organize trusts in order
to save themselves ' from ruin. A high
protective tariff means good business for
all, and under its operations the trusts
and pools go to pieces and free competi
tion is restored.

MR. GAGE AND THE NEW YORK
BANKERS.
Washington Post. r; 4 yy
About all the disagreeable and unkind
things that could be said about a man have
been said by New York bankers in recently
published interviews concerning the selection
by President-elect McKinley of Lyman J. Gage
to be his Secretary of the Treasury. One of
the Illinois members of Congress; yesterday
offered a little story as a reasonable explana
tion of all this ill feeling. /
"The New York bankers were nicely tricked
by Mr. Gage, during the panic of 1873, and
because he found and made use of a way to
beat them at their game they have neither for
gotten nor forgiven it," said the Illinois man.
"It was at the very begin of the money
stringency," he continued, "and Chicago
banks had something lit $25,000,000 in gold
on deposit with the New York banks, whica
they were making use of in the ordinary
course of busl: ess. When the panic became
extensive the Chicago men wanted to get their
money again into their own hands and drew
on the New York banks for it. The latter were
quite naturally very much | adverse to parting
with, so much good, hard coin, and paid the
drafts in New York Clearing-house certificates,
which were worth in Chicago something less
than Confederate currency.
' 'There was consternation among . the Chi
cago backers when the saw that the New
.Yorkers proposed to keep their gold. But Mr.
Gage solved the ridd and got the coin in a
roundabout, way, to be sure, but nevertheless
he got it. The Chicago banks, acting up in Mr.
Gage's advice, proceeded to buy $25,000,000
in gold in London," and paid for the same in
New York droits. These had to be met or go
to the wall and clearing-house certificates
didn't go in Loudon. The drafts were paid,
but with poor grace, and when it was learned
that Mr. Gage was the originator of the scheme
he was chalked down in their memory." -

THE NAMES OF THE NEW MEN-OF-WAR.
The new gunboats named by the Secretary of the Navy are No. 10, building at Elizabeth
port, N. J., Nos. 11 and 12 at tne Bath Iron Works, No. 13 at Dialogue's. Camden, and Nos.
14 and 15 at the Union Iron Works. They now hear the names of Annapolis, Marietta, New
port, Princeton, Vicksburg and Wheeling in their numerical order.
The Marietta, Princeton and Vicksburg were once more or less familiar names of vessels in
the navy; the Marietta of the civil war being an ironclad, single turreted monitor of 479
* -' tons, built April, 1866, at a cost of $235,040
and soid seven years later for $16,000. The
old Princeton was built at Philadel
phia in 1343 and was the first pro
peller built for the United States navy, and
also the first naval vessel in which John
Ericsson Introduced his invention of screw
propulsion. The vessel proved a decided suc
cess, marred only by the catastrophe on Feb
ruary 28, 1844, when at a gun trial in the
presence of many prominent officials the gun
burst and killed Secretary of State Up
shur, Secretary of the Navy Gilmer, Captain
Beverley Kenison and three others, besides
wounding several of the crew. In 1849 the
hull being badly decayed the ship was broken
up and another Princeton, somewhat larger,
was built in Boston in 1851. She did not
prove so successtul as the first owing to faulty
boilers, and she was eventually transformed
into a sailing vessel, and alter an uneventful
career as a storeship was finally sold in 1866.
mere was a vicKsourg pnrcnasea in iffoj at a cost of $125,000 and sold September 12,
1865, tor $50,400, being used during the war as a transport.
The names given to the new batile-ships. Nos. 7. 8 and 9, being built in the order given, at
Cramps', Union Iron works and Newport News are Alabama, Illinois and Wisconsin. There
was a line-of-battle ship of seventy-four guns in the old navy called the Alabama, built at
Kittery, N. H., the keel of which was laid in
1820, and launched January 23, 1864, when
her name was changed to New Hampshire.
During the war, and until within about a
dozen years ago, the New Hampshire served as
a storeship, later as a training-ship for boys
and has lately been loaned to the Naval Mlii tir.
of New York, the vessel being classified in the
navy register as "unserviceable." A side
wheel steamer of 1264 tons bearing the name
of A'nbania was purchased in 1861 for
$93,338 and sold in 1865 for $23,000. while
another smaller namesake, also purchased,
had her name changed to Fox and was sold in
1865.
The Confederate States, ft may be remem
bered, bad a cruiser by the name of Alabama,
built at the yard of Laird Bros., Birkenhead,
opposite Liverpool. During the war this craft
destroyed ships and property amounting to
mil. ions, which was subsequently partially
repaid by Great Britain.
In 18153 a screw sloop-of-war of 2490 tons, which was to be known as the Illinois, was
bepun and partially completed at Kitiery navy-yard. She was never launched however, and
was broken up on the stocks in 1872, and her engines and boilers, constructed' at an expense
of $414,633, went to the scrap pile. '
No vessel built for navy purposes or purchased for use of the navy has bad the name of
V\ Isconsln. ana the two new ships to be known henceforth as Illinois and Wisconsin can make
a record for themselves unaided or unhampered by the doings of prior namesakes. As to the
Alabama it is a rather remarkable coincidence to note that her shipyard number at Cramp's j
will be the same as her Confederate namesake bore in Laird's yard at Birkenhead.

Letters From the People.
THE BAKER MONUMENT.
A Plea for a Memorial to the liistin
ffulshed Patriot and State. man.
To the Editor of The Call: If the bill now be
fore the Legislature for an appropriation of
(15,000 for the erection of a monument in
Golden Gate Park to the memory of that gal
lant patriot, soldier and citizen. Colonel E. D.
Baker, who lost his life at the battle of Balls
Bluff In the late Civil War, becomes a law,
which is hoped for by all patriotic citizens, it
will add another attractive feature to that
beautiful breathing spot, in which everybody
takes pride.
To Colonel E. D. Baker California owes more
than to any other cause for having been kept
in this Union during the late unpleasantness.
It is hoped that the patriotic sentiment of the
people will be 'sufficiently aroused to cause
the Legislature to pass this appropriate meas
ure hereby the honor due tbe one it is to be
bestowed upon may be rightfully and properly
carried out.
The movement in this matter was begun in
1891 by Colonel E. D. Baker Camp of Sons of
Veterans of Oakland by the adoption of reso
lutions favoring the same, which were in turn
indorsed by the following State Encampment
of the Grand Army of tho Republic held at
Santa Cruz. Fr-m the start here given it the
Colonel E.D. Baker Monument Association
was formed in this City, in which many of the
prominent citizens were enlisted in the cause.
W. W. Montague was elected as the president
of the association and committees were ap
pointed to collect subscriptions thereto and"
were succeeding fairly well until the hard
times of the pest two years set in, which
caused a temporary suspension inthe matter.
The amount collected is safely deposited to
the credit of the association and will be added
to the sum that is a-ked for of the Legisia. ure
should it successfully pass that body. With
the introduction of the bill interest has been
revived 'in the matter and assistance is com
ing to aid. Resolutions in ,avor of the meas
ure have recently been adopted by the follow
ing organizations and lorwaideo to Sacra
mento: Colonel E. D. Baker Camp of Sons of
Veterans, the Army and Navy Republican
League of Oakland, and by several posts of the
G. A. R., as well as the recent Republican city
convention of Oakland. The matter is also
before the Loyal Legion for action.

Ironâ J. N ., city. Iron may be carburized
or decarburized by cementation, which is a
metallurgical process in which two substances
are heated in contact for the purpose of effect
ing some Important chemical change in one
of them. iron imbedded in charcoal powder
and exposed to a temperature over redness is
gradually converted, Into steel, and in' this
way steel was formerly made in large quanti
ties. This is carburization by cementation.
Again if cast iron be imbedded in the powder
of hematite and kept for some tme at a red
heat it is decarburized. This method is used
for producing what is known as malleable
iron. Malleable iron is also converted into
steel by keeping it In molten pig iron. I This is
a very ancient process and is a kind of
cementation. Iron is put on the market in
three forms which differ essentially in their
propertiesâ cast iron, which is haro, compara
tively brittle and readily lusible and cannot
be forged or welded; wrought iron, which is
comparatively soft, malleable," ductile, welda
ble and fusible at a very high temperature
steel, which , is also malleable and weldable'
but fusible and, what is of great importance'
capable of acquiring, by being tempered a
very high degr. c of hardness, so that it cuts
wrought iron with ease. The product ol the
blast furnace, of which wrought lr. n ann steel
are made, is called pig iron, but its qualities are
not sensibly changed by simple remeltliig and
casting. Steel, formerly produced exclusively i
from wrought iron by cementation, is now
largely made by the Bessemer pro-ess. This
process has in a measure obliteraiel the dis
tinction between wrought iron and seel. The
most striking feature of thechemica. c mp,
sitlon of the different grades of iron md seel
is the difference in the amount of carion they
contain. Pig Iron contains the mÂ»st and
wrought iron" theieast. ' -; yy \ y J ,r ; j
MUCH IN A NAME FOR OSHHOSH.
- The citizens of Oshkosh, Wis., have decided
to erect' a monument to Chief Oshkoih in
Norths ide Park. Oshkosh was the last of tha
Menominee sachems Â«nd played a prominent
part in the pioneer history of the Northwest.
The settlement at the mouth of the Upper
Fox River, planted in 1836, had beenci.U-i
Saukeer Point and Stanleys Tavern, but In
1840 the settlers named it Oshkosh in honor
of the chief. "The result proved," says the
Milwaukee Sentinel, "that Shakespeare was
laboring under a misapprehension when lie
propounded his famous interrogatory, 'What's
in a name?' There has been a great deal i a
one for Oshkosh, which is known all over the
English-speaking world on accouut of its
name. With some, especially ignorant for
eigners, its reality is doubted, and it is there
fore placed in the category along with Utopia
and Brobdignag. Among intelligent people,
however, it stands for a real, thrifty and en.
terprisiug city." â  .y" .

RETURN OF THE

The Craft Came in With
the Ship Glory of the
Seas.
Not One of Them, Outside of the
Herring Boats, Made a Good
Catch.
Simpson's Tug Columbia Had a Very
Successful Trial With the Wit
tram Propeller.
Lovers of fish will be disappointed when
they reach the markets this morning. The
fleet of small boats that went out Wednes
day night did fairly well, but still the
catch they brougbt in is nothing to boast
of. Herrings there are in abundance, and
tomcods are plentiful. The outside boats
brought in a fair assortment of codfish and
the up-river boats did fairly well. The
crab boats did not make enough to pay
expenses, however, and in consequence
those who want crab salad next Sunday
will have to pay extra for it. ..â.,-*.â .,..*.
The return of the fleet made a pretty
picture on the bay yesterday. The Glory
of the Seas was coming in with almost all
sail set and the fishing fleet was also com
ing in with the tide, and all were heading
for Fishermen's wharf. It was a fair
wind ana many of thera passed the crack
coaster as though she were standing still.
Even if they made a poor catch the fisher
men still had the satisfaction of running

The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
meda arrived from Sydney, N. S. W. via
Auckland (New Zealand), Apia (Samoa)
and Honolulu (Hawaiian Islands), yester
day morning. As usual the vessel was on
time and will be ready to sail on time
next month. Heavy westerly weather
was experienced between here Â«nd Hono
lulu during the outward-bound trip but
no damage was done. The vessel was be
hind time about lour hours at Honolulu
but Captain Van Oterendorp easily made
up tbe lost time. "
There is not an engineer in America
who has greater faith in his vessel than
.Little of the Alameda, and whenever he
is called upon he knows just what his
engines can do. In consequence the Ala
meda not only made up the small loss be
tween here and Honolulu, but pot in yes
terday morning an hour ahead of railroad
time.
The steamers of the Oceanic Steamship
Company's line beat railroad time nearly
every month in the year, and in conse
quence the traveling public^ and their
friends are always on the wharf between
9an l 10 A. M. on each arrival day in full
expectation of meeting their friends. Not
once in six months aie they disappointed.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 897.
overhauled and bad a new Wjttram wheel
putin her, had her trial trip yesterday.
Captain Swan was in command, and lie
ran the vessel from Folsom street wharf to
the Hunters Point drydock and back
again. The test was a most successful
one, and proved to tbe satisfaction of the
numerous captains aboard that the Co
lumbia is a two-knot faster vessel with a
Wittram propeller than she was with the
ordinary non-corrugated wheel. ;. :i'a
The company is now fitting propellers to
the tug Ida \V and the steam schooner
Albion. The Government authorities will
probably try it on the Quartermaster's
steamer McDowell, and should it prove a
success on her, it may be applied to the
warships. It is very hard work to get
stern-way on tbe AlÂ«Dowell and. should
the new wheel overcome that dilbculiy, a
great point will be gained.
The old bark Dominion, that eot into
trouble in Australian waters, was sold be
fore the Alameda left for $5000 by* the Ad
miralty Court. She will probably be put
in the South Sea Island trade.
The four-masted steel schooner Hono
lulu, the only steel schooner of her kind
in the world, is loading sugar at Honolulu
for San Francisco. She was built on the
Clyde lor this business and this will be her
first voyage as a sugar boat.
Tbe old bark Kosciusko is again on ber
way to San Francisco. She is, strange to
say, taking coal from one coal port to an
other. She goes from Newcastle, N. S.W.,
to Westport, N. Z , and as coal at the
former port is cheaper tban ballast the
Kosciusko took a cargo of black diamonds.
At Westport she will discharge the Aus
tralian cargo and take in a cargo of the
New Zealand article and sail for San Fran
cisco. Should she Ket here it will be one
of the brat cargoes of New Zealand coal
that has ever come to San Francisco. Sev
eral vessels have made the attempt, but
nearly all have had to put into other ports
and discharge.
The steamer Point Arena, which arrived
from Point Arena yesterday, came in

was begun yesterday in Judge Joachim

A Pullman palace car porter named A.
Briggs was the only witness heard, and
the case was continued until this after

Briggs claimed to have seen Chun Woon
Sing leave the barber-shop where the
murder was committed immediately after
the sound of the- pistol-shots, and fol
-1 lowed tbe fleeing man to the place where
be was arrested on Waverly place,
Colonel James Smith, for the defense,
attacked the character of Briggs on the
ground that be was only a tramp porter,
whose employment was ephemeral. on ac

at length on the great benefits that had
accrued from technical schools in Euro
pean countries.
He characterized technical education as
the best protection for the industries and
commercial welfare of the country, and
said that it was the duty of every muni
cipality, every State and tbe country at
large to see that such institutions were es
tablished and properly maintained.
"America has no vast standing armies
to maintain in a state of idleness, he said,
"and the American citizen is not taxed to
support such expensive bodies as the peo
ple ol European countries are. Therefore
there should be no financial reason why
America should not have magnificent
training schools, where the rising genera
tions can be taught useful and producing
crafts.
"We have them here in a small way,
the training departments of the Univer
sity of California, the Lick School and
those that are to be established, the Lux
and Wilmerding schools, but they are not
sufficient. Let us hope that in the future
we may see many more, and that ere long
America will rank and more than rank
with France, Scotland, England and other
European countries in the number and
diversity of its training schools."
The rest of the programme was as fol
lows:
Bass solo, "Plasir d'Amour"(Martin), Proles
sor Luul Crepaux, member Paris Xirand Optra;
selection, Knickerbocker Quartet; reading,
'â¢Victor Oalbralth," C. B. Newton, humorist;
selection, Columbian orchestra; accompanist,
Miss J. Heffernan.
The programme of the entertainment in
the gymnasium was as follows:
Orchestral music, tumbling, horizontal bar
class work, under direction of H. L. Dietz
M. D., physical director. '
An inspection of the building closed the
evening's entertainment.
History of Asphalt.
A lecture Saturday night at the Mechanics'
Institute Library will be delivered by Bernard
Bieneufeld upon the "Origin and History of
Asphalt." "The lecture will be illustrated with
siereopiicon views and will be popular in
character and non-technical, treating of the
occurrence and mode of formation of this ma
terial in nature and of its uses in the arts, and
it will therefore be of general interest to the
public and of especial Interest to wheelmen
and to those who are concerned with improved
roads and highways. All those Interested in
the subject are invited to attend.
OWNERSHIP IN THE AIR.
Massonk's House Overhanging His
Neighbor's Land Must Move
or Tay Kent.
A jury in Judge Hunt's court yesterday
confirmed the theory of the law that when
a person holds a title to a piece of land the
title extends from the middle of the earth
to the stars.
The suit of Adelaide and Amelia Vigan
ego against Benedetto Massoni was on
trial for the purpose of obtaining dam
ages on account of alleged trespass.
The complaint stated that Mr. Massoni
built a house adjoining the property of
the fair plaintiffs and allowed his struc
ture to project or jut over their land two
feet, but at no point tbe bouse touches
the ground owned by them.
Attorney J. A. Devoto contended that
the plaintiffs were not materially injured
because of the overhanging building and
were not entitled to any compensation or
relief. To this Attorney A. Ruef respond
ed that the property beneath the over
hanging building belongs to his clients,
and that if any one intruded, ho must pay
for the privilege or get out.
The jury took this view of the law as
presented by Mr. Ruef, and gave a verdict
accordingly. A writ of assistance will
now taken out, and Mr. Massoni will
have to buy the land, pay rent or chop off
that part of his building which overhangs
his neighbors' premises.
Iroquois Objections.
The Iroquois Club has sent the following
communication containing its objections to
any increase In the salary list:
City Editor Callâ cab Sir: Some good reasons
why all bills should be defeated Intending to raise
salaries of pub lc officials In the City and County

"Big Jim's" Guard on the Alert to
See That His Charge Is Not
the First Victim.
An ominous quiet rests over the Chinese
quarter. By the uninitiated this is taken
as a sign of peace, but those in a position
to know are aware that such is not the
case.
The present calm is due entirely, so the
veterans assert, to the presence of so
many police, and when the extra detail
is removed there is going to be more
trouble. When it does break out the war
is going to be fierce for very many rea
sons.
In the first place, "Little Pete's" death
remains unavenged. The Sam Yups will
never rest satisfied until the score is
evened up by the death of some promi
nent member of the See Yups. .ir, ".;
Then, again, an enforced quiet never
fails to lie hard on the heathen sense of
justice, and he i* totally unable to com
prehend why it is tbat the police should
step in and stop the fun without giving
him a chance to get even. In his peculi
arly framed mind this is hardly fair.
That the reign of bloodshed is likely to
begin as soon as the police relax their
vigilance is amply proved, not only by
precedent but by the statements lately
made by some prominent Chinese mer
chants desirous of peace.
"The next person killed in Chinatown,"
said a well-known merchant located on
Sacramento street yesterday, "will not be
hit by a bullet."
On being asked for an explanation of
his words he replied: "I mean simply
that he will not be shot. He will be killed
with a knife or a hatchet.
"A few days ago the Ding On Tong man
aged to hold a meeting without the knowl
edge of the police and discussed the propo
sition of evening up matters for the death
of 'Little Pete.' It was decided tbat the
best man, as being the most prominent of
trie See Yups, is 'Big Jim.' lie has been
unofficially marked for some time, and a
large reward has been placed on his head.
"They also say that the maj onty were
in favor of returning to the use of the
knife and the hatchet as an instrument
for murder. The revolver is said to make
too much noise and make the danger of
detection too great to be risked any
longer."
SCENES IN THE ORIENT.
Lieutenant C. M. Perkins Lectures on
Siam and Interesting Places
In India.
The Lick lecture given at Pioneer Hall,
under the auspices of the Society of Cali
fornia Pioneers, by Lieutenant C. M.
Perkins, U. S. M. C, was at once instruc
tive, interesting and amusing. The sub
ject, "Glimpses of i Siam, Borneo and the
East Indies," also included. China and
Japan. The lecture was illustrated by
stereopticon views.
Lieutenant Perkins, in describing his
three years' cruise on a man-of-war, com
menced in Japan and China. Many in
teresting anecdotes relating to his stay in
the lands of the almond-eyed pagans con
tributed greatly to the entertainment,
and not once during tbe whole lecture did
the general interest flag. The Chinese
method of judging, condemning and pun
ishing prisoners, though revolting, pos
sessed a certain amount of fascination.
Then coming to Siam, where the prin
cipal part of his time was spent, he spoke
at length of the King, his palaces and
brothers, for they occupy about all the

tures of the young Crown Prince (who
died on the 3d of last month) were then
thrown on the canvas, showing him to
have been an unusually bright but deli-
cate-looking boy; indeed, it could easily
be imagined, as Mr. Perkins said, that
overcrowding the little fellow's brain (he
spoke French, English and Danish, be-
sides his native language) had something
to do with his early death.
One of the most curious of his stories
was that of the "City of Women," a place
in the city. of Bangkok, set off all to itself,
with 9000 inhabitants, and where no man,
but by the King's authority, goes for any-
thing; in fact, it is a sort of perfected
woman suffrage community, for public
positions are held by the fair sex.

FORM REVERSAL
NOT APPRECIATED
Quicksilver Wins and His
Entry Is No Longer
Desired.
Three Out of Six Choices Downed
at the Track Over the
Bay.
Ltbengula Beaten Out a Nose by The
BachelorâBabe Murphy Takes N
a Mils Cash Easily.
After a variegated and troublous tour
ever tbe Montana and California circuit
last summer and a number of enigmatical
trips around local elliptics, the fast
sprinter Quicksilver und his owner, F.
Calloway, were brought to grief yester
day. One of eight starters in the final
race at Oakland, a sic furlong sprint, he
was but lightly considered by the talent
on the strength of his poor showing in a
race on February 8. Twenty to 1 was laid
against the Friar Tuck horse yesterday,
and with Spencer in the saddle he downed
a good field, among the number of starters
being Bueno, Simmons and Major Cook.
At his former appearance in a five and a
half spin on the date previously men
tioned he was ridden by the crack jockey,
Sam Doggett, and exhibited about as
much speed as a tramp searching for work.
The horse had evidently undergone the
embalming process and Doggett was put
up to mislead the public. The grave
diggers took the coin on that occasion
and Mr. Calloway probably congratulated
himself that his Montana vacation had
not been without its profitable results.
Now Owner Calloway and his chestnut
hurricane are at liberty to race on any
course but the one at Oakland, for the re
versal of form was so horrifying and
starring that the judges notified the
horse-owner that in future the entry ot
his horse would be refused. This was a
very lenient sentence, for ruling off the
turl for life of horse and owner would
have been a much more just rebuke to
owners of this iik.
The balance of the sport was both shal
low and deep at limes. When the hot
choice Lobengula was nosed out by The
Bachelor, a 4 to 1 chance, which was
caught by quite a number of tbe fair sex
in the stand, the faces of many of the
crowd were seamed with great furrows
and beads of perspiration larger than
English walnuts fell from their loreheads
nnd dropped with a resounding wh;tck on
the asphaitum pavement. Two other
favorites were also laid to rest. It was
not a profitable day for the regulars,
though the trip across the bay and the
chase of the gulls for morsels of bread
were much enjoyed by all.
G. Pacheeo's gelding Maseoro now seems
to be considerable of a racehorse. Start
ing at odds of 15 to 1 in the bsttin-r on
the first event decided, a seven-luriong
run, he came strong at the end and won
galloping from lhe 12 to 5 favorite Guttu
Percha. Well played at lours Whitestone
was a poor third. >;,'%.: .". r-'.\.-
Torpedo, which now and then runs a
fair race, tock the six-furlong dash that
followed very easily from May R, starting
a slight favorite over Philip H. The
black colt Defender was a good third,
ridden by H. Wilson.
There was no pronounced favorite for
the third race, also a six-iurlong selling
affair, Meadow Lark, Marjorie, Ricardo
and Morven all going to the post with 4 to
1 about them in the ring. Heading Mor
ven to the stretch, Marjcrie led until
within a few yards of the wire, when she
was nabbed and beaten out a nose by
Meadow Lark, piloted by "Skeets" Mar
tin. Two Cheers, escaping from a pocket,
finished a close third.
With Rey del Bandidos scratched, the
mile and a quarter run looked a very good

WELTER-WEIGHT FIGHT.
The Olympic Club May Mutch Grata
and Kyan for a Fifteen-Round
Bout.
Superintendent Kennedy of the Olympic
Club has already commenced to negotiate
for talent for tbe boxing tournament,
which will be held at Mechanics' Pavilion
in April or May. In all probability the
event of the evening will be a fifteen-round
contest b?tween Tommy Ryan and George
Green. The sporting people of New York
are of the opinion that Ryan would have
a tolerably easy game to dispose of Green,
but the Green of the present day is an
entirely different man from the Green of a
lew years ago, who fourrht the mysterious
Billy Smith. The superintendent of the
Olympic Club is very anxious to bring
Green and Ryan together, and if the East
ern man is willing to accept a good purse
and will fight Caiiforman at the welter
weight limit, his friends of the East will
have a chance to wager large sums of
money on their favorite, as the snorting
fraternity of this City will back the
Olympic boy strongly against any man in
his class. It*was rumored last* evening
that Che club intended to match Needham
and Green, but such a report was circu
lated by tbe friends of Needham and has
no foundation in fact.
The Manhattan Athletic Club will give
â  a first-class athletic entertainment at

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1897.
The first of Rev. Haskett Smith's Oriental entertainments, "The Pyramid-builders; or. The Myths and Mysteries of
Ancient Egypt,'' will be given at Golden Gate Hall under the auspices of the Brotherhood of St. Andrew and in aid of St.
Peter's Episcopal Church, on Filbert and Stockton streets. The Right Rev. W. F. Nichols, Bishop of California, will preside,
and all the Episcopal churches of the City nave combined to make this benefit p. {.rand affair. It is hoped that in tbis way
money enough will be raised to pay off the organ debt, which has lain heavily on the congregation for some time. The
lecture will be given next Tuesday evening, and it will be the first of a series on sights and scenes in the Holy Land, in Tur
key, Greece and in Egypt. The first one only, however, will, be for the benefit of St. Peter's.
St. Peter's Church is a small one, with a not unprepossessing exterior, and is comfortably fitted up inside. The accom
panying picture is from a photograph taken when the church was decorated for the Christmas holidays. Rsv. Mardon D.
YVilson Is the rector.
THERE WILL BE A
BURNS MONUMENT
A Most Successful Start
Has Already Been
Made.
Enthusiastic Meeting of the Per
manent Committee of
Twenty.
Colin M. Boyd Unanimously Elected
Chairman and Y. C. Lawson
Secretary.
The Burns monument committee of the
Caledonian Club met in Scottish Hall last
night for permanent organization, and
from the enthusiasm displayed by the
members and the fact that over $1800 has
already been subscribed, the movement
has started off under the most flattering
auspices, and its success may be considered
well nigh assured. ""
Chief D. R. McNeill of the Caledonian
Club presided, and after briefly referring
Colin M. Boyd of the Monu
ment Committee*
to the object of the meeting he ' said he
was ready to receive nominations forthe
position of chairman of the committee.
Colin M. Boyd said that it was the wish
of every one who had the success of the
movement at heart that Chief McNeill
should be permanent chairman, and he
moved that he be appointed, which was
seconded by D. R. Macdonald.
Chief McNeill ttiat he fully appre
ciated the honor, but as there were men
on tbe committee who had been iristru
mental in building up the club almost
from its organization and had been the
leading spirits in every movement tend
ing to rdvance the interests of Scotch
societies and the best interests of the
municipality' and State, he thought that
one of them would do more fitted to oc
cupy the position. He had been.instru
mental in getting such an important com
mittee ' together, which was one of the
most important steps in the movement as
he felt sure such a committee could not
fail to accomplish anything it undertook.
He respectfully declined the honor.
John F. Kennedy then moved that Colin
M. Boyd be appointed permanent chair
man and in doing so ho paid a intih com
pliment to the popular ex-chief for what
be had done for tho club, the City and
State.
: William , Nicol and D. R. Macdonald
rose simultaneously to second the motion,
which was carried by acclamation amid
applause. Chief McNeill warmly con
gratulated ex-Chief Boyd on rescuing the
chair to htm, and the latter expressed his
thanks for tbe honor conferred unon him
in lifting terms.
Chief McNeill nominated Y. C. Lawson
as permanent secretary, and George
Davidson seconded the nomination, which
wÂ«s unanimously carried amid applause.
The secretary briefly returned thanks. *
A resolution was submitted that the
chairman appoint a committee of ihree
lo recommend the rules of order, per
manent organization ' and mode of pro
cedure. '.'â â  . ,
; Chief McNeill, before the resolution was
put, asked that Andrew Wilkie, president
A LECTURE IN AID OF ST. PETER'S.
of St. Andrew's Society, be made a mem
ber of the committee. The resolution of
the Caledonian Club appointing the mon
ument committee of twenty empowered
committee to add another twenty names
and he wanted President Wilkie made
one of the twenty. He moved to that
effect and the motion was carried.
The resolution was then adopted and
the chairman appointed James McNab,
ex-president St. Andrew's Society, John
F. Kennedy, ex-chief Caledonian Club,
and Y. C. Lawson, tne permanent secre
tary, as th* committee of three.
A resolution was adopted that a com
mittee of three be appointed to select the
additional nineteen names to act on the
monument committee, and Chief McNeill
of the Caledonian Club, President Wilkie
of St. Andrew's Society and Chairman
Boyd of the monument committee were
appointed. :* :â ".â¢;. -y . : : _â¢ --
Chief McNeill then explained what had
already been done and how it was proposed
to raise funds. The Caledonian Club had
donated $1000 and there wis $150 in the
treasury of St. Andrew's Society, which
hud been handed over by the defunct
Burns Club. Several small subscriptions
had already been promised by letter and
verbally, and the Caledonian Club had
agreed to defray the current expenses of
the committee until the annual gathering
and games in May. The receipts of the
annual gathering and games this year,
ami each year till the total amount was
subscribed for the monument, would be
banded over to the committee by the
club. St. Andrew's Society was to eive in
the near future an entertainment on a
large scale, the proceeds to be given to the
fund, and it was proposed to hold a grand
Burns festival in the fall, which would
bring in a great deal of money. Other
plans had been proposed which could be
discussed later. He felt that the spirit of
enthusiasm in the committee was equiva
lent to having the monument built.
A few members put their names down
on the subscription list, ami including the
$1000 from the Caledonian Club and $150
in the treasury of St. Andrew's Society
the total amount subscribed was over
$1800.
WAIT GIVES REASONS.
Endeavorers Cannot Stop Over
in Southern California
Going Home.
This Would Bj Obviated by the
Passage of the Anti-Scalping
Amendment.
Rolla V. Watt, chairman of the Six
teenth International Christian Endeavor
committee, explained further yesterday
his official interest and the interest of
Christian Endeavorers in general in the
bill to amend the law so as to prohibit the
scalping of railroad tickets. "He said:
"Holders of tickets cannot stop on the
return except on the Northern lines as
lollows: West of Banff on the Canadian
Pacitic, west of Havre on the Great
Northern, west of Livingston on the
Northern Pacific and west of Shoshone
Falls on the Oregon Short Line. There is
no stopover on the return trip on the
Central Pacific or the Southern Pacific
lines. This will prevent those who come
over the central routes from seeing South
ern California except at a large expense
unless the rules are moderated.'' J,v.f
"We will do everything we can to have
them changed. >r' s.-r
"This is the natural precaution taken
by railroads to prevent the tickets being
frightlully scalped. The railroads are
imposed on by unscrupulous people on the
occasion of large gatherings. The rates
are open to all, ana this is no reflection on
Christian Endeavorers, for the officers and
committees of this ' organization have
always made their best efforts to f.ecure
fair dealings with the railroad companies
on these railroad rates.
"The same 'rouble," concluded Mr.
Watt, "occurs every year. 1 thought that
if this anti-scalping amendment were
passed it would do away with all this dif
ficulty. 1 am as sure of it as lam of â
well, of ny name."
The above results are shown by the
schedule issued by Manager Caldwell.
Some action, according to Mr. Watt, will
be necessary before the tickets are placed
on sale or Christian Endeavorers will not
be able to visit one of the most delightful
sections of California. Mr. Watt declined
to say what steps are being taken to make
a change and extend stop-over privileges
in this State. BSSSSSfoSg

TRIED TO KILL
A SHIPMASTER
Nashville Grant Brought
Here to Answer for
His Crime.
A Murderous Assault Commit
ted at Port Pirie,
Australia.
Captain Eillman Hid a Narrow
Escape From Death at the Hands
of a Negro Sailor.
The steamship Alameda, which arrived
yesterday from Sydney, Australia, brought
a desperate would-be murderer in irons to
be tried before the United States courts.
The prisoner is Nashville Gr.tnt,a negro
sailor, who stabbed Captain Killman of
the American bark Topgallant while on a
recent voyage to Port Pino, Australia.
Grant shipped at Port Townsend for the
trip to the colonies, and early in the voy
age began to show an ugly disposition.
He was surly and refused to do work as
signed to him, and Captain Killman told
him several times that unless he obeyed
orders he would be put in irons.
On September 30 Grant tried to sharpen
a sheath- knife in the carpenter's shop and
threatened to kill "Chips" when the use
of the latter's appliances was refused.
Fearing trouble, Captain Killman ordered
Grant to give up the weapon, and, on his
refusal, had him put in irons. Grant
begged to be released, promising to behave
himself and give up the knife if allowed
his liberty.
The master finally relented and Grant
went back to work.
On October 3. tne day of his release.
Grant went to the quarterdeck ostensibly
to surrender the knife and get same medi
cine that he had requested. The captain
spoke with the negro fur a moment and
then turned and went into the" cabin,
where he was followed by the sailor.
A moment later a veil of "Murder!"
came from tbe captain's quarters, and
Second Mate Brown dashed into the
cabin to find the master of the bark on
the deck with Grant on top of him pre
paring to beat his brains out with a sjove
leg. Brown struck the negro and the lat
ter ie't the prostrato captain, who was
covered with blood, and chased the mate
out on deck. He had just caught Brown
and was preparing to stab him when
others of the crew took a hand and dis
armed the would-be murderer. He was
ironed and chained to tbe deck.
It was found that Captain Killman bad
received seven stabs, three about the head
and four in the body. When the vessel
reached Port Pirie the consular agency
at Adelaide was notified and measures
taken to secure Grant's return to this coun
try for trial.
When the depositions of the crew were
taken at Port Pirie, it developed that Grant
bad a companion who abutted him in his
mutinous conduct and that both of them
had tried to stir up a rebellion among the
crew. The other man will be arrested and
sent here for trial.
Grant is in charge of the United States
Marshal, and will b3 arraigned when the
Topgallant returns, in about four months.
When the Alameda left Captain Killman
had nearly recovered from his wounds.
BUDDING THEOSOPHISTB.
Subjected to a Ittle Wholesome Crltl-
ciim by James M. Pryce.
James M. Pryce of New York, speaking
before the Theosophical Society Tuesday
night in the hall of the Academy of
Sciences, had a few words to say about
the mistakes of theosophists. ,
He was particularly revere upon, or
rather â¢ humorous at the expense, of the
tyro, who makes the mistake of supposing
that theosophical ideas can only be ex
pressed in Sanscrit. After ten years'
study, devoted to that and other lan
guages, the speaker had arrived at the
conclusion that his own ideas were not so
vast hut that they could be adequately
conveyed in good plain English. He con
tinued : i-. . .
The budding theosophist, you know, when
he first discovers that he has seven principles,
is both t.urprised and pleasedâ pleased to find
that there is so much ot him. Then he learns
tneir respective names. in Sanscrit and pro
ceeds to develop them.' He does so with the
object of becoming an adept, and the way he
goes about it is extremely strange.* He im

TbÂ» fie- yf
i'.sili /y . -â.i * ; tw
aaines that these adepts are mysterious be
ings who sit under banyan trees in the wilder
ness until their seven principles are fully de
veloped. Some of our budding theosophists,
if they didn't go so far as forsake their wives
and families, used to wait until they died, and
would practice meanwhile in order to become
clairvoyants.
One man I knew would stare idiotically at
nothing in the dark, and if ne could only con
jure up a spook he was happy. Others thought
that the 7 could develop their seven principles
by holding their breath, and a man I knew
kept it up until be actually burst one of h.s
lungs. Then I knew another who went to
India to hunt for adepts, very much as we
would hunt lor jack-rabbits.
I have met people who professed to teach
everything from palmistry up io a knowledge
of Almighty Godâ for a consideration. when
a fee is demanded for the communication of
things spiritual, you are safe iv going some
where else.
Cattermole Will Marry.
Henry J. Cattermole won a victory in the
suit which Marsiaretta Mublhausen brought
aeainst him for $10,000, on account of alleged
breach of promise. She said she prepared her

way from New York in order to carry out her
part of the agreement. Cattermole admitted
that he promised to wed the fair lady, and an
nounced that he i? still ready at.d willing to

Muhlhausen abandoned her action at law, and

THE COONEY CASE
Opposing Attorneys Talk
on the Issues in the
Suit.
The Notary's Attorneys Claim
That No Case Has Been
Mads Out.
Judge Cook to Review Evidence and
Render a Decision a Week
From Saturday.
The first chapter in the Cooney case
was completed yesterday. The lawyers
concluded arguments and Magistrate Car
roll Cook promised a decision a week from
Saturday next.
It was a field day of lesral rhetoric In
the morning Attorney George A. Knight,
as special prosecuting officer for Charles
L. Fair, and Assistant District Attorney;
Hosmer taiked for the prosecution. In
the atternoon Attorney Patrick W. Reddy
had the floor in the interests of Cooney.
. The closing scenes attracted a larce
â¢'crowd. The issues were elaborately ar
gued. There were references to tbe
â¢'mathematical demonstration" the Fair
people had promised that the proofs of
the Crocker notarial blanks of January 8,
?SÂ»5. would correspond in the matter of
lieiects with other flaws in the certificates
on .the pencil deeds. Knight narrated a
. chapter in defense of the possession of
wealth and commending the connection
of Captain Lees with the case. Lengthy
legal decisions were also read.
Reddy talked of the seriousness of a
â¢ perjury case, and the idea that the prose
cution of Cooney had a deeper motive than
â¢ his ere conviction.
Knight opened first. He had little to
â  say of the details of evidence. He was
anxious to defend the bringing of the
p.ction before a Judge of the Superior
Court, when the proceedings were pre
liminary. The reason was that the array
of legal talent engaged lor Cooney would
have dazzled and confused an ordinary
Police Magistrate.
"Imagine my learned friend Judge
Campbell or my friend Judge Joachimsen
turning from an ordinary morning work
and hearing the hair-splittitm arguments
of the attorneys on the other side," he
said. There was more in the same strain.
It was his idea that the Fair people had
' produced the one witness necessary to
substantiate a charge of perjury.
"We say," he said in conclusion, "that
the prosecution has shown that it. is abso
lutely impossible that on September 21,
18y4,-tbe defendant could have attached
to toe pencil deeus his notarial certiri-
Hosmer devoted his time to comparing I
and enumerating in detail the typographi
cal defects in the Crocker blanks and the ]
similarity existing between them and |
others in the Cooney certificates on the ]
j encil deeds. Technical argument on the
evidence necessary to secure a convict. on
on. a charge of perjury followed.
tt was tne centra! idea in the reply of
ile ;dy that there was no case made out
against Cooney.
"Your Honor would not bind a man over
on testimony as disconnected as has been
offered here,'' he began. "You and I and
.iJi know the power of money. I am not
Ending fault witn that power or the pos
session of it, but simply calling to your
attention the fact that ii does exist. The
:heory han been advanced, or rather the
intimation has been made, that tbere is
an absent witness, and that when this case
.would be resumed in the Superior Court
more evidence would oe forthcoming.
The prosecution here ts not holding back
anytbia . Is it going to be said that
Captain Lees has left out "You I from

praise of Captain Lees, that it is improb

â¢At least 1 do not believe that he nas.
"It is a serious thing to accuse a man of
perjury, but it is more serious still when
detectives and microscopes are hired at
every turn to accomplish this purpose."
Beddy then b?_an to analyze the evi
dence of Herbert Clarke, who was fair's
valet. The attorney for Cooney said
Clarke was the one witness th& prosecution
had relied on to effect a conviction.
â¢ "ClarKe admitted that it would have
been possible for Fair to visit Cooney's
office," said Reddy, "when he said that
Fair was able to attend a meeting ot the
Mutual Bank directors."
Magistrate Cook said he would go over
the-deiails of the evidence at once, and
promised a written opinion, owing to the
importance of the issues involved.
GOOD AND BAD LAWS.
The Manufacturers Diacusa Several
Measures Now Before the
. Legislature.
The board of directors of the Manuiac
. turers' and Producers' Association met
yesterday and seveial matters pending be
fore the Legislature were discussed. The
special committee recently appointed to
look into the merits of Labor Commis-
ission er Fitzgerald* labor bill (No. 44)
reported that section 6, to which objec
tions had been uiaue, had really been
copied from the original act of March 3,
' 18S3, under which the Bureau of Labor
Statistics was formed, and that since that
.date it had operated successfully and had
AUen beneficial in its character.
f A long discussion resulted npon Man
ager Lewis' report of the bill whicn is
intended to regulate the manufacture of
. articles by convicts. The bill previously
indorsed by the association prohibits the
manufacture of anything but jute baes,
and also forbids the crushing of rock by
convicts except for use on country roads.
.â¢A substitute includes streets- and .high
ways. President Sonata^ abserted that
nearly all the rock now crushed at Folsom
for roads goes to Sacramento and Stockton,
and much is used for foundations . for
private buildings. It was decided to again
indorse the hill in w.iich the use of crushed
rock is limited to county roads.
Director Kerr introduced a sweeping
resolution relative to convict labor. He
raid that the prison director- propose to
increase the machinery in the prisons for
the purpose of increasing the output of
products. He said that the cotton-mills
of O.'-kland would enter into the manu
facture of jutebags if there was no com
petition by convicts. What he proposed
was thai the Legislature be asked to pass
a bill providing forthe doing away with
all power machinery in the State prisons.
â¢ -H p stated that this has ben done success
fully in New York and several other East
ern States, and if done here it would he of
great benefit to free labor. He would do
away with machinery after December 31,
1897. ' rXirr'y'
. rector Keller said that he believed
thit prisoners should be made to work
With' their hands and not be aided by
power machinery. At the present time
there is over a million dollars tied up in
fadeless machinery at San Quentin, sash
â¢nd door, harness, furniture and other
ison industries having been abandoned.
U'bere should not be moie machinery
put in.
Director Allen called attention to the
great benefit of cheap grain bags to the
farmers and said that the State has too
much money tied up in machinery to let
it lie idle hereafter. The matter was re
fer! Ed to the legislative committee, to be
reported on next Thursday at a special
meeting.

Among the arrivals here on the steamer
Alameda yesterday were eight famous
crusaders who have been on a tour of the
world. They were the distinguished the
osophists about whom the dispatches
have been telling for many months past.
The list comprised E. T. Hargrove of New
York, president of the Theosophical So-
Mrs. K. A. Tingley, the Leader of Thecsophical Thought and
Head of the Esoteric School, and E. T. Hargrove, President â¢
of the Theosophical Society of the World.

Blavatsky; Mr. Olcott and other famous
lights; Mrs. K. A. Tingiey, the leader of
theosophical thought throughout the
globe, in a word delegated as the cru
sader, the lady is the successor of the
late William Q. Judge and head of the
esoteric school; Mrs. A. L. Cleather; Mr.
and Mrs. C. 1". Wright, the former being
president of the Aryan Society of New
York; H. T. Patterson, president of the
Brooklyn Theosophical Society; F. M.
Fierce, traveling representative of the
school for theosophical research ; Rev. W.
Williams, a clergyman of England,. who
having met the tbeosophists in England
and become impressed with the truths
they taught concluded to go on the tour
with them.
All seemed to be in good health. They
said they bad seen much, had gained
many thousands of converts, and more
than ever saw the need of working in the
interest of theosophy.
President Hargrove, who appears scarcely
3) years old, and who was a barrister-at
law lor some years in the Middle Temple,
London, gave an interesting account of
their travel?. He first gave a running ac
count oi tho personnel of each. Asked
about Mrs. Tinglcy, the head of the
esorteric school, he said :
"It is rumored she is to found a direc
torate of the School for the Revival of the
Lost Mysteries of Antiquity which is to
be founded at San Diego.
.." Mr WriKhl was secretary to the late
Mme. Blavatsky. and also to the late W.
Q. Judge. Mrs. Cleather was one of Mme.
Blavatsky's favorite pupils.
'â¢As is well known, we have been on a
tour of the world. We left New York
June 13 last on a crusade, and have visited
many, countries, including En "land Ire
land, Wales, France, Germany, Austria
and others, and went to India, Australia
New Zealand, Samoa and on here. " '
'Our object was to carry a meÂ«sage of
brotherhood from nation to nation. We
had large audiences and made many con
verts. It is not too much to say we made
many thousands of these. We also formed
many new societies.
"Wo organized no less than eight nation
al divisions and twenty-one branch socie
ties. At Athens, in Greece, where we
were but two days, we left a society of 110
members. In India we have a treat many
with fifty or sixty in each in Delhi, Luck
now and others. In some places the
interest shown was simply wonderful.
"I would particularly like to have it
known that the crusade has collected no
money while en route. The expenses
have been paid in full by ourselves. We
have paid our own way and did not even
take up a collection anywhere. There has
been no charge of any kind for anything
we have done."
"Among the wonderful instances of in
terest in our work I may mention an ex
perience of ours in Austria. We were told
thai we could not possibly hold a meeting
there under five days. The officials would
not permit it. They would not allow us
to use the word 'brotherhood' in our
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1897.
talks. Well, as we were teaching a com
mon brotherhood it looked bad for us.
"But we got out everywhere and saw
about fifteen of the leading officials and in
two days they agreed if we would not in
any of our talks use word we could go
t th'teen of the leading officials and in
lays they agreed if we would not in
>f our talks use this word we could go
ahead. We held the meetings, the of
ficials being present, and you can imagine
how hard it was not to use the word, bnt
we talked around it and succeeded, and at
the end of the meeting there was a tre
mendous crowd, who announced them
selves as in favor of theosophy. Among
them was one of the officials.
"What they had feared was something
in the interest of socialism.
"In Delhi, favor of lheosophv. Among

hat they had feared was something

i Delhi, India, the peopie wen* fairly
wild. They put two floral wreaths over
the neck of Mrs. Tingley and she bad to
stand there and speak in that way. There
and- elsewhere the Mohammedans and
Hindus, races that for ages had hated
eacb other, and wno have always refused
to have anything to do with each other,
united as brothers. There never was any
thing like it.
"We were at Bombay for two weeks dur
ing the famine and witnessed the terrible
eufferiwg from that and the bubonic
plague. One woman had been living on
charcoal and cinders. Her husband sold
their child for a sum equal to about 10
ct-nts, and when she heard of it she fell
down dead. There were tens of thousands
of similar instances. Millions of the 300,
--000,000 of the population of India are
dying. :
"It is our idea to collect grain and other
kinds of food and send to these miserable
people."
lt is on February 15 that the corner
stone of the school for the Revival of the
Lost Mysteries of Antiquity is to be laid
at San Diego. Ali the theosophists will
be there and take part. Mr. Hargrove
says it is not the idea to tell too much
about this school, for fear many more will
be started for the purpose of making
money, and money destroys the good ot
the school.
On Sunday night, at Odd Fellows' Hall,
all ihe visiting theo'ophists will appear
and deliver addresses. It is expected a
large audience will be present.

The directors of the Olympic Club, at a

to hold a professional boxing tournament

They authorized Superintendent Billy

The pugilists will be offered a good

MERCHANTS TOLD
TO CALL AGAIN
Complaint- That They Were
Treated With Scant
Courtesy.
Street Committee of the Super
visors Failed to Receive
Them.
After Passing Ha f an Hcur Wa ting
Word Was Sent That a Confer
ence Was Put Off.
â  â
' The officers and active member* of tho
' Merchants' Association believe that they
were treated with scant courtesy by the
Street Committee of the Board of Super
visor* yesterday. The trouble was brought
about this way: At the last quarterly
meetine of the Merchants' Association
resolutions were adopted requesting the
Board of Supervisors to prepare future
contracts for street pavements so that
any suitable materials might be accepted
that have proved desirable and reliable in
the experience of other cities. On Janu
ary 22 the board of directors sent these
resolutions to the Supervisors, with a pe
tition to be heard upon this subject, when
facts and figures would be presented in
support of the resolution. It was also re
quested that all others interested in this
matter should be heard at the same time.
In answer to this communication, the
consideration of the subject of suitable
materials for street pavements was set
by the Committee on Streets of the Board
of Supervisors for yesterday afternoon at
2:30 o'clock. In accordance with written
invitations received by the Merchants'
Association to attend the meeting and
take part in its deliberations, a large dele
gation of the directors of the association
was promptly on hand at the rooms of
the Board of Supervisors at the hour
stated.
Those present in the delegation were
the following directors an representa
tives of the association: Messrs. F. W.
Dohrmann, James S. Conweii, A. Fusenot,
M. 8. Kohlberg, Henry Michaels. Joseph
Sinionson, Frank A. Swain, S. L. Sachs,
Secretary Freud, Engineer McCuliough
and a number of other citizens, all inter
ested in securing the best paving materials
for future street worK without discrimina
tion or favor to any particular substance,
and prepared with valuable data for sub
mission to the committee.
Promptly at the hour set these gentle
men were lined up in the anteroom wait
ing to be heard, so that they could go
back to their places of business again.
Time passed, but :hev were not called.
At last after half an hour's waiting word
was sent in to the chairman of the Street
Committee that representatives of the as
sociation were present. They were ereatly
surprised and even angered when the an
swer was received to call again next
Thursday. They went away disgusted,
and openly expressed their annoyance at
such treatment. The former Board of
Supervisors in November, 1895, adopted a
resolution inviting the Merchants' Asso
ciation to meet with its committees at all
times, and set forth that lhe merchants
would be accorded a hearing at all times
and upon all matters. Evidently the
present board has different views on this
subject, or this summary postponement of
an important subject would not have
taken place.
The Street Committee of the Super
visors has set apart next Thursday after
noon to hear representatives of the Mer
chants' Association concerning the adop
tion of asphalt specifications tor City street
work. .. _â¢
JAPANESE CELEBRATION.
Coronation of an Emperor and the
Grunting of the National Conatl
tion Commemorated.
The Japanese are nothing ii not patri
otic, and this side of their character was
exhibited at a meeting under the auspices
of the Japanese Society of San Francisco,
which was held at Saratoga Hall last even
ing.
The object was twofoldâ first, to celebrate
the coronation of Emperor Jimm, the first
Japanese monarch, who was crowned
about 2500 years ago, and, second, to com
memorate the graining of a constitution
tothe Japmese people, which took place
eieht v years ago on the anniversary of the
'first-mentioned event.
The meeting was presided over by Rev.
K. Mekami and S. Vamura delivered the
address of welcome. After a musical selec
tion had been rendered the audience sang
the national anthem standing and did
homage to the present Emperor's portrait,
which occupied a prominent place on the
platform. The rest of the programme
was as follows:
Reading of Japanese constitution, K. Tat
suno; address, S. Segawa of the Japanese con
sulate; address, T. Takckawa; oration, K. Ya
mada; three cheers for the Emperor ana bee
ond singing of the national song with hom
age.
The second part of the entertainment,
which was presided over by Dr. K. Kuro
sawa, consisted of music, songs, fencing,
wrestling and magic-lantern exhibition.
Several hundred Japanese filled the hall,
which was draped with the Japanese col
ors, and all seemed to enjoy the entertain
ment thoroughly.
TO ORGANIZE A
FARMERS' CLUB
The Farmers' Institute
Accepts Mr. Holman's
Motion.
"
_
Mrs. Harriet Conness of Berke
ley Reads an Instructive
Paper. *
Va'uabls Suggestions for the City
Man Who Si;bs for a Bucolic
' Existence. {.:".. *-i-
Two interesting papers were read at last
night's session of the Farmers' Institute
in the Academy of Sciences Hall. Mrs.
Harriet N. Conness of Berkeley described
the profitable uses to which small pieces
of land can be devoted, her paper being
â¢pecially designed for tbe benefit of City
residents of small means who sigh for a
bucolic existence. Alfred Holman, editor
of the Rural Press, in a paper entitled
"City Farmers' Clubs," gave some in
structive details concerning organizations
of farm-owners for useful work in the pro
-1 motion of agricultural prosperity. He sug
gested that the example set by other
cities in this respect might with advant
age be imitated by San Francisco.
The chairman of the evening, Edward
F. Haddock, offered some introductory
remarks on the objects of farmers' insti
tutes and agricultural colleges, generally
pointing out that, while it is the province
; of the latter to instruct, the application
of that instruction must.be left to the
practical farmer. The city resident in
terested in these problems could make
valuable contributions to their solution if
he did no more than assist ingatherings
of this nature where, among other useful
subjects, that of a market lor agricultural
products could be more profitably dis
cussed than in the country districts.
Mrs. Conness, whose remarks embodied
the results of actual personal cxi erience,
termed agriculture the bans of knowledge
in material things, and added that: it
should be the key io things spiritual. A
beneficent intelligence had provided all
the means for human development and
happiness, in spite of which there pre
vailed great misery and want. Though
the earth would yield abundantly it was
well to bear in mind that unless you could
market your product you could derive no
profit from a small holding. The pro
ducer of the food supply was the most im
portant factor in human life. The pro
ducer, therefore, should be given the
right of way.
Proper knowledge and good roads for
safe, cbeap and rapid transportation were
all essential to success. One serious stum
bling block in the way of the would-be ag
riculturist was the indifference displayed
by women to the study of country life.
This indifference deprived the farmer of
a suitable companion, and another direct
result of female ignorance in this direc
tion was the adulteration of the food sup
ply due to her inability to purchase in
telligently. -;-
The problem now was, How could a man
possessing a small fund of knowledge
make a profit out of five or ten acres ot
land? Intelligence on the farm was as
necessary to a successful result as in any
other employment.
In the selection of land it was very im
portant to make sure of an abundant
water supply. Diversity in tbe land
scape, not inconsistent with tbe needs of
cultivation, was also durable. Good
land could be Doug it for $30 and $40 an
acre, and she estimated that a capital of
$1800 to begin with was sufficient on a
holding of about ten acres. She cau
tioned her hearers, however, not to invest
in any more livestock than was abso
lutely necessary.
"Select your land in October," she ad
vised, "when nature speaks more truth
fully. By January the buildings will be
ready for occupancy and work can begin
in the spring. Prepare the soil by plow
ing thoroughly until it is like ashes and
plant it with oats, wheat and alfalfa. The
young grain can he used for forage.
"Plant eucalyptus trees freely for your
future supply of fuel and in February
prepare your kitchen garden, planting it
with vegetables aud small fruits. In
March you can begin to keep poultry. If
you are not thoroughly versed in this
branch of farming do not buy more than
half a dozen birds at the outset. Poultry
farming demands great knowledge of de
tails, but given that knowledge there are
few other pursuits which yield more suc
cessful results." , .... ,
Mr. Holman said that he desired to offer
a resolution looking to the organization of
a permanent farmers' club in San Fran
cisco, as it was one of the purposes of
i ese meetings that such an organization
should be their final outcome. Clubs of
this kind- existed in New York, Philadel
phia and other ci ies, their scope being as
various as the places in which they were
found. The club in New York was com
posed of land-owners and fancy farmeis.
whose investigations bad little reference
to tbe question of profit. In Philadelphia
its object was much tbe same, most of its
members being well-to-do.
It was a well-known fact that there
were more farmers in the County of San
Francisco than in any other part of Cali
fornia. Many of these had settled here
after acquiring comfortable fortunes.
Others held land lor speculative purposes
and others continued to farm in order to
keep alive the memories of their youth.
It had been suggested that such people,
owing to their central location, their
wealth, their connection with all kinds of
affairs, their familiarity with the market
and the processes of legislation, might by
combined action accomplish avast deal
for the betterment of agricultural interests
in California. Tnis might be done in a
honsand ways.
Unjust taxation he referred to as a
grievance these ciubs miirht seek to rem
edy. A land-owner of his acquaintance in
Solano Connty had assured nini that his
farm was taxed 40 per cent more than tbe
price at which a single acre had been sold
in that locality for five years.
A satisfactory market, he argued, was
of primary importance. A farmers' club
would facilitate the exchange and dissemi
nation of fresh information. Ti.e farmers
of California' failed to profit by the recent
rise in wheat because, though the circum
stances which led up to it were known to
a few persons here and to the department
at Washington, there was no way in which
that knowledge could be conveyed to those
most vitally interested. If there had been
a strong farmers' club here, with special
sources of information, tbe farmers would
nave been benefited tothe extent of a sum
he hesitated to name.
He moved for the appointment of a com
mittee of seven persons to take up this
matter, create an organization by draft
ing a constitution and by- laws, and can
vass for membership.
The motion was carried out and the fol
lowing committee subsequently ap
pointed: H. H. Taylor. J. G. James,
Alfred Holman, Colonel E. A. Denicke, P.
B. Cornwall, B. P. Flint and Edward F.
Adams.
Professor E. J. Wickson of the agricul
tural department, of the University of
California afterward addressed the meet
ing on the work accomplished by the de
partment.
The majority of those present, of whom
many were ladies, handed in their names
aa prospective members of the Farmers'
Club. .

EX-MINISTER
FROM HAWII
Thurston Says Nearly
Everybody Now Wants
Annexation.
Club pf Over Six Thousand
Members Organized in
Honolulu
Does Not Knew Whether He Will
Go to Washington â Is Attorney
for Mrs. Dimonl
Hon. LÂ«. A. Thurston of the Hawaiian
Islands, formerly Minister from Hawaii to
Washington, and who has filled many po
litical positions in that country, including
membership in the Cabinet, arrived here
on the Alameda yesterday, and is at the
Occidental. He is accompanied by Mr-.
Thurston and their little child.
It is two years now since Mr. Thurston
was in this country. But that period has
made no change in him, save to add a
short beard of ebony darkness. It will be
remembered that his withdrawal as Min
ister was through a dogmatic order of
Gresham. The ex-Minister is here for a
month's stay. He says he has not yet
formulated bis plana, and does not know
whether he shall go on East and visit
Washington and other places, or not.
Mrs. Thurston's former home is in Michi-
gan.
Mr. Thurston . says there is now a
stronger feeling than ever in Hawaii in
favor of annexation. After it was seen,
he recounts, that Cleveland would do
nothing toward annexation, the feeling in
Hawaii was allowed to die down, but now
the Annexation Club has a membership
of about 6000. Mr. Thurston is president
of this club. . '
â¢'Not only has the club 60C0 members,"
said he, "but at Koolan, fifteen miles from
Honolulu, there is a club of eighty mem
bers, all but two of whom are native Ha
waiians. A creat many natives are also
members of the club at Honolulu, and are
strongly in favor of annexation. J. L.
Kaulukou, ex-Marsha? and ex-Attorney-
General of Hawaii, who has always
been a strong royalist, is now an ardent
annexationist. In various places on the
islands the natives are iavoring annexa
tion.
"In short, the natives are for it because
they believe it is the only salvation against
the Japanese. There is a good deal of feel
ing about this. A Japanese man-of-war
was expected to arrive a little while before
I left, but il seems the fears of those who
anticipated it were not well founded.
"Ttie census had just been completed
when we came away. It showed this as
to population: Total half caste and
mixed. 8000; native, 31,000; Japanese, 24,
--000; Chinese, 21.Q00. and Whites 25,000,
making a total of 109,000. The whites in
clude Americans, English, Germans,
French, Italians and Portuguese.
"No, I do not come in an official capa
city to work for annexation. I do not
.represent the Government. I hold no
official position, hut if there is anything
that can be done by me in my pres
ent position I am prepared to do it."
Mr. Thurston, Paul Neumann and W. L.
Stanley are attorneys for Mrs. W. W.
Dimond in the divorce suit that is now
pending. He says the case will probably
be tried during his absence. He rays his
trip has nothing to do with getting any
evidence for his fair client.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po!n s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature, The
word "hiirh" means high barometric pressure and
ls usually accomoanled by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
ami accompanied by cloudy weather and - rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low"- ls inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winder. The reverse of these conditions
will produce anVpposite result.

903 Broadway, Feb. 11. J
Frank O'Connor and Harry Baker, two
respectable young men of San Leandio,
were arrested the other night by a man
who appeared to be a tramp, but who i
proved to be a Constable. The two young j
fellows were placed under arrest for being
vagrants, and after they had proved, to
the satisfact.on of the ambitious Constable
that they were young men who stood high
in the community they were reluctantly
"released; but they have not dropped the
matter.
i Constable Black of Fruitvale is the man
'â A who made the unfortunate mistake. When
\Biack goes gunning for tramps and the
- consequent mileage and fees he disguises
himself. HÂ« puts on an old suit of
clothes, throws a blanket over his shoulder
and in the genuine garb of the "hobo" he
saunters along the creeks aud favored
spots of Eden Township where tramps are
likely to he found.
This ruse of his has been very success
ful; out on the occasion of the arrest of
O'Connor and Baker it may get the ambi
tious Constable into trouble. The lens de
clare t:iat they were simply walking by
â  the creek, as respectably as any citizen
â  could, when Black suddenly pounced on
them and placed them under arrest. It
was necessary for them to go into San
' Leandro and have themselves thoroughly
ident.tied before the Constable could be
- persuaded that be had made a mistake.
The residents of San Leandro are not at
all satisfied with tnese amp excursions.
They di clare that Constable Wellman,
who employs Black as a deputy, was
elected by the Populist vote, and that
part of their platform was mat a man was
not a criminal because he could not ob
tain honest employment. A lew weeks
ago Back had two tramps unaer arrest,
and when crossing the railroad track he
â¢ slipped, and a bowie-knife which he had
' stuck in bis belt ran into bis hip and
caused a very serious wound. Instead of
making their escape, as they might easily
have done, one of the tramps ran to Hay
wards and flagged a train and thus pre
vented Back irom bleeding to death. The
trip on which the San Leandro youths
were arrested was ihe first after Black was
abie to be out, by r ason oi his injury,
â " and in the matter of fees it dees not ap
pear that he fared any better than on his
former unlucky trip.
WISH TO SELL CHURCH
IS widish Methodists to Leave
* Their Pioneer House of
Worsh p.
Will Move to Pretenious Quarters
N ar the Center of the
t City.
Oakland Office San Fraxcisco Call,)
. " 908 Broadway, Feb. 11 f
After an existence of thirteen years the
Swedish Methodist Episcopal church,'
which has for a long time been worship
ing in a remote part of town, has become
sufficiently strong, financially and numer
itally, to justify it locating near the center
of the city. It has petitioned the Superior
Court for permission to sell its property at
Tenth and Center streets, so that it can
purchase the First Chris. Church at
. Thirteenth and Market streets.
About thirteen years ago nil the Swedes,
Norwegians and Danes who worshiped
under the banner of Methodism united in
one congregation and worshiped in a little
church on Market street. After a time
the Swedish element separated from the !
rest and laid the spiritual foundation of
. the present church in a little room in the
rear of the Second Congregational Church %
Mr. Elniing, a local preacher, was the
first pastor, and he was succeeded by Rev.
Mr. Sandnolt. During the iatter's mm
istry the lot where their church now
stands was purchased, and soon afterward
the church was erected.
" ,At fir.' t tbe new church had twenty-five
members, and under the care of Rev. Mr.
Carlanuer it reached its height. Then
c: me Rev. â¢ Mr. Liijegren, whose sensa
tional divorce trial ended in separating
â¢ from his wile, known as the "Swed
ish Nightingale," and this helped to in
jure the church. About the same time
. 4**Â« Woodworm craze came along and tur
ner detracted from the church's progress.
â¢ Key. Mr. D vidson presided over the
.nhurch for the following year, and was the
first Swedish presiding elder of the dis
trict, which, being under the jurisdiction
of the American Bishop, had heretofore
been presided ov?r by an American elder.
â¢ The Rev. Mr. (berg, the present pas
tor, has built tiie church up rapidly until
it now has a large congregation, and their
hopes are all centered in purchasing the
First Christian Church, in which the
Swedish congregation expects to worship
about the firs;, of March.
The dedicatory ceremonies will be con
ducted by Bishop X-wman, who is a great
iavorite with the congregation.
The old church site has already found a
purchaser, and the Swedish Methodists
will complete the deal as soon as the two
churches interested obtain permission to
tell their respective properties.
The Rev Mr. Wahlberg has already
planned to improve the new church by
planting palms around it, making a new
entrance and repainting. The present
trustees of the church are Messrs. Torn
blora, Nyhu, Herman, Lindgren and
Hawkins.
Exposition in Danger.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 11.â Early this
morning fire was discovered in the yard
of the Exposition building. The depart
ment turned out, when it was found that
the blaze had not done any serious dam
age and had originated by tbe firing of
some rubbish swept out of the building.
Had the flames not been discovered when
they were the dry old building would

'OAKLAND, Cal.. Feb. 11.â Principa!
McChesney of the. High School has isÂ«ued
an order prohibiting all rushes between
the senior classes within the precincts of
the school. The order takes effect next
Monday morning. &HQHG
The principal has received a promise
frn^n one of the classes that it would sac
rifice the delight of rushes for the sake of
the school, but the other class was obdu
rate, and said that rushing was one of
their rights. A compromise has therefore
baen effected between the principal and
the class. Be ween 3:45 o'clock Tbursdav
afternoon and 8:45 Friday morning, and
between- 3:45 Friday afternoon and 8:45
Monday morning, the two classes must
settle all feuds, past, present or future.
Outside of these limits rushing is abso
lutely prohibited.
A DISASTER AVERTED.
Fire Caused by 1 lectricitv in the Me
chanics' Building at the State
University.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 11.â Another
disaster by fire at the State University
similar in cause and effect but involving
greater risk to life and property than the
one of two days ago was barely prevented
this afternoon. Homer Parker, a student
in the department of mechanical engin
eering, in turning on the heavy circuit of
electricity placed the plug in the wrong
terminal on the switchboard. This error,
which was caused on account of the dark
ness in the room, produced directly the
opposite effect on the rheostat from that
de? red, with the result that 1000 volts of
the electric fluid was diverted on to the
wrong wire.
This caused the sparks to fly in every
direction from the resistance-box, and
soon the box and switchboard were ablaze.
Before water could be turned on from the
hydrant in the interior of the building the
entire wall within the switchboard in
closure was ablaze, completely destroying
the resistance-box, the switchboard itself
and a number of small conducting wires.
Had the alternator been in use when tbe
stieam of water was turned on the burn
ing re-istance-box the student holding the
hose would have been electrocuted, as the
current would have reached him through
tbe water and up the hose with almost
the same force as if he held in his hand a
live wire transmitting a thousand voltage
current. .-.....;
The damage to the apparatus and build
ing is m the neighborhood of $100.
Going to the Debate.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 11.â party
of seventy-five students will leave to-mor
row afternoon for Palo Alio to attend the
Carnot debate which will be held at Stan
ford University to-morrow evening. Most
of tbem will remain for the nignt, while
some will take the late train, returning
to San Francisco about midnight.
The three debaters from Berkeley,
Marks, Fryer and Overstreet â are in
readiness lor the combat of words, and
they promise the Stanford boys a hard
struggle. They *eeni determined that the
! medal shall go to Berkeley again tbis
year, as it did last.
. Drenched With Vitriol.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 11.â C. L. Gil
man, foreman of the supply department
of the chemistry building at the State
University, narrowly escaped a horrible
death this morning. While carrying a
carboy of concentrated sulphuric acid, or
oil of vitriol, from the street into the
storeroom he slipped on the stone floor
and dropped the glass yes-el, receiving she
greater part of its contents on his trousers
and shoes. A number of students who
! were standing near by saw what had oc
! cur and turned the hose on Gilman,
I thus neutralizing ihe vitriol and prevent
i ing it from burning through to the skin.
i Had it not been for their timely action
j Gilman would probably have been burned
!to death. As it was he escaped without
severe injury beyond a considerable scare,
but with the loss of his shoes and troupers,
which were utterly eaten up. ,
In Secret Session.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. Feb. 11.â The Board
of Trustees met in executive S'ssion to
night and ussed the proposition of
water rates for the ensuing year. Tbe
laundry ordinance was also thoroughly
discussed. The latter is intended to com
pel the Chinese in business to g t out of
town, but it is a question whether this can
be done without driving out all laundries.
The City Attorney was called upon to de
cide the matter. The Trustees also con
sidered City Electrician Wiese's report
upon the cost of supplying the narrow
gauge mole with Incandescent lights. The
figures will be submitted to the railroad
company.

Not the Only Burglar.
OAKLAND. Cal.. Feb. 11.â The arret
of John Evans bas not been followed, as
was expected, by a cessation of burglaries.
Lust nicht the thief who entered the
Juanita Hotel Monday came back and fin
ished tne job of visiting the rooms. Sev
eral small sums were tasen from clothing
hanging in the wardrobes and some jew
elry is also missing. Two strange men
were seen in the house, but no one knows
who they were.
The hand of the man of average size is
six to eight inches in length; that of the
woman from ] to \% inches smaller.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 11.â The immense foundations for the elaborate Old Ladies' Home, planned by Sister Superior Russell of San Francisco, have been com
pleted over a year at Frultvale, and now that the period of depression which has settled over the country for the past two years is passing off it is hoped tbat the
necessary funds can be raised to complete the building. Wh%nit was started there was a prospect thai by the time th foundations were completed enough money
would be in hand to go ahead with the work, but the great desire of Sister Superior Russell received a check from untoward circumstances, and work was discon-
Unued, as it was not considered advisable to incur financial responsibility. One of those most interested in the home said yesterday tint the elaborate foundation
presents a standing appeal to those who are wasting money lavishly on all manner of social functions to place a little of their wealth where it would benefit
their fellow-beings.

COMPLICATIONS
Two Fire Chiefs in Berke
ley Where There Should
Be One.
. . .
Ott Appointed to a Position
Which Seems Never to Have
Been Vacant.
McClain, Who Has Been in Office Ten
Years, R.ses and Demands an
Explanation.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. ILâ fire
chief agitation bas taken a new and un
expected turn, and now the Board of Trus
tees is confronted by the prospect of a suit
Joseph McClain, Who Has Been Fire Chief for Ten Years, and
August L. Ott, Who Was Elected Fire Chief a Few-
Nights Ago. Both Claim the Office
for back salary alleged to be owing to the
old incumbent of the office.
The appointment of A. L. Ott has roused
Joseph McClain, who was made chief ten
years ago, and who declares that he is chief
yet and proposes to find out why a suc
cessor was summarily appointed without
notification to him.
"I don't propose to have them ride over
me like that," said McClain to-day. "I
was appointed fire chief ten years ago and
have never resigned, nor have I been no
tified of my removal from office. For four
years I served at a salary of $10 per
month. Then I worked for nothing, never
drawing my salary. Now there is six
years' pay due me, and unless the town
board i ays me or makes some explanation
I shall put my claim in the hands of an
attorney.
"Simply because I have not been mak
ing demands for my salary is no reason
why it should be decided that I have not
been serving. I have acted as chief and
have turned out to every fire, and do not
propose to stand the treatment I have re
ceived."
McClain was appointed under the old
ordinance organizing a lire department.
The present Board of Trustees have passed
a new law creating a department. The
records of tbo town do not show that Mc
clain's resignation was ever offered, or
that be has ever been formally removed
from office.
In the scramble of candidates for the
office the tact has been entirely over
looked that McClnin was still chief of tne
department. The passage of anew law re
creating the Fire Department of Berkeley
repeals the old ordinance and thus invali
dates the old appointment of McCain.
He proposes accordingly to bring the
matter up at the next meeting of the Town
board with a view of righting matters.
Meanwhile Chief Ott. who was appointed
last Tuesday night, is assuming control of
tbe department and is planning for its
improvement.
Buried in a Sewer.

MAEOH OF CHRISTIANS.
Unique Parade in Connection With the
Munball Itevtval.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. ILâ To-morrow
evening the great street parade of young
Christians, which originated with and has
been engineeied by Evangelist Munball,
will take place. All the young people's
societies of the various churches will
unite in a unique religious demonstra
tion.
This is the first attempt to have a Chris
tian Endeavor parade in California, and
Dr. Munball, who is always on the look
out for original methods which can be
made to serve a good purpose, has ar
ranged for ihis parade to he one of the
features of the present revival.
Members will gather at the First Meth
odist Church and will march down Four
teenth street to Washington, down Wash
ington to Seventh and along to Broadway,
where they will march to Fourteenth
street again and along to the Presbyterian
Church. The procession will start
promptly at 7 o'clock, so as to be at the
church in time for the meeting at 7:30.
The St. John's Church Boys' Brigade
Drum Corps will head the line, and will
be followed by the pastors of the various
churches. Then will come the different
societies, eac < marching by itself, under
its own banner.
A great effort is beine made to have JOCO
people in line, and it is believed this can
be attained. While the members are
marching along the street they will sing
special songs.

THROUGH GROVE STREET.
Hayes Valley Improvers Contemplate
a I', lÂ«- vin d to the Park.
The members of the Hayes Valley Im
provement Club have taken bold of a
scheme to open Grove street through
Alamo square.
. At the meeting held in Mowry's Hall
Wednesday this scheme, which has been
contemplated for years, assumed some
thing like a definite form.
Casper Zwieriein, on being called upon
for an opinion as tothe probable cost of
grading Grove street from Steiner to Scott,
a distance of two blocks, staled that pur
suant to the resolution passed by tbe Su
pervisors in 1&90, at which the opening of
the street had been authorized, it was
stipulated that tbe grade should conform
to that of the park, since which time the
park bad been cut down to grade; conse
quently the expense would not be large
and could be easily met by the property
owners on the street.
A committee was appointed to obtain
the co-operation of the persons owning
property on that street. It is composed
of W H. Middlehorffe, Armour McLaugh
lin, A. Parker, J. Peters, C. Zwierlein and
William Currier. They wiil prepare a
prospectus and have it delivered to each
property-owner from Larkin to Baker
streets, and at the same time will invite
them to attend the next meeting of the
cinb, when final action will be taken upon
this undertaking.
A. A. Reiter spoke upon the necessity of
having Grove street declared a boulevard,
over which p-rsons can go direct to
Golden Gate Park without the necessity
of having to cross any of the streets over
which str?Gtcars now travel.
These ideas meet with the unanimous
approval of the members of the club.
WANT A STATUE
FOR ALVARADO
San Pablo Wants Honor for
the Ex- Governor From
the Native Sons.
Contra Costa County Evidently
Thinks the Legislature Should
Make an Appropriation.
Made History on This Soil Before
California Was Accepted as a
State.
Oakland Office San Fbancibco Call.)
90S Broadway, Feb. 11. J
The residents of San Pablo are desirous
of seeing a monument erected in' some
suitable portion of this State to perpetuate
the memory of ex-Governor Juan Ban
tlsta Aivarado, student, soldier and
Governor, who died fourteen years ago at
his home in the city that is now anxious
to honor mm. "."r.
The idea was suggested by the effort
now being made to btain an appropria
tion for the erection of a statue to Colonel
Baker in Golden Gate Park. The resi
dents of San Pablo say that they do not
object to the raising oi a monument to
Colonel Baker, Robert Burns or any other
worthy or illustrious dead, but they do be
lieve that those who have bad the good
fortune to have been born here should show
their appreciation of the men wbo helped
to develop tbis State, and who figured
prominently in its early history, before
they take steps to honor men of other
nations, whose connection with California
is but general.
A. Dalton Jr., the editor of the Contra
Costa News, is advocating the Aivarado
memorial. "California is but a young
State," said he, "and its history dates
back but a short period prior to its admis
sion in 1850. For thirty years before that
date there was no man in California better
known or more respected and honored
than Juan B. Aivarado. His memory
should be honored by the erection of a
statue in Golden Gate* Park, or some other
place; and 1 desire to call the attention of
all native sons to this matter, and trust
that toey will seriously consider it and
take immediate steps to have erected a
suitable monument to a native Californian
who figured so prominently. There are
many native sons in the State Legislature
who sbould endeavor to obtain an appro
priation for such a purpose.
"When ex-Governor Aivarado died the
Society of California Pioneers passed
some resolutions which should find an
abiding place at the base of such a monu
ment. He was born in California long be
fore the American occupation was thought
of. After the treaty of 1348 he cheerfully
accepted the new order of things and be
came and ever remained a faithful Ameri
can citizen. The ground on w ich the
church and schoolhouse stand in San
Pablo was a gift from the deceased to the
parish, and his remains now repose in
Mountain View Cemetery. The story of
his life is tbat of a brave man under whose
rule this territory flourished, end native
sons should delight in honoring him."
MAY MODIFY THE RULE-
Regulation Concerning -Measles the Sub
ject of Some Inquiry and Discuidion.
The Board of Health may modify its
regulation concerning the exclusion of
children from school lor a period of thirty
days upon the showing that measles or
other contagious disease has existed in
the family. The present rule is that no
child residing in the family or in the
same house where a contagious disease
has been shall be permitted to attend
school "until the Health Officer certifies
that a period of tnirty days' probation has
ended."
The modification may ba in favor of
measles, which disease has afflicted
several hundreds of children in the past
six weeks. In a large family one child
could hardly recover before another came
down. The child who has recovered fir*,
is shut out for thirty days on his or her
own account, and may possibly be shut
out another thirty days on account of
other members of the same family. The
matter has caused much inquiry by
parents. â¢
IMPROVING ALAMO SQUARE.
Plan Suggested by Mr. McLaren Which
Will -Vake the Ground Ornamental.
John McLaren has filed with the Board
of Supervisors his plan for the improve
ment of Alamo Square. He reports that
he has provided two good places where
visitors' may be protected from tho wind.
He proposes to take advanta c of a bank
near the east end of the square to plant
a.onir its entire length a cypress hedge,
and behind the hedge he will groun pines,
eucalyptus and cypress trees. In front of
this will be an area of gravel, which will,
in time, form a mcclv protected play
ground for children. By a small amount
of cut and by planting the hedge and
trees, a very good shelter will be formed.
Mr. McLaren suggests a system of drain
age, which provides for sloping the ground
from every point upward toward the cen
ter of the tquare, with steps at the en
trances where the slopes are too steep to
admit of a tood walk. He also proposes a
plan for watering the square, and says
that the square can be made quite an or
nament to t c surrounding neighborhood
at a comparatively low cost.
LOUIS JAMES TO' AID.
Elaborate Preparations for the Girls'

An Old Controversy Urged With
Considerable Warmth
Yesterday.
Oae of tbe Many Subjects Tbat Gay
the Street Committee a Fall
Day of Work.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors bad a large, not to say enthu
siastic crowd of petitioners to listen to
yesterday afternoon. Eloquence ran riot
and many thoughts and facts concerning
Liberty Hill grade were presented forthe
consideration of the Supervisors. The
property-owners and residents were pres
ent by scores. Attorneys argued and
property-owners explained.
The story of Lberty Hill has been told
sc often and so acrimoniously that the lo
cality has sometimes been called "Battle
HilL" New tacts were presented yester
day. The room grew warm with the heat
of those who argued for and against the
grade which has been proposed. The rep
resentatives of tbe Association of Im
provement Clubs were present. Mr. Mul
lany made earnest and humorous re
marks. Mr. Sherer was earnest. Several
ladie-. spoke.
Finally, after the committee had lis
tened three hours, the matter was taken
under consideration, the committee prom
ising to visit tbe locality â Sanchez street.
Tne" improvement clubs have asked that
the street be opened through.
A great deal of routine business was
transacted by the committee yesterday.

Adolph Sutro spoke at some length con
cerning the improvement of the district
south of Golden Gate Park. In his opin
ion no sewers should be built in that sec

Judge Carroll Cook Sustains the Beei-
slon of Judge Conlan.
Judge Carroll Cook yesterday affirmed
the decision of Judge Conlan in declaring
Catherine Sweet guilty of disturbing the
peace. In -rendering judgment JuJge
Cools said: ''This case comes to this court
upon appeal irom the Police Court of this

maliciously and willfully disturbs the
peace or quiet of any person by, among
other things, tumultuous or offensive con

"The various provisions of the section
are laid in the disjunctive, and constitute

Bastheim and Will
Lubin.
One Hundred Young People

Scott's Dance.
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Mils Enter
tained to Honor Miss Levert
From New Orleans.
Miss Helen Bastheim, eldest daughter
of Joseph Bastheim. and Will Lubin, a
popular and prosperous young business
man of Los Aneeles, were married last
evening, at 8 o'clock, at the residence of
the bride's parents, 2126 California street.
Only relatives witnessed the ceremony,
which was performed by Rev. Dr. Voor
sancer of the Temple Emanu-EI.
The bride was attended by her sister,
.Miss Hattie Bastheim, who officiated as
maid of honor. The groom was unat- '
tended.
A carload of orange blossoms had been
sent by friends in Southern California for
the bride and the fragrant blossoms were
u^ed with artistic discretion in the
decoration of tbe home.
For the drawing-room these flowers were
fashioned into a bower ana here the young
couple stood while they repeated the words
that made them one.
The bride wore an elegant gown of white
satin tulle. The jiape was of the satin and
perfectly plain. Trie corsage was of tulle
and destitute of all trimming save a few
sprays of natural lilies of the valley.
These same delicate blossoms fastened
' he veil to the coiffure and formed the
jridal bouquet.
Miss Hattie Bastheim wore a dainty
gown of white organdie over white silk
and trimmed with pink ribbons. She car
ried a bouquet of bridesmaid roses.
Mrs. Bastheim, mother of the bride,
wore an elegant gown of lavender velvet
trimmed with duchesse lace.
Mr. and Mrs. Lubin will make their
home in Los Angeles.
One hundred young folk were the guests
of Mr. and Mrs. Henry T. Scott last even
ing at their home on Laguna street. This
affair was the only large private dance of
the season, and toe invited guests donned j
their grandest apparel in honor of the ;
affair. .
The dance was given for Miss Cunning- j
ham, Miss Helen Hopkins and Miss Caro |
Crockett, three of this season's mosl pop- j
ular debutantes. The brilliant ballroom'
was cay with flowers, and dancing to ex
cellent music was in order until midnight,
when an elaborate supper was served.
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Mills and Miss
Delia Mills gave a musicaieat ti.eir home,
2800 Jackson street, last evening in honor
of Miss Levert of New Orleans, who for
the past month has been visiting Miss
Mary Stubbs.
The musical programme was an unusu
ally excellent one. Among the contribu
tors were Miss Mary Mann, Mrs. Richard
Bayne, Miss Marie son, Fred Gregg,
the Berkeley Giee Club and Miss Mills.
After the music there was a supper for 125.

The third quarterly report of the eleventh

es:, branch of the A. O. F., Friendly Society,
has been issued. This shows that during the
quarter there have been paid six death claims,
making a total of fifteen since the last-held
annual session. On the subject of finance the
report says:
Our common annual session will entaT consid
erable ex pei so, which the amount paid for per i
capita will not be sufficient to meet; at our last !
session th- iuner.il :uno was drawn upon to meet
tbe payment of mileage to delegates: this we have
returned 10 the funeral fund; as the per capita tax
was reduced for the present term, it can be read
ily seen that we will have 10 adopt some measure
to meet the necessary expense attached to our
coming session. 1 lie mil ig has been made b.
your executive .board that no circle will be en
titled to uil.eace for Its delegate unless all amounts
owing by said eire c to tne .-upreme Grand Circle

Last Monday evening Beulah Chapter at
South San Francisco while in session received
a visit from Grand Secretary Kate J. Willats
and a delegation from Golden Gate Chapter
and one from Mission . Chapter, U. D. There
was a warm welcome for the visitors, and after
some time had been spent in listening to ad
dresses there was a visit to the banquet hall,
where an elegant collation was spread in hon
or of the visitors, and an hour was pleasantly
passed. Beulah is away from the city's cen
ter, but it has many enthusiastic and energetic

Golden Gate Camp No. 64, Woodmen of the
World, at its meeting last Monday initiated

meetings are well attended and great interest
is manifested in the work of the order. The
members are striving to obtain first place and
be classed the "banner camp." Golden Gate
Camp will soon receive a visit from F. A.
Falkenburg, head consul of the Pacific Coast
jurisdiction.
SPECIAL AGENTS HERE.
Two Treasury Official! Are Looking
Into the Affairs of the Custom-
House.
The special agents of the treasury who
have come to this coast to assist Special
Agent Moore in the checking up of Cus
tom-bouse accounts have begun their
work, and were closeted with Mr. Moore
all day yesterday preparing for the vast
amount of work that is before them.
The rumors that Collector Wise and
Deputy Surveyor Ruddell are under fire
from Washington receive little credence
in the Custom-house. Most of the officials
there say that the visit is nothing more
than the regular routine inspection and
that the treasury agents will return to
Washington after that is finished.
Others, however, think that the inquiry
will co deeper and that opium ttansac-
Hous and the landing of Chinese will be
probed deeply, with, perhaps, sensational
developments. '
The agents are extremely reticent, and
thus far have only paid a casual visit to
the Custom-house to call on the various
officials.

business for srle, and in order to effect a quicc
deal am wiling to make a great sacrifice and givW
some one agr-at btrgaln and finest business Â°_*
Pacific Coast for almost nothing You may tliin&e*
it strange (and so It is) that after 16 years of valvP
able experience 'In the business, havi g snent
ibousauds of dollars In advertising and traveled
the State over with horse and ou-gy inspecting
and appraising nearly every ranch ou the Pacific
Coast, and now having secured . the aeency of
about 3000 cho'ce rroperties offered for sale and
exchange, earned $30,000 commissions l.i last five
years, still I've rea ly decided to sell everythinj
just as it stands, Including my enormous list of ac
curate y written descriptions, together withal* con-
tracts, complete set of blanks specially designei
and printed set of books, diagrams, irops, hun-
dreds of I hotographs , thousands of letters, ,Ist of
prospective purchasers.- all furniture, eta,
in fact, the most complete and best system-
atized LAND AGENCY IB AMERICA, occupying

p rt'ect co. dltion and , though having cost thou,
sands of dollars and years of hard work all gees
tor a few hundred dollars, which s.. oud easily hi,
made back from deals now In progress within one
mouth. In conclusion. I wit! 3ay that as the nusi
ness is simple 10 conduct and prospects were never
better any wideawake business roan can take my
piace and make much more in the future than I
have in the past. Pl-asant, profitable and genteel,
with unlimited possibilities. Tboiough investtÂ£_>

CUBA'S CAUSE
HAS FRIENDS
Mayor Phelan Will Name
Many Local Commit
teemen.
HUNDREDS OF MAYORS
AT WORK.
i
The Cuban League of New York
Is Unifying the Friends
of Freedom.
MANY LOCAL PATRIOTS ARE IN
EARNEST.
Thoughtful Men Express Themselves
on tbe Subject and Agree to Act
on the Committee. â¢
The work of organizing a local league of
prominent men who sympathize with the
Cubans in their struggle for liberty is
progressing without interruption day by
day.
Mayor Phelan will heartily co-operate
with the New York League, of which
Colonel Ethan Allen is president, by ap
pointing a committee at an early date.
"I received . another letter from the
league headquarters in New York," said
Mayor Phelan yesterday, "and I shall
appoint the desired committee, as they re
quest, as soon as I am furnished a list of
names of men willing to serve. As 1 un
derstand it this league is rot urging our
Government to recognize the belligerents,
but it is organized for the purpose of show
ing that the sentiment of Americans is for
freedom in every land."
The following is the letter received by
Mayor Phelan yesterday :
New York. February 4, 1897.
Hon. .Taints D. Phelan, San Francisco, Cat. â
Dear Bib: a few days since we wrote to you
and the Mayors of 700 other cities of the
United States, requesting tne naming of a
committee of prominent citizens who would
organize a branch of the Cuban League of the
United States. We are receiving most satisfac
tory responses to those letters from all sec
tions ot the Republic. In no instance have
we receive- a refusal from a Mayor to
accede to cur request. The sentiment In favor
ol the independence of Cuba, from the reports
we are receiving, appears to be universal
throughout the country. Our desire is to give
such expression to this sentiment as will jus
tify the executive to take prompt action
to end ihe campaign of murder and destruc
tion now being carried on In that island at
our very door.
If you have not already sent us the names of
the committee for organization in your City
will yoj kindly do so at once? as we desire
that every city in the land should have a
share in promoting the cause of human liberty
in Cuba.
Again, will you Kindly hand inclosed clip
ping to just the right "lady in your City, with
the request that she will appoint other ladles
who, associated with her, can and will organ
ize entertainments as those representative
ladies of New York are doing?. Please request
her to report to us the progress she makes.
We shall be pleased to render them such aid
as we can.
It is apparent to all thoughtful observers
that Spain has not the power to crush the
Cuban patriots, and therefore the continuance
01 the cruel struggle in Cuba can only serve
to prolong a sense of abasement and humilia
tion in tbe minds ol all men who are confident
that this Republic has the power to end It,
end is in honor called upon to do so for the
highest good of all the parties directly con
cerned. Very truly yours,
Francis Way land Gi.en, Secretary.
The following citizens have already sig
nified their willingness to serve on the
committee and the Mayor will notify them
of their appointment in a few days. It is
the purpose io withhold the formal ap
pointment until the full preliminaries are
arranged, but the names subjoined will be
prominent among the committeemen:
Ex-Mayor Adolph Sutro.
General W. H. L. Barnes.
Colonel W. C. little.
William E. Bunker.
L. P.. Eliert.
James H. Barry. .
A. P. Van Duzer.
1 isln-r Ames.
. H. E. Highton.
Charles M. Sh>irtridge.
"William H. Mills.
Daniel A. McColgan.
A. Kuef.
J. E. tarry.
W. D. Crow.
General Edward S. Salomon.
Judge E. It. Garber.
Secretary Mascherini is busy making ar
rangements lor the organization of the lo
cal league on broad lines to fully co-oper
ate with similar bodies organized in other
cities throughout the Union.
"I am in receipt of a message from New
York,'' said Mr. Mascherim yesterday,
"stating that the movement is not only
growing all over the United States, but
over the world as well. A recent cable
gram from the city of Rome shows that
the party of Cuban sympathizers there is
gaining strength every day.
"I continue to get letters from all parts
of the coast showing full sympathy with
oar plans. While prominent citizens
favor the movement we also get letters
from the masses, and they are just as much
in interest as any others."
The following expressions from the
gentlemen interviewed show the general
drift of opinion:
A. P. Van Duzerâ l am heartily in favor
of the movement. I believe in liberty in |
every country, and it seems to me that
public sentiment here might _ive great
moral support to the cause of the op
pressed.
Colonel W. C. Littleâ Jones and Mas
cherini deserve credit for the work tney
have done. lam glad the Mnyor is going
to co-operate with the liberal citizens of
oiher States in this movement. 1 shall be
pleased to aid the movement in any way I
can.
Attorney Edward S. Salomon â As an
old Grand Army man I cannot refuse to
express my sentiments. lam for the side
of Cuba. Those people are making a des
perate struggle for liberty and they are
entitled to all the aid we can give them.
Ex-Mayor Adolph Sutro â My sympa
thies go out to the Cubans, and while I do
not want to lead a movement or become
an active worker, I am willing to do what
I can for the cause of the oppressed.
W. E. Bunkerâ As one of the Sons of
the American Revolution, I am willing to
aid the revolutionists in Cuba. The
movement otiifht to ba fostered, and I am
glad committees are organizing here.
Every eood citizen ought to do all he can
to nid the oppressed. -
H. E. Hightonâ While I believe Cleve
land's message was sound doctrine rela
tive to the position this country ought to
take, and while I believe the â¢ belligerents
cannot expect to be recognized by our
Government, my svmnathies are all with
the Cubans, because I am a lover of lib
erty in every land.
Fisher Amesâ lt is a noble work. All
true friends of freedom will welcome the
effort now being made here. lam will
ing to sign the declaration of principles
put forth by the league.
W. H. Millsâ am for the greatest pos
sible liberty in this country and every
where. I lirmiv believe that no territory
on this hemisphere should ,oe subject to
the rule of royalty. ' Cuba is oppressed
and , needs our aid and moral support.
This is a good movement. -â¢â¢iÂ»
â¢ Attorney Daniel A. McColgan â I do not
see how any thorough American can re
fuse to subscribe to the principles of the
league.
A. Kuef â The very existence of a Cuban
league in this country shows that the tires
of liberty still burn. * I am for the league.
James H. Barryâ The Cuban League is
a good thing for every lover of liberty to
indorse. I'.s principles are those of the
purest and best Americanism.
The prospectus which the foregoing gen
tlemen have indorsed, and which will be
circulated for a few days, announces the
purposes of the organization, as set forth
by Colonel Ethan Allen and Charles A.
Dana. It runs as follows:
This league, composed only of American
citizens, was organized at a large and enthusi
astic meeting, held in the Fifth-avenue Hotel,
New York City, December 14, 1896.
The purposed the league was expressed in
the following resolution :
lUtolvcd. That ihlÂ» organization be called the
"Cuban league of the United stales," and that Its
purpose shall be to give practical consolidation to
the .sentiment of American citizens aud the moral
support- of the same In securing to Cuba, by all
legal means, the Inalienable right of self-govern
ment.
Tne following paragraph from the cen
tral league's appeal shows the general
spirit of the movement:
While we willingly give our sympathy in
words we should remember that there are
times when an empty hand carries no favor.
Such a time is the present, when the Cubans
stand in need of every necessary lor life and
exhaustive battles. They must, of course, be
drained of resources, which our people should
supply. Arms and ammunition, and, more
than these, food for hungry troops and people,
with medicines for their tick and wounded,
may be shipped to insurgent ports with full
permission of our statutes, since, with no
formal blockade against us, we may as freely
traffic there as with the ports of continental
Soain. To furnish these things, which may
legally be done, money becomes literally the
sinews of war. The league asks for subscrip
tions throughout the United states in aid ot
the patriots, which may be sent to Charles 11.
Denlson, the treasurer, Potter building, Park
row, New York City.
The Cuban League of the United States is or
ganized to give practical consolidation to the
sentiment of American citizens, and the moral
support of the same in securing to Cuba, by
all legal means, the inalienable right of self
government. It is proposed to so arouse pub
lic sympathy by mass-meetings and through
the press that recognition as an independcot
state shall be secured to the patriots.
The work of perfecting the local organ-

ization will probably be completed within
a few days. Mayor Phelan and the Cuban
leaders will hold another conference to
morrow, and a mass-meeting will be held
at an early date. ;. :
WIDE OP THE MARK-
A Few Bullets Fired on Account of a
Divorce Case.
Jacob L. Thurston, a carpenter, . is
charged with an attempt to commit mur
der.
At 2:30 o'clock yesterday morning he
mad: a target of George H. Pettis, a
printer, on Valley street and San Jose
avenue. Pettis was engaged in a game of
cards in a saloon when Thurston entered
and began abusing him. The two men
passed uncomplimentary epithets forqulte
a while, until Pettis started home, fol
lowed by Thurston. The latter, according
to Pettis, tried to shoot him, but the bul
lets went wide of the mark.
The trouble is the outcome of a divorce
suit which has been in the . courts for
nearly a year. Pettis is a stepson of one
Harrison, a defendant in the divorce suit,
and they are anything but friends. Thurs
ton and Harrison are friends, and Pettis
accuses them of conspiracy.
Judge Bahrs has cited Harrison to pnrge
himself to-day of contempt of court in the
matter still in court, and the breach be
tween the contending parties is widening.
The shooting is only one of the side issues
in the case.
THE M LEOD CASE.
Preliminary Examination of the De-
fend an t Commenced Yesterday.
The preliminary examination of Wil- ;
liam McLeod, ship's caiker, charged
with chokine his wife to death at 212 j
Cortland avenue on January 19. was com- |
menced before Judge Conlan yesterday.
Several witnesses were examined, the j
most important being Mrs. Ella Bates of j
Berkeley. She detailed how McLeod ;
came home, and, after abusing his wife j
for having him arrested tor battery, he :
knocked her down and choked her. Mrs.
McLeod got up, staggered into Mrs.
Gagen's house, next door, and expired in
a few minutes.
The case was continued till to-day,
when the defense will endeavor to prove
that Mrs. McLeod had b^en a sufferer
from heart disease, and that alone was the
cause of her death. The Coroner's jury
charged McLeod with manslaughter.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1897.
GIVEN TO
STUDENTS
Mrs. Lei and Stanford's
Generous Present to
the Public.
IT IS THE OLD FAMILY
MANSION.
The University Trustees For
mally Accept the Respon
sibility.
THE VALUABLE CONTENTS IN
CLUDED.
It Was the Wish of the Late Sen
ator â The Toner Regards It
as Her Horn?.
Mrs. Jane L. Stanford, widow of the late
Senator Leland Stanford, yesterday trans
ferred to the trustees of the Leland Stan
ford Jr. University the family mansion
situated at the southwest corner of Cali
fornia and Powell streets, to be held by
them in trust for the benefit of the stu
dents and the public. In makine the ,
deed in trust Mrs.' Stanford imposed cer
tain conditions that must be fulfilled.
This generous gift has been contem
plated for some time, maybe for years, for i
the lady stated that in doing so she was j
hut carrying out the well-known and ex- j
pressed wishes of her late husband.- Not
only did she give' the house and the .fifty:
vara- lot on which it stands, but the gift
includes the contents of the mansion,
consisting of many thousands of dollars
worth of works of art, statuary, mosaics,
a library full of rare books and its picture
gallery, which contains the products of
the brushes of many a well-known artist
in the Ola and New Worlds.
Mrs. Stanford reserves the right to the
premises for the remainder of her life.
White she has a beautiful residence in
Palo Alto and another in Washington,
D. C, still she holds dearest the mansion
on the hill.
For twenty-two years she has regarded
that place as her home. It was there that
she spent tbe happiest hours of her life
surrounded by her family and the memo
ries of the husband and son who have
passed to the other side of life still center
in the house- on the hill.
For a long time past Mrs. Stanford has
determined to dispose of the property in
the manner named, but in order that her
wishes might not miscarry she has taken
her time in arranging the conditions of
the transfer. When these were decided
â¢he informed the trustees of the univer
sity, and yesterday the latter held a
special m eeting in the Stanford mansion,
of which they formally accepted the trust.
Irving M. Scott presided. There were
present Trustees Goodall, Hnrkness,
Dodge. Belch, r, Taylor, Slo*s, McFarland,
Miller, Spaulding. Wilson, Stebbins,
Grant, Lieb, Lithron and Qiay. Mrs.
S:anford explained her intentions, wishes
and directions as to the purpose of the be
quest in this manner:
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Board of
Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University:
In deeding to you this home and its contents
this afternoon 1 am merely carrying out the
intentions of my beloved hast) nid and doing
what he would bave done bad I been first
called hence to the life eternal and be re
mained here alone. In his last will and testa
ment he distinctly and at some length ex
pressed such intention. Therefore, while lam
left alone to execute this deed, it is in fact the
deed of both of us. And since this is the first
opportunity 1 have had of bestowing by my
self a gift upon the students of the Leland
Stanford Junior University, I deem it proper
and fitting to give the trustees a few direc
tions in regard to the future work, which, in
the natural course of events, It must soon be
their duty to curry out as managers and re
sponslb.e custodians of that institution, but
which for the present, by the will of our
heavenly father, devolve* on me as sole sur
viving founder of the university.
In the first place 1 hope that the time may
come when this home, which is so dear to mc,
will be found useful as an affiliated college to
tne Leland Stanford Junior University or as a
library for the use of the students of the uni
versity and the community at large, and it
would rat ily me exceedingly if I could fill it
with books aud make it accessible to all. But
in Whatever manner It may te ultimately de
cided that this home be used I wish it to De
expressly understood that I direct that it be
devoted to the uÂ«es and service of the Leland
Staniord Junior University. and I direct and de
clare that it shall never be converted into a
clubhouse, a boarding-house or a place of un
dignified Amusement.
In the second place, let me sneak of the
honored president of the university. Every
year since his installment, his superior abili
ties, hit remarkable influence upon the
faculty and students, ! and in return their
fidelity and loyally to him, have filled- me
with gratitude. That one so able, so scholarly
and yet so approachable to all classes of so
ciety, so willing and ready to lecture and aid
all Institutions throughout the State, many
times making self-sacrifices to do so, should
be among us. I am sure has caused California
at large to feel that my husband was wisely
led when he selected him ior the position he
so ably fills. As for myself, I could say much
in his praise, ior he has tenderly and man
fully helped to lighten my burdens and as
sumes the cares and responsibilities of his po
sition without any complaint, fearing to add
to my cares.
I will only add that my earnest and sincere
prayer is that no circumstance may occur to
take him from his present position during the
years in which the responsibility still rests
upon me. And I would ike to think his con
nection with my husband in the past may
serve as a link that will bind him to the uni
versity for many years to come, wnen good old
age may still find him amid the scenes of dear
Palo Alto blessed and honored by the citizens
of California and the students and graduates
that go forth each year to fill their places in
life.
WhatJl am now about to say I have frequent
ly discussed with Dr. Jordan, but repeat it to
you because I. have been asked by several of
the trustees to Indicate to them some of my
wishes which it may be desirable for them to
carry out when they take upon themselves the
responsibilit es.
A subject I feel most reverentially under
obligation to touch upon, is one of a religious
nature. An impression exists in the minds of
many whose commendation and strengthen
ing prayers I need and seek, that the students
of the university are not directly taught to
reverence God and his wonderful works. It
was God's goodness to my husband and myself,
as evidenced in the many blessing* we received
from him, that umpired our hearts wltn grati
tude and gave birth to this university. It
seems to me, therefore, most proper and neces
sary that a reverence for God's name should
be one of the fundamental truths there ex
pounded. It was such a feeling that caused
my husband to direct during his lifetime, that
while no particul*r sect or creed should be
allowed to intrude on the university, there
should be taught therein "the immortality of
the soul, the existence of an all-wise and be
nevolent Creator, and that obedience to his
laws is the highest duty of man." 1 will here
quote his own written words to me on the
subject :
"Religion is intended as a comfort, a
solace, a necessity to the soul's welfare, and
whichever form of religion furnishes the
greatest comfort, the greatest solace, Is the
form which should be adopted, be its name
what it may. The best form of religion is trust
in God and a firm belief in the immortality of
the soul, life everlasting."
It is my direction that this vital and most
important fact be not lost sight or; that the
students when they enter the university be
taught that every one born on earth has a
soul-germ and that on its development de-
-. .._-:.-..,.' v,--. i-'s-.'ii'J â  â¢- .:â¢"â â¢
pends much in life here and everything In th â Â»
life eternal. Cultivating the soul intelligencd
will endow them with that which is beyon
all human-science and reveal to them God's
very self. Thomas a Kempis has said, "How
noble is. the soul of man; what wondrous
powers are hidden with it. It can find no rest
until it hath attained to the supreme good â
reached its aim; when once this is attained it
then'enjoyeth peace." Another well-known
writer has said, "Religion does not consist in
confession; it does not consist in repentance.
It consists only in the purity of the heart and
in the life of the individual."
And another says: "There is no narrowing
so deadly as the narrowing of roan's horizon
of spiritual things; no worse evil could befall
him in his course on earth than ' to lose sight
of heaven. And it is not civilization that can
prevent this: it is not civilization thatcau
compensate for it. No widening of science, no
possession of abstract truth can indemnify for
an enfeebled hold on the highest and central
truths of humanity. What shall a man give
in exchange for his soul?'' To teach this
means the simple truths taught by our great
est of all teachers, Jesus Christ.
In this connection 1 recall a statement made
to my husband and myself by the late Mark
Hopkins, president of Williams College, while
spending an evening at our home in Washing
ton in 1880. After reading aloud to us the
fourth chapter of Ephesiaus he remarked : "A
general observance of this chapter would civi
lize the world." I call your attention to this
remark because it was made by one of the lore
most educators of this country.
Representatives of all denominations with
out any restriction are invited to occupy the
pulpit from Sabbath to Saboath at the uni
versity, and 1 note with satisfaction that the
students as a rule attend voluntarily in large
numbers, and listen with rare attentiveness to
the sermons preached. I also note with gratl
ficatlou that there pervades among them a
deep and sincere religious sentiment, as is
shown by the regular Sunday evening meet
ings attended chiefly by the young men and
women of the university. 1 feel assured that
God has a plac<j in their hearts, therefore I
have thought that as soon as my financial con
dition warranted it 1 would like to establish a
professorship of Bible history, to be filled by
one who will letch it without any prejudice.
in the next place I would impress on you
the importance of a subject near my heart
that of economy being taught the students. A
student will be better fitted to battle with the
trials and tribulations of life if he (or she) has
been taught the worth of money, the necessity
ol saving und of overcoming a d-sire to Imi
tate those who ore better off in the wor.d's
goods. For, when he has learned how to save
and how io control inordinate desires he will
be relatively rich. During the post three and
a half years of close observation on my purl
the importance of economy has impressed it
self forcibly upon me, and I wisn it to be
taught to all students of - the university.
Nature has made the surroundings of the uni
versity beautiful, and the substantial clmrac
ter of the buildings gives them an appearance
of luxury to impress upon the students the
necessity of their preservation for the genera
tions that are to follow. The lesson thus
t;iught will remain with them through ltf >
and help them to teach the lesson to others.
The university buildings and grounds are lor
their use while students, in trust lor students
to come. MjBiIH 1 1 1 Mill W^tVi iflinmc
Another subject I have given serious con
sideration to is that we should not be ambi
tious in increase the present number of stu
dents, 1100, for some years. If our
Heavenly Father spares me to become the
actunl possessor of the property it was intended
should be mine, it would afford me great satis
faction to add some necessary buildingsâ the
chapel, library building, chemical building
and two additions to the museumâ the latter
in order to have a place for the works of art
and curios I direct to have removed there
from my home in tnis City, my home at Palo
Alto and my home la Washington, D. C, after
my departure from earthly life. Even with
the addition of the?e buildings, the present
number of students would only be made com
fortable, but they could then use all the rooms
in the quadrangle, which are now over
crowded, as recitation-rooms. These build
ings are needed, and I hope the trustees will
be able in the future to build them, if I am not
during my lifetime.
The next subject to which l would call your
specixl interest in the luture is the mechanical
departments. I know lull, well how impor
tant my husband considered > these debsrt
ments. The large workshops were fitted up at
an enormous expense with the very finest and
best of machinery and tools. During the first
two years there were over 100 students busily
engaged in learning how to use their hands
dettly ;and usefully in the machine-shops.
This number, from some cause which we can
not understand, has been. steadily decreasing
from year to year.
It was a theory of my husband that the labor
of a man whose brain has been developed in
conjunction with skilled hands made him so
superior to the ordinary workman as to enable
him to command the highest compensation.
He also felt that the presence of these depart
ments in the university tended to greatly
dignify labor.
Many of the students come to this univer
sity because the advantages are free and be
cause they know that they will be obliged to
carve out their own future, and with the en
couragement which we will give these depart
ments in the future they may gladly pursue
this course of study. The professional world
has more than its quota, while the manual has
still room for more skilled workmen. If these
departments are encouraged and work in the
machine-shops and wood-working departments
are made major subjects their graduating
classes would be larger and would readily find
responsible positions. When you put on the
armor and take up the work where I leave it I
charge you to pay special attention to these
departments. Let the laborer always keep be
fore him these words of our precious Savior:
"My Father worked hitherto, and I work."
in the act of the Legislature under which
the Leland Stanford Jr. University was
iounded and is now in existence is the follow
ing clause: '-The person making the grant
may therein designate such rules and regula
tions ior the management ol the property con
veyed as the grantor may elect to prescribe;
but such rules shall, unless the grantor other
wise prescribe, be deemed advisory only and
shall not preclude such trustees from making
such changes as new conditions may from
time to time require." And In the same act
of the Legislature occurs the following clause:
"And In all cases the powers and duties con
ferred and Imposed by such grant upon the
trustee or trustees therein named shall be ex
ercised and performed by the person making
such grant, or by his wife durin. his or her
life as the case maybe; provided, however,
that upon the death 61 such person or his sur
viving wife, as the case may be, such powers
and duties shall devolve upon ai.d shall be ex
ercised by the trustees named in the grant
and their successors."
Now, thereiore, under the terms of these
clauses and in the exercise of the powers that
the act of the Legislature give me, I, as re
maining grantor of the Leland Stanford Jr.
University, do hereby elect and direct that in
future when a vacancy or vacancies shall oc
cur in the beard of trustees of said university,
either by death, resignation, removal or in
ability to serve, or by any other cause, said
vacancy or vacancies shall not be filled until
the number of the members of the board of
trustees be reduced by death, resignation, re
moval, inability to serve, or 'for any other
cause, to the number of fifteen, after which
as a vacancy may occur it shall be rilled In the
manner designated in the grant of endowment,
but the number of trustees shall thereafter
never exceed fifteen. In the'board of trustees
nine persons shall constltnte a quorum, but
the assent of not less than a majority of the
wholeâ to wit, eight shall be necessary for
affirmative action in the execution of the
trusts herein contained.
And further, in accordance with the pro
visions of the aforesaid act of the Legislature,
I do hereby elect to direct that from this time
forth when a member of the board of trustees
shall be appointed he shall be appointed for
the term of ten year*, Instead of as heretofore
for life. But this shall not apply to the mem
bers of the present board of trustees.
In explanation of these two changes in the
board of trustees I will state in resard to the
first that during the last few years of my hus
band's lifetime he frequently discussed with
me the advantages of a smaller board than the
one of twenty-four members and the advisa
bility of the number some day being reduced.
As regards the appointment of members for
a limited term of years Instead of for life, I
have considered the matter from many stand
points, carefully and prayerfully, and have
nad the advantage of the experience of other
institutions governed by boards of trustees,
with the result that I deem it important and
beneficial to make the change. This change,
however, does not apply to any members of
the present board.
In making alterations in the original grant
of endowment I feel a solemn conviction that
1 am doing what my husband, were be still
with us, would have done.
Before closing, let me further direct that, in
course of time, the board of trustees shall
elect and number among its members many of
the alumni of the university.
â¢'Dear Father in heaven, I wish thy will to
be done and not mine; unless my will be thy
will, 1 ask for thine instead of mine."
With this she handed over the convey
ance of the property, which set forth the
facts that Jane L. Stanford, surviving
widow of the late Leland Stanford, who
aeparled this life on June 21, 1893, is the
party of the first part; and that Francis
E. Spencer of San Jose, Charles Goodall,
Charles F. Crocker, Timothy Hopkins,
Henry L. Dodge, Irving M. Scott, H. W.
Harkness, Horace Davis and George E.
Gray of San Francisco. John Boggs of

W. Spaulding of Oakland, William M.
Stewart of the State of Nevada, Charles G.
Lathrop, Edward R. Taylor, Joseph D.
Grant and Leon Sloss of San Francisco,
Josiah W. Stanford of Alameda, S. F. Lieb
of San Jose, Frank Miller of Sacramento,
Horatio Slebbins of San Francisco,
Thomas Welton Stanford of Melbourne,
Australia, and Russell J. Wilson of San
Francisco, as trustees under the grant
founding and endowing the Leland Stan
ford Jr. University, bearing the date of
November 11, 1885, and duly executed
and acknowledged by Leland Stanford
an I Jane L. Stanford, are the parties of
tne second part. In legal language the
document states that Mrs. Staniord grants
and conveys in trust to the trustees and
to their successors the following described
parcel of land, with its buildings and con
tents:
Commencing at the corner formed by the
intersection of the southerly line of California
street with the westerly line' of Powell;
thence running westerly along the southerly
line of California street, 206 feet and 3 inches ;
thence at a right angle southerly and parallel
with the westerly line of Powell street 275 feet
to the westerly line of Pine street; thence
at a right angle easterly and along the north
erly line of Pine street 206 feet and 3 inches
to the westerly line of Powell, 275 feet to the
southerly line of California and the point of
commencement, and being portion of block
164 of the 50-vara lot survey of the City and
County of San Francisco. ,' Â ;
Together with all and singular the tene

thereunto belonging, or in any wise apper
taining, etc., and situate thereon, to have and
to hold with the appurtenances unto the said
parties of the second part as trustees, and to
their successors and assigns forever, under tne
grant founding and endowing the Leland
Stanford Jr. University. Subject, however, to
the light of the pArty of the first part to keep,
use, have and enjoy the same and the whole
thereof for and during the term of her natural
life; and thereafter the same shall be ded.
cated and set aside as an affiliated college of
the Leland Stanford Jr. University, or as a
library for the use of the students of the said
university and the people of the City and
County of San Francisco, or for some benevo
lent purpose, for the instruction of the said
students -and the people in such a mode and
manner and with such limitations as to the
said parties of the second part and their suc
cessors may seem best; and the same shall
never be appropriated for the use of a club
house, a boarding-house or a place of undig
nified amusement.
To this was signed the name of Mrs.
Stanford, with the names of Russell J.
Wilson, Bertha Berner and James Mason,
the notary, as witnesses. While deliver
ing her address and while listening to the
reading ot the document Mrs. Stanford
was visibly affected. The trustees ac
cepted their new responsibility and
assured the donor that her wishes will be
observed in letter and spirit. She thanked
them tor the assurance and for their help
to her in carrying out the desires of her
husband.
To a. Call reporter a little later Mrs.
Stanford said: "I do not claim all the
credit for what i have done to-day. Years
ago my husband and I discussed this
matter, and we decided that this would be
the best use. to which we could put this
property. I am doing no more than he
would have done had I been the first to
pass over to the other - life. We cannot

pose of what we have here so that it will
do the greatest good to the largest num
ber when we are gone. I would have done
this before no doubt but for the trouble I
have been to in relation to the big Govern
ment suits that have involved the estate.
"While I remain on this side of life, for
Ido not consider that here is any such
thing as death it is only a change â I will
regard this bouse as my home. All of the
tender ties of husband and son, whom I
will join before many years pass, are cen
tered In this home, and when I pass out 1
want this home to become a part of tbe
educational system that my husband es
tablished, and which he was so deeply in
terested in. When I pass over I do not
want these things in which my husband,
ray son and I took so much pleasure
scattered, and by the means adopted they
will all be kept together and be of use and
benefit to many others."
One thought is suggested in the dispo
sition of the Staniord mansion in this
way. Adjoining is the Hopkins Institute
of Art, which by similar arrangement on
the part of the donors has passed to tbe
University of California and for similar
purposes. In the future these rival uni
versities will be rivals indeed, for each
will have a City annex of grand appear
ance. In each will be congregated at times
the best and brightest minds that the
world will produce, ana each institution,
with but an ornamental stone fence divid
ing, will endeavor to harbor genius and
talent that will outrace and outshine the
other. ' ; fi-

Many mothers have been brought through
the trying time almost painlessly by the aid
of Dr. Pierre's Favorite Prescription. It
prepares the system for delivery by im-
parting the organic strength and elasticity
which the mother specially needs ; shortens
the time of labor and of confinement ; pro-
motes the secretion of abundant nourish-

constitution against the after period of de-
pression and weakness. It's use should '
begin in the early months of gestationâ the
earlier the better.
Mrs. Fred Hunt, of Glenville. Schenectady Co.,

Prescription being so good for a woman with
child, so I got two bottles last September, and
December 13th, I had a twelve-pound baby girl.
When I was confined I was not sick in any way.
I did not suffer any pain, and when the child-
was born 1 walked into another room and went ,
to bed. I never had an after-pain or any other
Pain- This is the eighth child and the largest
of them all. I suffered everything that flesh
could suffer with the other babies. I always had
a doctor and then he could not help me very
much, but this time my mother and my husband
were alone with me. My baby was only seven
days old when I got up and dressed and left my
room and stayed up all day." . v . -
