Washington, D. C, Jan. 13, 1897.
Hon. W. T. Jeter, Lieutenant-Governor ana
President of the Joint Legislative Assembly: Per
mit me through you to express to the joint
legislative assembly my most sincere appre
ciation of the honor conferred upon me by my
re-election as one of California's Senators in
Congress. This evidence of your confidence is
intensified by the fact that your choice was
made only eight days after the organization of
the Legislature and on the first day that by
law you were permitted to vote on this ques
tion. The honor conferred is made more dis
tinguished from the further fact that it has
been bestowed upon me while separated by
3009 miles and removed from all possibility
of exerting personal influence upon j your ac
tion. , .â "**_-,-..-â  -â â  . â¢-â¢- v
All 'thin meres*-** within me the feeling of
responsibility which the high office brings
and strengthens my ambition to work If possi
ble wltn more zeal for the Interests of the
people who have so often honored me with
their confidence.
I shall endeavor to act in the future as in
the past, as far as in my power lies, in accord
ance with the principles enumerated by the
Republican National platforms, and shall
ever bear in mind the truth that he who best
serves his State best serves his political party.
George C. Perkins.
No applause was evoked by tbe official
declaration of Mr. Perkins' election, or by
bis message acknowledging the honor
conferred. The joint convention ad

GENERAL LEGISLATION.
Many Bills Introduced to Amend
Present Laws and Protect
Working-men.
SACRAMENTO, Cal, Jan. 13.â
Alt' ouph the Senate was tardy in getting
to the consideration of bills, the lost time
was more than made up on Monday, when
169 bills were put in. On Tuesday, owin
to the interposition of the Senatorial elec
tion, but twenty-nine bills were intro
duced and to-day seventy-four, making a
grand total for the Senate alone of 272.
Among the bills introduced by Senator
Bert was one authorizing the appointment
of an interpreter of the Japanese language
in criminal proceedings in cities of 100,000
or more inhabitants." The bill carries with
it the significant fact of the increase of
the Japanese population of San Francisco.
The same gentleman has also introduced

of governing commitees or governing

to-morrow. The bill to reduce the rates

upon the bill concerning the filing of me
chanics' liens by adding a proviso that the
owner of real property must give notice of
the completion of improvements thereon.
Senator Dickinson is looking out for tbe
interest of dairymen in his district, and
lias introduced a bill defining the different
grades of cheese, and for branding the
same manufactured in California; also
another bill to prevent deception' in tbe
manufacture and --ale of butter and cheese.

south of Market street.
Senator Hall comes to tbe rescue of men
employed in bakeries, and has a bill be
fore the Committee; on Labor and Capital
to regulate the hours of labor of men em
ployed in bakeries. It is likely that the
question of constitutionality will be raised
with respect to this humane* bill. The
same committee will handle the bill to
enforce prompt payment of the wages of
laborers in lawiul money of the United
States. This bill strikes at firms which
make their employes wait a month or
more for their wages, as is done by the
railroad company in its Sacramento shops.'
Ii also aims to do away with tne system of
paying the men in sawmill and other dis
tricts in orders or checks which the men
are forced to shave.

ing for a bond for the protection of labor
ers on public work.

apprehension of murderers and other
felons. ||pÃfp
Senator La Rue will attempt to make a
law prohibiting the adulteration of wine
and to prevent the manufacture anÂ«! sale
of such adulterated product. The title of
the bill, which is "An act to amend an act
entitled 'an act to prohibit the sophistica
tion and adulteration of wine and to pre
vent the manufacture and sale thereof,' "
is ambiguous, for it reads that the, manu
facture and '; sale of ' wine ' should bo pre
vented. _ , , ' ,*-'._ - v ..'-\ "*â¢ v
There are several bills before both houses
empowering municipalities to acquire and
condemn water, and ito. sell' the same to
their inhabitants. ."Senator Luchsinger is
the . author of one of these. There is a
strong feeling among the members of the
Legislature in favor of municipal owner
ship of light and water, the Populists
being for; it, of * course, and IRe publican s"
arid Democrats alike .having a favorable
opinion of it. It -is not and ; cannot be a
party measure by any means.- w J;â  -V

; There are several bills in both bouses
proposing â¢ new-' methods of holding
r.dmary. elections, most of them providing
that' primaries be held on the same day

' -The laws of ; general interest apart Irom
local influence may be summarized into
very few, and the summary will indicate
the pervading sentiment of" the member
ship of ? the present session; These laws
provide j for ,a reduction of the \ hours of
labor among bakers and other toilers, for
whom there is allowed but little rest,"
Labor will be protected in the collec
tion of its earnings in money and
promptly. Employment offices and pawn
brokers (the two seem to go together
somehow or other) will be ..placed under
stricter regulations for the protection of
the poor from the labor-sweater and the
three-ball shark.', Reforms will bo insti
tuted in the method of primary elections.
Some commissions will be abolished and
the appropriations for others will be cut
down, for this is a Legislature of economy,
it is said; but there are many persons here
who do not believe it. Particular attention
will be paid to the prevention of the sale
of adulterated milk, cheese and butter,
and the dairymen's 1 interests generally
will be looked after.
. Supervisor King of San Francisco came
up to-day to look after a bill authorizing
himself and bis associates to condemn and

site of the old City Hall in San Francisco,
so that the new â¢ building may have the
benefit of the entire half block. .',
| S nator Braunhart will be after the
shorthand "reporters in . the Police courts
with 1 a sharp stick. . He says that they
earn too much money. For instance, the
following sums ; were -.paid s to the stenog
raphers.of the four Police Courts for one
year's according to ; the last munici
pal report: Police*. Court 1, $6519 45; No.
2, $6213 70; No. 3, $4020; No. 4, $4622: 85. ,-..
"I propose to reform, the Police Court,"
said the Senator to the : writer to-day, "by
providing for three Judges to be appointed
by the Mayor* after the expiration of tbe
terms of office of the incumbents, and to
change the law so that the Police Court
clerks shall be appointed by the County
Clerk and be under his management and
control ;' also that the prosecuting attor
neys of the Police courts shall be appoint
ed by c District Attorney. At least one
ofthe courts must be i*a session eacb day
until 5 'p., M. ; The Superior courts" con
tinue in session until that hour, arid there
is no reason why Police Court officials
; should go out to" the races in the after
noons when Superior Judges must remain
in their courts and do business. Police
Court stenographers should receive a fixed
salary of â¢> $200 â  â¢ per month. The stenog
rapher in the Coroner's office transcribes
the testimony at all inquests for $150 per
month, and ho does more v work than all
the Police- Court reporters put together. "
The Senator's declaration of intention
will be likely to cause much commotion
in the ranks of the shorthand fraternity
in San Francisco. - ,;- t r" ,^

j Assemblyman Treacy of San . Francisco
-has' put in a bill that, will cause no end of
Wllsi'J^tvonly in t the - Legislature ; but
throughout the State. * It provides that
the minimum wages for â , labor on public
work, ( whether the work be done' directly
by j the State -or the municipalities |or let
out by them on contract, shall be $2 per
day. Treacy argues ? that should the bill
become a law contractors will put in their
bids on public work on the basis of ; $2 per
day for common laborers and that no one
will be injured thereby. The money will
be expended in the community, as labor
ers' and mechanics' wages always with
the result that trad? will be livelier and
the money will be put at once into general
circulation. '.'
; Treacy says that laborers on certain pub
lic work in San Francisco are -paid by the
contractors 90 cents per day or $5 40 per
week and out of this miserable pittance
earned by the sweat of his brow the poor
slave of the sewer must pay for his board
and lodging, and iif he be married must
support his family. ' *. ",
I A five-dollar-and-forty-cent family is a
terrible thing to. contemplate in these
days of civilization in California. It is
more terrible than pitiable when one looks
into the future .and, speculates upon the
destiny.of the children belonging xto .' that
family. There will be an opportunity for
many eloquent arguments*. when the bill
shall come up for passage and the speeches
will.no: doubt be eloquent, even though
they may be homsly, rugged and uncouth.'
Why? Because the voice of charity,
voice that, speaks!; on * behalf lof > down
trodden humanity, will sound in'tbe ears
of the hopeless gutter slave. as sweetly
and as blessedly as an angel's song. ,; â ;.'

Collis P. Huntington, However, Has
Net-Yet Gtvn Up All Hope of
Relief From Congress.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 13.â 1t can
be definitely stated that the stockholders
of the Union Pacific Railroad have finally
abandoned all further hope of obtaining
friendly legislation at the bands of Con
gress.
They are reported to have made over
tures to President Cleveland looking to a
settlement of the road's indebtedness to
the Government. What the details of the
proposition of the stockholders are cannot
be stated, since the proposition is still
largely tentative in its nature. It is un
derstood, however, tbat it involves cash
payments, either of a lump sum in settle
ment of the indebtedness or payment in
installments, the first payment to be a
major fraction of the entire debt, the rest
to be paid within five years, the unpaid
portions to bear interest at a rate of be
tween 3 and 3>j per cent.
The : proposition is understood to be de
cidedly more advantageous to the Gov
ernment than was the Powers funding
bill, which the House slaughtered on
Monday.
. r Mr. Huntington, however, representing
Central Pacific, will not . co-operate
with the Union Pacific. He still believes
that something can be obtained from Con
gress, and he will make no proposition
until every effort at legislative relief has
been abandoned.
This information comes from Senator
Brice of Ohio, a stockholder of the Union
Pacific, and it was imparted to a brother
Senator to-day.
Huntington left Washington last night
and is now in New York City. It can be
stated upon excellent authority that he
will make the most strenuous efforts to
sneure the passage of some kind of a bill
at this session of Congress to prevent fore
closure on the Central Pacific.
The Central and Union Pacific people
were very much alarmed to-day on ac
count of a conference held between Presi
dent Cleveland and Attorney-General
Harmon. The latter was instructed to
file his foreclosure suits immediately.
This report induced the Union Pacific
people . to make their tentative offer of
settlement. Mr. Huntington will, how
ever, fight to the last ditch. He has de
spaired of the hope of passing a refunding
bill, and is said to favor the bill intro
duced by Senator Gtar to-day, providing
for a commission to settle the indebted
ness of the roads.
I'OWEKS IV JA IS A. SEW BILL,
Chairman Powers wants to see some
*tftPi*s > done, and he does not feel like
â¢*>â -*- it^**t> ascertain the attitude of the
President. He thinks a new bill could be
prepared which would suit the House.
The California members of the House do
not think there will be any further action
on the question.
*: "While I will not commit myself to it,"
said Chairman Powers to-night, "I have
thought that there were some good points
in the . proposition for a commission to
settle this question. The idea was pro
posed heretofore, but the majority of the
committee thought the Government would
be better protected under the bill which2
was defeated. Tha House is too large a
body to handle a question of this kind.
A commission of not over five members,
to be appointed by the President and con
firmed by the Senate, might settle the
whole thing sooner than it looKs as though
it would be settled."
Mr. Powers expressed the belief that the
bill was defeated because many members
of the House were afraid their constitu
ents would hold them responsible if they
voted for the bill.
Doubt is expressed whether a new bill
can be prepared and pushed through Con
gress at this session, but a number of
members of the House committee think
that one -could be put through if it met
tbe wishes of the House. Mr. Hubbard,
who led the opposition to the bill which
was defeated, thinks that a bill might be
put through at this session ii it was for
the appointment of a commission. That
is his idea of a settlement of the matter,
and he so stated to-day.
"The appointment of a commission hav
ing full power to act is the logical way
out of this matter," said Hubbard. Hub
bard is the man who defeated Bland two
years ago, and who was defeated by Bland
last fall. *\XaWk
"That commission," he continued,
must be made in such a way to be accept
able to Congress. I have no fixed idea yet
as to bow. it should be arranged or what
its powers should be, except that it should
be composed of men from the different
sections of the country, who Will be fair
and just to the Government and to the
railroads. The commission should have
power to summon witnesses and to. hear
all the testimony."
Mr. Hubbard said he had no idea
whether a commission would be accept
able to the President. He said it is at the
option of President Cleveland whether he
begins foreclosure proceedings now or
not. The present law, he said, is opera
tive until it is repealed, and has been so
decided by the Supreme Court. Under
that law the Government can retain 30
per cent of the net earnings ol the road.
It can retain all the transportation and
mail charges.
"That," said Mr. Hubbard, "is $80,000
a year more than the Government could
have got under the present bill."
Representative . Harrison, whose substi
tute providing for a commission was de
feated, expects a meeting of the Pacific
Railroads Committee to be called at an
early date. He looks for further action.
Some of those who voted for the Harri
son substitute say that it would have been
stronger had it stood on its own merits,
but the opponents of the funding bill
were determined to defeat it, and to do so
they defeated every substitute and every
proposition offered.
There is a strong element which asserts
that no new bill can be got through this
session. This element is composed of the
men who want to force the Government to
begin foreclosure. Tbey do not want any
thing else, because they think the Govern
ment can get all that is coming to it by
tbis method.
While the House committee is consider
ing what it will do, the Senate committee
may also be debating the question. It
knows now that there is no use to push
the bill defeated by the House, and it will
possibly report another bill. It is not im
possible that Chairman Powers and the
members of the committee may confer
with the Senate committee and determine
what will be best to do. If this is done the
two committees can report similar bills,
as they did on tbe bill just defeated.
There is but little doubt that Mr. Hunt
ington has intimated to Senator Gear and
Representative Powers, chairmen respec
tively of the Senate and House commit
tees, that the bill for a commission would
be acceptable to the Central Pacific. He
bopes to be able to control its members,
and for the same reason he consented that
a commission be appointed to settle the
location of a deep harbor on the Southern
California coast.

Union Minority in the Legislature on the
'trail of Huntin-jton.
' SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan. 13.â The
union minority caucus called by the
chairman, Assemblyman Sanford to meet
it 9 o'clock to-morrow morning, will en
deavor to prescribe a line of action for the
Democrats and Populists in the Legisla
ture.
To-night it is reported that the minority
members will insist that the Legislature
shall ask Congress to take opportune steps
in dealing with delinquent Pacific roads.
, Morgan's bill pending in Congress pro
rides the way lor the Secretary of the
Treasury to proceed to foreclosure. It i
surmised that Huntington, who raised
the money to pay interest this year, may
dig up ten million dollars to pay the
amount falling due in 1898. The Union
Pacific has already defaulted. Some of
the Populists are outspoken for Govern
ment ownership and the question is lively
to cause hot discussion in the minority
caucus. fSJBSB

FOR A TBHtiVGH LIME.
The Vanderbitti and Morgan After the
Union and <* "ntrnl J'ae'fle.
NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. 13.â The Her
ald says: Reports were in circulation last
night that the Union Pacific reorganiza
tion commission, having now within its
control nearly all of the bonds and stock
of the company by means of the agree
ment under which they wera deposited,
is ready to bid a fair sum forthe road 1 from
Omaha to Osden.
The programme is said to be to take up
the Government bonds on both the Union
and Central Pacific roads so as to give
them a through line to the coast. -
* According to the report the support of
the Vanderbilts and J. Pierpont Morgan is
expected to be obtained. In fact, if it is
carried out they may head the syndicate
that furnishes the necessary capital, for
thereby the Vanderbilt roads would --ecure
a through line from Omaha to San Fran
cisco. This would give a continuous sys
tem from Boston and New York to the
Pacific Coast, and it would constitute the
strongest system in the country.
No confirmation was obtainable last
night, but, in the opinion of railroad
men, the presence of two recognized Van
derbilt men on the Union Pacific re
organization committee is very signifi
cant.
According to Washington dispatches
similar'reports were in circulation there
last night about the plans of the Union
Pacific reorganization committee and
the supposed intentions of Mr. Morgan
and the Vanaerbilts.
Washington advices state that while it
is the intention of the President to make
a vigorous effort to secure some sort of a
settlement with these roads before March
4, Attorney-General Harmon is not ready
to institute foreclosure proceedings. Many
facts remain to be gathered before the de
partment can be assured of its ground,
such as information concerning the titles
to branch lines, terminals and more par
ticularly as to the prospect of there being
a satisfactory bid for the roads in case the
courts order auction sales.

Chief Clerk Duckworth Admits,
However. That the Limit Has
Been Passed. .
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 13âRepub
lican Assemblymen caucused to-day lor the
purpose of considering a rumor that more
clerks had been placed on the temporary
roll of organization than the service re
quired. Chief Clerk S. J. Duckworth
made a statement to the caucus that he
had yielded to the importunities of mem
bers in making up the roll and if any
wrong had been done be was responsible.
He said that warrants would not be deliv
ered to attaches who were not here. The
amount involved does not exceed $200.
The caucus appointed a committee, of
which Assembly Anderson of Solano is
chairman, to investigate the matter and
withdraw warrants issued in favor of at
taches who did not attend. BffrgSÃffi
Chief Clerk Duckworth was interviewed
to-day. He said there was absolutely no
truth in the report that the roll had been
stuffed. _ â Â.â :
Railroad Commissioner La Rue is here

BILLS FROM ASSESSORS.

the committee on banks and legislation,
appointed by the Assessors" State Conven
tion met to-night with Judjje Daly of the
Code Commission. The Assessors com
posing the committee on , banks and
legislation are J. F. Campbell,' Stanis
laus; C. L. Ortnian, San Joaquin; Theo
dore SummerJand, Los Angeles; M. V.
Vanderhoof, Sonoma; J. O. Vincent,
Fresno., The session was held with closed
doors, but it transpires that the bill pre
prred under the direction of the Assessors
will be ready for presentation to the Legis
lature next Friday.';'..,'';'.; _:._â ', â -.'.,;.:..
--: The Assessors Kept their counsels reason
ably secr.-t, hot carinjj to invite the hos
tility of banks and corporations, but they
are confident that the bills which '-. they!
[ have, prepared will, if enacted with laws, ,
add $400,000,000 to the assessment roll of
the State.
The discussion to-night developed the
i sentiment that corporation property should
be reached for taxation even if an open
fight in support of the. prepared measure
should be the result. Some of the con
servative members of the conference
deemed it advisable to insert certain pro
visions which the banks would surely
fight, but other members argued that the
laws as they now stand enabled Assessors
to reach all taxable property in the State
other than that of banks and certain cor
porations.
The Assessors are acting in harmony
with the Code Commissioners. It is al
most certain that- the Assessors' bills,
when Introduced, will precipitate one of
the hottest contests ever brought to the
Legislature. At a late hour to-night the
main points under discussion were agreed
upon.
WILL NOT BE REPEALED.
j The Sentiment of the Legislature
Favors the Wright Irrigation
Law.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Jan. 13.â 1t can
be foreshadowed now that the Wright ir
rigation act will not be repealed by the
present Legislature. The Assembly Com
mittee on Irrigation met to-night. As
semblymen Lindenberger (chairman),
Judge Waymire, Mr. Boone of Tulare and
other members exchanged notes regarding
the sentiment in each house. In the Sen
ate Simpson was classed as the only Sen
ator outspoken for repeal. In the Assem
bly the opinion is almost unanimous in
favor of preserving the law.
Some amendments were found neces
sary by the committee. It was proposed
in a general way to amend the law so that
outstanding irrigation bonds may be re
funded by the issue of new bonds bearing
5 or 6 per cent interest and running for
! twenty years. Judge Waymire believes
that 6 per cent bonds refunded will be 1
taken at par. ' Interesting district experi
ences were related. One member gave the
calamities in this order: First, the
drought; second, crop failure; third, the
Cleveland administration, and fourth, the
Judge Ross decision. It was stated that
more failures had occurred outride of irri
gation districts than within district limits.
Budd Suns the First Bill.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 13.âGover
nor Budd signed the fir bill of the ses
sion to-night. It was Assembly bill 152,

HOSPITAL FOR CONSUMPTIVES.
Startling Report nf Sew York Health
Officials.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 13.â Dr. Her
man . Biggs, pathologist and director *of
the laboratory of the Board of Health, Dr.
T. M. Prudden of the Bellevue Medical
College and Health Commissioner George
B. Fowler, a committee appointed to re
port on the care and treatment of cases of
One Way to Prevent a Chair From "Walking Away.
tuberculosis, have made a report and
recommendation to the Health Board,
suggesting that a hospital be erected for
the exclusive treatment of consumptives.
The report says that there are 20,000 cases
of consumption in the city and thai at
least fifty persons daily contract the dis
ease from coming iv contact with those
already infected.
Consumption, the committee declares,
is a contagious and deadly disease and
should be treated as such. The records of
the health department show , that there
were 6000 deaths from tuberculosis during
the past year.
"A great portion of this suffering and
death," the report -ays, "in view of mod
trn scientific knowledge, we Know to be
largely preventable by the efficient en
forcement of simple well-understood and
easily applied methods of cleanliness, dis
infection and isolation." .
The Board of Health adopted the report
and decided to take the necessary steps
toward the erection of the hospital pro
posed. Nothing can be done in that di
rection immediately, as the board has
already made its appropriations for the
year. At its next regular meeting the
board will adopt an amendment to the
sanitary code and the Legislature will be
asked to aid the desired reform. .
OHIO WOOL-GROWERS MEET.
The Buckeye State' Will Be Lost Four
Years Hence Unless Something Is
Done lor the Farmer. .
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 13.â For the
first time the" Ohio Wool-growers' Asso
ciation, . in Â»its meeting to-day, was not
unanimous regarding tariff protection.
The resolutions reported from the com
mittee set forth that the removal of the
tariff on wool had ruined the sheep-rais
ing business and demanded the res
toration of protection. They did not in
dorse the -Dingley bill now before the
Ways and Means Committee of the House.
Judge William- Lawrence, president of
the association, moved to amend by in
serting an indorsement of tbe Dingley bill.
It was developed in the discussion that
followed tbat the committee thought the
bill too radical, and would not report the
resolutions with the indorsement in them.
The amendment offered by Judge Law
rence was finally adopted on a weak vote.
In the course of his remarks Judge Law
rence said if t c incoming administration
did not do something for the farmer Ohio
would go for free silver four years hence.
The preamble declares that the severest
blow ever dealt the agricultural in
terest of the United States was inflicted by
tbe tariff of 1894, and the most disastrous
of all was the placing of wool on the tree
list, this action depreciating the American
flocks one-third, reducing the price of
wool 50 per cent and causing a loss to the
wool -growers in three years of over
$175,000,000; that it is fast eliminating the
most important branch of industry irom
the farmer and farm laborers as well as
others who must draw their support from
agricultural industries; that it is the first
and highest duty of the incoming admin
istration to revise the tariff at the earliest
possible moment. The resolutions de
mand that such duty as will fully restore
the industry be put upon wool, and the
new tariff act should contain a clause pro
viding for additional duties on wool and
woolens in bonded warehouses or imported
after March 5, 1897," and declaring against
ad valorem duties as inviting frauds.
PRESS REFORMERS SPLIT.
The President of the Association Suspends
the Secretary and Makes a Few
Explanations.
OMAHA, Neb., Jan. 13â Paul Van Der
Voort, president of â¢ the National Reform
Press Association, was seen this evening
and shown the ; ; dispatch which was sent
out from St. Louis to-day relating to the
strained relations which exist between
the officers of the association. He noted
the fact that Secretary Roselle bad called
a convention at Kansas City in opposition
to the regular one at Memphis, Term..
February 22, and then dictated this reply :
â  Referring to the dispatch from St. Louis in
the evening papers, I have the lowing state
ment to make: The executive committee, with
one dissenting voice, voted to hold the annual
meting at MemDhis. Mr. Roselle also took a
vote, with the same result. ; We also polled the
officers of the association, and all but Mr.
Roselle voted for Memphis. He protested, and
wanted, to hold the meeting at St. Louis or
Kansas City.
I Full arrangements have been made at Mem
phis, and at all cities the authorities are co
operating. Mr. Roselle went in with the
Democratic party in Missouri and is seeking
an office at tne hands of the Democratic Gov
ernor. He is seeking to disrupt the parly and
turn it over to the Democrats. In accordance
with our constitution I have taken a vote of
the executive' committee and its members
have decided to suspend Mr. Roselle from his
position and membership, which I hereby an
nounce. He can hold any sideshow ne pleases.
The great majority of our members have
hoisted the bIaCK flag against fusion. During
the campaign we were ail willing to support
Mr. Bryan if the agreement to withdraw
Sewall was kept, It naving been broken by
the Democratic party we were under no obli
gations to support a man who did not repre
sent one single principle of our party except
silver and was only a recent convert to thai. .
Under our rules any Populist paper which
Lotted Watson is noi eligible to membership.
Mr. Kdminstou of Lincoln, Nebr., â¢ has been
sending out a circular denouncing me. and as
he asked replies I judge that he has found out
that the majority of tne members support my
position, and now they propose to organize a
new association.
i We deplore any snlit, but it will not occur,
among our regular members. I hereby issue a
call for a general conference of the People's
party at Memphis on the lines laid down in
Oeorge F. Wasnburn's circular. â¢

SUGAR AND COFFEE DEAL.
The Arbuckles Gst Their Fingers Burned
and Now Seek Redress Through
the Courts. .
TOLEDO, Ohio, Jan. 13.â At noon to
day Kumler & Smith, attorneys for
Thomas J. Kuhn of Cleveland and Ar
buckle Brothers of New York, a minority
of the stockholders, filed a petition asking
for a receiver*Â»for the Woolson Spice Com
pany. Judge Morris caused a temporary
restraining order to issue and will hear the
motion January 25. : ;'â¢;];
The petition names the Woolson Spice
Com* any and the American Sugar Refin
ing Company as defendants, and states
that the stock of the Woolson Soice Com
pany i* valued at $300,000. Kuhn and the
Arbuckle Brothers own one share jointly
and the latter own sixty shares individu
ally. It is alleged that the American
Sugar Refining Company controls the
price of shares in the United States; that
the Arbuckies have been in competition
with the Woolson Company in the coffee
business; that they sold sugar bought in
the so-called trust.
It is further stated that last year the
Arbuckles started a sugar refinery in
Brooklyn ; that thereupon the trust went
into the coffee business, purchased all but
sixty-one shares of the Woolsou Spice
Company and announced that it would
operate the Woolson plant in the sole in
terest of the American Sugar Refining
Company. .â .â â'.
It is alleged that the trust gave out
that the deal was made to crush the Ar
buckles, and that when that was accom
plished the Woolson stock would go back
to the original holders; that the Woolson
directors have resigned* leaving no board
to appeal to; that in the face of the rising
market roasted coffee has been reduced 2
cents a pound and the p. ant is losing $1000
a day. ...'.-
The court is asked , for an inquiry into
the loss sustained by the sugar trust's
operation of the property and that the de
fandants make an accounting for all such
losses. Also the court-is asked to appoint
a receiver. ._
Wanted for Bank Robbery,
HARRIBBURG, Pa., Jan. 13.â Governor
Hastings to-day granted a requisition
made by Governor Francis M. Drake of
lowa for the delivery of James Moore,
who is in jail at Allentown and whose
term expires Thursday. The lowa au
thorities claim the man's real name is J.
J. Riley and that he is wanted at Council
Bluffs for bank robbery and the attempted
murder of a Deputy Sheriff. Deputy
Sheriff O'Brien, who was shot by Riley,
visited the Allentown jail last September
and identified Moore a3 the man who shot
him. Moore strongly denies the charge
and positively declares he is not the al
leged Riley. â¢
One of Two Courses.
NEW YORK, N.Y., Jan. 13.â A mem
ber of the Union Pacific reorganization
committee says that President Cleveland
will adopt one oi two coursesâ either call
upon Congress for an appropriation to
payoff the first mortgage bonds ana as
sume Government ownership and man
agement of the road, or to dispose of tbe
Government claim by foreclosure sale.
The latter course will, no doubt, be taken
in the matter, as President Cleveland's
views in opposition to Government con
trol of railroads are welt known.

ney of New York County, who is in Lon
don for the purpose of assisting in the
defense of Edward J. Ivory, alias Edward
Bell, charged with conspiring with Tynan,
Kearney and Hasines.to commit dyna
mite outrages, said to a reporter of the
United Associated Presses to-day that he
was by no means hopeful of securing
Ivory's acquittal The public, he thought,
was unduly prejudiced against Ivory, and
this feeling is now surely militating
against his acquittal by the jury. How
ever, he added, he had studied the records
of the case and was unable to learn in
what way Ivory had been implicated in
breaking any British statute. Ivory, he
said, would plead not guilty.

GOLD STANDARD
Monetary Reformers Ex
press Their Views Quite
Forcibly.
Retirement of the Demand Obli
gations of the Government
Is Recommended.
It Is Decided to Appoint a Commission
to Inquire* Into the Cur
rency Evils.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Jan. 13.â The
National monetary conference which has
been in session here two days, this after
noon adopted a declaration of what legis
lation in its opinion is needed upon the
subject, by a practically unanimous vote.
This declaration includes a demand for
the maintenance of the gold standard and
the letirement of the demand obligations
of the Government. Accompanying- this
was a proposition for the appointment of
a commission to investigate and report by
bill or otherwise upon the evils and reme
dies of the currency system. This was the
unanimous conclusion of the committee
on resolutions, a result that was unexpec
ted by the delegates.
The recommendations of the committee
were finally affirmed by the substantially
unanimous vote of the convention. This
was not secured, however, without much
oi position and an exceedingly animated
debate, with short controversies between
Congressman Fowler of New Jersey and
State Assemblyman Roots of Indiana,
and Congressman Walker of Massachusetts
and John Harsen Rhoades of New York.
The feature of the morning session was
a speech by Congressman Fowler, in which
he outlined the c.iuses of the present
financial situation and the remedies
therefor.
At the afternoon session Charles E.
Adams of Massachusetts offered a resolu
tion of thanks to H. H. Hanna, chairman
of the executive committee, and to his
associates and to the Indianapolis Board
of Trade and the commercial bodies of the
Middle West for making the conference
possible and their labors in its arrange
ments. The resolution was adopted, after*
brief discussion by the author and A. D.
Wilson of Kentucky, by a rising vote. Mr.
Hanna said he disclaimed any particular
credit for the work of the conference.
There were tco many engaged in it for
that.
Mr. Hanna then presented the report of
the committee on resolutions, which he
said could only be read by the gentleman
who drafted the closing words, and he
therefore called upon M. E. Ingalls of
Cincinnati to discharge that duty. The
report, he further said, to the surprise of
that great body of delegatas, was . the
unanimous expression of the committee.
He asked like unanimous support from
the convention and moved the adoption of
the report. The report was as follows:
(â¢entlemen of the Monetary Conference : This
con terence declares that it has become abso
lutely necessary that a. consistent, straightfor
ward and deliberately planned monetary sys
tem shall be inaugurated, for the fundamental
basis of which should be:
Hrstâ That the present gold stand should be
maintained.
Secondâ That steps should be taken to in
sure the ultimate retirement of all classes of
United States notes by a gradual and steady
process, so as io avoid injurious contraction of
the currency or disturbance of the business
interests of the country, and that such retire
ment provisions should be made ior a separa
tion of the revenue and note issue departments
of the treasury.
Thirdâ Tnat a banking system be provided
which should furnish credit facilities to every
portion of the country and an elastic circula
tion, and especially with a view oi securing
such a distribution of the loanable capital of
the country as will tend to equalize the
rates of interest in all parts thereof. For the
purpose of effectively promoting the above ob
jec;s:
Resolved, That fifteen members of this con
ference be appointed by the chairman to act
cs an executive committee, while this conven

convention. The executive committee shall

any number not exceeding forty-five,' and five
members thereof shall at all times constitute

lions voluntary made tor the purpose, and
shall have power to call this convention to

best to said committee to do so, and said com
mittee shall continue in office with power to
fill vacancies, until discharged at a luture
meeting of this convention.

draft of such bill or bills providing for such
legislation.
. Resolved, Tbat all resolutions and communi
cations as to the method* of currency reform
which have been presented to this convention
be referred to such .committee when formed.
The first sentence read by Mr. Ingalls
caused a great cheering, which .interrupted
the reading for some seconds and led Mr.
Ingalls to remark, "Well, that seems to
be all right, anyhow."
Congressman Walker of Massachusetts,
chairman of the House Committee on
Banning and Currency, opposing the
adoption of the report, said that his com
mittee and the Senate Committee on
Finance had determined to present some
plan of currency and banking reform for
consideration at the extra session of Con
gress. But lor the calling of this conven
tion such a plan wouid hive been pre
sented before now. The convention had
met, and what have you done? He an
swered that the recommendations could
not be considered prior to the- assembling
of the Fifty-sixth Congress. "Do you
want to put off relief," he asked, "until
that time, keening the people in suspense
and distress ior that much longer period?"
Before God and under his oath of office
he said he felt it to be bis duty to do what
he could to improve the present system.
But this scheme involved further delaj'
and the absolute tieing of the bands of the
committee of Congress. Not five mem
bers would attend the meetings, and they
might as well shut up and go home.
Legislation, he said, could only be accom
plished by having it urged upon Con
gress by a body of men who would
give Congress norest day or night until it
i.a.i been accomplished.
"But, in my opinion," he said in conclu
sion, "in the infirmity of human nature
you nave damned the reform lor the pres
ent." 4SB|SHSB BP-ISSME&WiStfI
Mr. Walter's sentiments met some
small approval.
Mr. Roots of Indiana, a member of the
Stale Legislature, said he conceived it to
he the duly of men elected in a representa
tive position to find out the sentiments of
his constituents and then try to carry out
those sentiments whether they happened
to be his own or not.
"Ami dangerous," he said, "is the posi
tion of any member of Congress who
charges us with being lobbyists for any
immoral or other object." [Applause.]
Mr. Roots added his views upon the
commission scheme which involved a
committee to act in consultation with the
Congressional committees in the prepara
tion of currency reform.
Congressman Fowler of New Jersey
offered an amendment to constitute a
permanent executive committee of the
convention consisting of one member
from each State to act in conjunction with
the Congressional committee in framing a
bill to carry out the -purposes outlined in
the committee's report.
Re/erring to Mr. Roots' opening state
ment, which Mr. Fowler said had been ut
tered with a rather superior air, that as a
public official he had learned it was the
duty of a representative to express the
sentiments of his constituents, Mr. Fowler
said: WVaW^BS*l
"There is nothing grander in the
history of American politics than the
action and example of Senator Lamar
in 1878, when from every home, hamlet
and town in his State came demands that
he should vote for the tree coinage of sil
ver. But knowing that they were wrong,
and with his conscience and heart between
him and his God, he voted against it.
Then be went home as every true man
would do, laid down his honor at tbe feet
of his people, went to work to educate
them up to the truth and not to descend
to the level of ignorance." [Applause.]
Mr. Roots, rising to a question of per
sonal privilege, said he had nothing to re
tract, but wished to disavow the sneer
which Mr. Fowler imputed to him, and to
say tbat he approved his proposition to
put thematier in the hands of the people.
Mr. Bullitt of Philadelphia opposed the
Fowler amendment because it was im
practicable for the States to select a com
mittee of the caliber of the man who con
ceived and made possible this convention,
of which alone the committee snould
consist. No progress would have ever
been made in the accomplishment of good
lor humanity if men had been driven irom
the track because some man under the
influence of disappointment over failure
of plan or ambition had told them they
had "damned" the movement they were
supporting. [Applause.
Mr. Bullitt warmly indorsed the repo**t
of the committee as avoiding the dangers I
which threatened any other course. He !
trusted the convention would adopt the !
resolutions as reported.
Mr. Camp of Knoxville, Term., support
ed the Fowler amendment, as being much
more likely to prove effective in accom
plishing what was desired than the com
mittee's proposition. In the selection of
the committee Congress should be repre
sented, he said, and that could be secured
under the Fowler amendment.
Representative WalKer explained that
what he said in his former remarks went
to the point, that the proposition of the
committee meant a delay of action until
the Ffty-sixth Congress, which might dif
fer from the present one on economical
subjects, and therefore it damned the
movement for the present. Members of
Congress, he said, were not wholly igno
rant, and all information did not exist
outside of that body.
In answer to questions by several dele
gates Mr. Walker said the vital element
in the problem was time; that if the pro
posed bill was not prepared and ready for
submission to the special session the set
tlement of the whole question must go
over two years, and everybody who has
ever been in Congress knows it. As to his
position in the conference Mr. Walker
said he was in it with as much tight as the
gentleman from Philadelphia (Bullitt), by
me authority of the Worcester Board of
Trade. He made no threats, he said, and
nothing he had said could properly give
rise to criticism.
To John Harsen Rhoades of New York,
particularly, Mr. Walker said he was
pleading for a change in the method
which business men have followed in the
past. Success by this convention, he said,
was a duty.
Mr. - Rhoadesâ ls it true, Mr. Walker,
that at the close of the nineteenth century
we must buy the passage of any bill
through Congress by the offer of a price â
the re-election of the members? [Loud
applause.] ij&BaaJ
Mr.Wa If this is to bea government
of the people for the people and this con
vention cheers the sentiment and spirit of
that inquiry 1 have nothing to say. But if
the member does not act, so as to get a re
election, he does . not represent the people.
[Applause.] .
M. E. Ingalls of Cincinnati supported
the report of the committee. Hesaid:
"It ha-> seemed to me that our work was
in danger ol injury by the discussion that
is going on hero and which has nothing to
do with the case. . If our friend Walker
wishes to five a lecture on the best way to
help Congress I will hire a hall and give
him an evening. I know the sincerity of
the man and 1 think he is mistaken in his
zeal for the cause and has worked himself
to the idea that there is but one way to
accomplish this thing, and as the
committee did not quite agree with him
in his way be is disappointed. ..
"All I want to say to you, gentlemen,
is that the committee of thirty-live on
resolutions which considered every paper
which was presented to this convention
for discussion, in which almost everybody
participated, appointed a committee of
live and that committee spent hours upon
this, report and finally they brought it
back into the committee on resolutions
and it ran ihe gauntlet of twenty-eight
members and came out as a unanimous
report. I hope ihat the 3500 and odd gen
tlemen here will each and every one vote
aye for this resolution."
In rising to move the previous question
on the pending motion, Mr. Hanna said
the discussion was being carried further
than it should go, working up a feeling
that did not exist. The movement cul
minating in the convention, he said, was
not unfriendly to Congress. '*- It was
thought Congressmen might like to
divide the responsibility.- Congress was
asked to appoint a committee if it would
do so; if. not. the convention, through its
executive committee, would do so.
Tne previous question was ordered and
Mr. Fowler, in delerence to what; he had
said, said the resolution was evidently, tt.e
practically unanimous sentiment of the
convention, amid applause and cries of
"Good for Fowler."
The report and resolutions were agreed
to with but two or three negative votes.

Chances of Madden and Mdson for the
Illinois Senatorship.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Jan. 13. â At a
meeting of the Republican members of
the House and Senate held this afternoon
it was decided to call the caucus onUnited
Slates Senator to-morrow night. This
was the time originally fixed, but in the
last-day or two there had been differences '
among the supporters of candidates re
garding the expediency of having a cau
cus in advance of. the joint session of the
which is to be held a week from to-mor
row. The caucus agreement is claimed as
a victory lor Alderman Madden, who*
wanted an early date. The nnti-Madden
men brought out a new Senatorial candi
date to-day, William H. Harper of Chi
cago, who was formerly a member of the
Legislature. ,
The committee of Chicago citizens, who
are here working night and day to accom
plish the deieat of the leader of Chicago's
Common Council, declare that they have
no candidate and are against Madden on
principle only. After a meeting this after
noon they made the positive statement
that Madden was beaten ; that he had only
43 votes to Mason's 52, Hitt and Carr hav
ing 9 each, Allerton 4, doubtful 9, with
Allerton and Mason leanings. The Cook
County machine, which' is behind* Mad

SHERMAN'S SUCCESSOR.
Governor Bushnell's aspirations and the
Opposition to Him.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 13.â Senator
Sherman, if report from Canton be true,
will enter President McK.nley's Cabinet
March 4, 1897. The Ohio Legislature will
not be in session at the time and the va
cancy will be filled by Governor Bushnell.
The Governor is at his home in Spring
field, quite ill. The condition that now
confronts him has been anticipated, but
he has not publicly expressed himself as
to what action he would take. Though
he has recently stated that he was a can
didate for re-election as Governor this
year, and not for the Senate, it is gener
ally expected that after he is elected Gov
ernor he will come out as a candidate to
succeed Sherman for the regular term in
the Senate.
If he should appoint Hanna to the
short term it would make him a formida
ble opponent lor the regular term. It is
expected that Bushnell will appoint State
Chairman Kurtz to the vacancy. Kurtz
will be witling to stand aside at the end of
the short term and let his chief succeed
to the regular term without opposition.
To shut Bushnell out of the race for the
Senate the Sherman Republicans have
proposed to have the candidate for â¢ the
Senate nominated by the Stale convention
at the same time the candidate for Gov
ernor is selected. Governor Bushnell can
not accept both nominations at the same
time with good grace.

in session from 1 o'clock p. m. till 5:30 p. m.
to-day, when its labors ended. The session
was largely occupied in discussing an ad
dress to the public. This document, of
about 800 words, was issued over the signa
ture of Jacob S. Coxey as chairman of the
conference. The reforms advocated are the
imperative mandate to legislators for non
interest bearing bonds, direct legislation,
good roads and the economic ballot. The
Populist leaders of tbe last campaign are
arraigned as corrupt. , "3?Â®SosSfi
. An organization committee was chosen,
of which J. S. Coxey is chairman and Carl-

Criticized. ff^

Their Treatment of the Cuban

-to . Congress.
Bold Usurpation of Power That
Properly Belongs to the National
Lawmakers- '
' WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. , 13.-The
Senate spent the first two hours of to
day's session behind closed doors' in the
consideration of executive business (the
extradition treaties with Argentina and
tne Orange, Republic) and tbe remainder
of the day was occupied in the delivery of
a speech by Bacon (D.) of Georgia on the
question of whether the recognition of a
new power was an executive or a legisla
tive act. His contention" was that it was
a legislative functionâ one exclusively for
determination by. Congress. Even where
the recognition was by the President its
validity. Bacon argued, was derived from
the assent of Congress, either direct or
implied. If the President had such ex
clusive power it. was greater than any
which, any constitutional monarch
wielded. .Never, Bacon said, was a chal
lenge of power more sharply made than
that made by the Secretary of State in the
matter, and never *,' was defiance of au
thority more boldly given.
Bacon confined himself to the consti
tutional and legal points in the argument,
refraining from every allusion to the prac
tical question of recognizing tbe republic
of Cuba. He' said that in December last
he had introduced a concurrent resolution
which had been referred to the Judiciary
Committee, declaring that the question of
the recognition by this Government of
any people as a free and independent na
tion is one exclusively for the determina
tion of Congress. As he could not call up
his own resolution, he would make Mr.
Mills' resolution the text of his remarks.
When the act of recognition was by the
President, it derived its validity from the
assent of Congress, either direct or im
plied. His proposition was this: That
the ultimate power to determine whether
a nation should or should not be recog
nized was in the law-making branch of
the Government, and when that branch,
in full knowledge of what is going on,
permits the executive to act in the mat
ter, it is a confirmation of the President's
act.
White (D.) of California put the case of
the recognition by the President of a
Minister representing a new Government,
and asked Bacon whether that recogni
tion was final arid bound Congress and
country., ....
[ Bacon gave a . decidedly negative re
sponse, and when Hale (R.) of Maine fol
lowed ;up j White's , question by. asking
.whether. Congr might order such Min
ister to be sent home. Bacon's response in
the affirmative was equally positive.
:.) "'The Secretary of State," Bacon con
tinued, "has denied the power of Con
gress, has defied its authority and has
proclaimed through the press to foreign
nations that even if such proposed action
shall be placed on the statute-book in the
form of law the President will not obey
it. He has practically threatened Con
gress with the veto of the President, ana
has added that if passed over the veto it
will be thrown back in the face of Con
gress as so much waste paper. Never was
a challenge of power more sharply made.
Never was "defiance of authority more
boldly given."
Bacon spoke for nearly three hours,
most of the speech being delivered from
manuscript. The Mills resolutions remain
on the table. .
Gear (R.) of lowa, chairman of the Pa
cific Railroads Committee,. introduced a
bill, which was referred to that commit
tee, appointing the Secretary of the Treas
ury, the Secretary of the Interior and the
Attorney-General a committee to settle
the indebtedness of the bond-aided Pacific
railroads to the Government.
1 On motion of Pettigrew (Pop.) of South
Dakota it was ordered that the House bill
for homesteads on lands acquired from
Indians shall be voted on at 4 o'clock to
morrow.
Morrill (R.) of Vermont, from the Li
brary Committee, reported a concurrent
resolution that the library building
should not be used or occupied for any
purpose other than those legitimately
connected with the library.
Hale objected to the immediate consid
eration oi the resolution and it went over
until to-morrow. k
Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada offered a reso
lution, which was aureed to, Instructing
the committee o** mines and mining to
examine a report as to the best method of
gathering statistics of : the products of
mines in the United States.
The : asking of permission 'by Allen
(Pop.) ot Nebraska to correct a substitute
nead in his speech as published in the
Record afforded the presiding officer, Mr.
Hill, the chance of potting the question
in these words: "Is there objection to
striking out the successes and failures of
Mark Hanna?" There was a laugh, but
no objection.

Major McKinley would be" 'glad to know
whether he would be inclined to accept a

clinations were not in that direction orig
inally, and his first thought was, accord

main in the Senate; but after careful
consideration of the subject it seems to
him that he can perhaps be of more ser

CLEVELAND. Ohio, Jan. 13.â Mark

I will leave Cleveland until 1 leave for the
inauguration. At least, .l hope that noth
ing will come up that will necessitate my
going away. Ido not expect to be able to
attend the Marquette Club banquet at
Chicago. I will not go to ' Washington

go there two or three, days before in order
to be on hand when he arrives. < I have
some business to look- after in Washing
ton and will settle it up in the interim be
fore Mr. McKinley's arrival. .
"Relative to my Health, I will say that I
do not relish having it made the subject
of widespread comment. It does no good ;
only excites uncalled for anxiety on the
part of my friends. While my, physical
condition has not been oi the best lately.
I am far from i collape. A severe cold
lias been sticking to me, and this coupled
with a nervous trouble, probably brought
on by close attention to my work, has sort
of run me down, still I have not allowed
the indisposition to interfere with my be
ing at work in my office every day. I al
ready feel improved in both body and
spirits, and. will be myself in a day or two.
This is the extent of my ailment and there
is no cause for alarm among my friends
for fear that I am prone to a collapse. *'â¢â .â¢'-â 
"Relative to Grosvenor's claims that
Sherman has been slated for the State

Up to Specifications.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 13.-Naval
Constructor Dashiell, member of the steel
board, has returned from Bethlehem, Pa.,
where he examined the plates made for
the battle-ship Wisconsin, now under con
struction at San Francisco.' He found
them fully up to specifications, so there
will be mo delay on that vessel. Con
structor Dashiell will now go to Newport
News, where the work on the battle-ships
Kecrsarge and , Kentucky /,Is. practically
suspended on account of tests which cast
doubt on the quality of all the. steel fur
nished. It is believed that the methods
of working the plates into those -ships is
as much at fault as the plates themselves,
and the constructor hones to devise some
method by which sufficient good material
out of the hundreds of tons on hand may
be selected and the work continued, while
the steel contractors are given an oppor
tunity to make good the deficiency. The
steel board will consider Constructor
Daohiell's report on Friday, and there is
a* likelihood that construction may he re
sumed at Newport News next week.
Agricultural . Appropriations,
. WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 13.â The
agricultural .appropriation bill was pre

chairman of the Committee on Agricul

--152,752, an increase of $102,080 over the
amount appropriated for the current fiscal
year. The only material increase is un
der the head of the bureau of animal in
dustry and is intended to allow the exten
sion of meat. inspection. The committee
discussed the question of compulsory meat
inspection, but decided to make it the
subject of an independent bill and' not to
place it in the appropriation bill. ; For the
purchase and distribution of r valuable
seeds an appropriation of $120,000 is made,
and .the Secretary is directed- to expend
the appropriation. Secretary Morton
made no estimate for this expenditure
and, jas in former bills, it ' was - inserted
without his sanction.

PROSPECTS FOR
PEACE IN CUBA
An Official ! From Madrid
Said to Be on the Way
to Washington.
Has Full Authority to Negotiate
a Settlement on the Basis
of Reforms.
Proposed Treaty cf Commerce With
the United States to Open Up the
Island's Markets.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 13.â The Daily
News will to-morrow publish a dispatch
from its Paris correspondent saying that
the idea is gaining in Madrid that the
establishment of peace in Cuba is destined
to be accomplished at no very distant
day.
A Government official, the dispatch
asserts, has started from Madrid for Wash
ington, traveling incognito, with full
authority from Prime Minister Canovas
del Castillo and the Duke of Tetuan,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, to privately
negotiate a settlement of the Cuban
question on the basis of reforms in Cuba
and a treaty of commerce with the United
States in behalf of the island, which will
open the markets of the latter to foreign
competition except in cotton product and
a few other articles of which Spain will
try to keep a monopoly for Barcelona
manufacturers.
â  Senor Canovas, according to the News
correspondent, is evidently trying the
effect of peaceful negotiations before the
opening of the Cortes.
WAR IO THE EXD.
Xothing Short of Absolute Independence
Will Pacify the Cubans.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 13.â A Wash
ington dispatch to the Sun says: Senor
Quesada, the charge d'affaires of the
Cuban Legation, states that the persistent
reports that General Gomez is making
proposals for the settlement of the war is
just as untrue as the dispatches from
Madrid representing that the offer of
mediation by the United States has been
accepted. .'. * ; Â/j
Senor Quesada said: "There is no truth
in any of those assertions. They are sent out
merely as a part of the Spanish policy to
delay the, inevitable outcome of the war.
There is not a Cuban on the island, nor in
this country, who does not know that any
thing less than absolute independence for
Cuba means a continuation of the ruinous
rule which has opposed its people and
which has caused this war, as it did the
one which preceded it.
"Maximo Gomez is the last man in the
world to be a suppliant for Spanish mercy.
He is a soldier without fear and is in
spired with the most devout confidence in
the success of the cause he is so valiant in
upholding. ! Even now, while the Spanish,
are filling the newspapers w.tb these alle
gations about the desire for peace on other
terms than absolute independence, he is
having read to his army and to the com
mands of other leaders the declaration
that was issued by Jose Marti and him
self in April, 1895. â¢
"That has become the gossip of every
patriot who is struggling in behalf of
Cuban liberty, and you might as well try
to make a devout Christian deny his Bible
as to endeavor to make a Cuban disregard
the words of Marti or Gomez." ..V;
i ; A member of the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations, when asked yesterday
as to the truth' of the report that Spain is
preparing to grant antononiy to. Cuba,
said :
"Why, as to the autonomy of Cuba,
that is merely an iridescent dream. In
other words, it *is nonsense ; nothing but
independence can be granted to Cuba now,
and she will accept nothing less."
â¢ The delegation of Afro- Americans ap
pointed at the mass-meeting of Cuban
sympathizers in New York City on De
cember 18, to lay before Congress the reso
lutions then adopted have arrived in
Washington, and will appear before the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
to-day, and before the House committee
Thursday. The , members will pledge to
the Cuban cause the patriotic services of
20,000 men of African descent in case the
Spanish Government should make war
upon the United States as a result of the
interference of the Government in behalf
of Cuba.
WLTLER'S DKSPERATIOX.
Freely Using the 'lurch to Aid Hia Task
of Conquest.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 13.â A Ha
vana special to the Sun says: General
Weyler continues the war of extermina
tion and destruction which, in his opin
ion, will end- in the pacification of the
island. From Governea to Tumbadero, a
distance of ten miles in Havana province,
many farms have been burned by the
Spanish troops. This means a "loss . of
$500,000 worth of property and the misery
of hundreds of families.
Weyler attributes these outrages to the
insurgent band, though everybody knows
they are the work of Spanish columns un
der the special instructions of the Captain
General.
A farmer of Governea, whose small
property was reduced to ashes and who,
was deprived of aU resources, with -a wife
and six children to support, said that the
columns are preceded by bands of torch-'
men, who kindle fires on every side after
plundering the houses. The farmers and
their families are taken before the chiefs
of , the columns and threatened with
death.
The. Spaniards say that they do not
want the 'people to live in : the country,
but to gather in the towns, no matter how
poor they are or how much they need the
produce of their farms for. their daily
sustenance. MBSj^Bt*-*P^M
If any one dares to protest against , liv
ing in .the towns because he has nothing
to live on there he is immediately killed.
The result of this barbarous policy is the
re-enforcement of the insurgent army by
hundreds of recruits daily, who are obliged
to choose between starvation In the cities
or fighting against those who destroy
their means of gaining a livelihood. \ :
Governea is a station on the United
Railway of Havana, and the farms which
surround it are - mostly tobacco planta
tions. Weyler's â'. oobjectt t in ordering the
destruction of all that part of the country
is to deprive, the insurgent bands of Ha
vana province of food resources, as he be
lieves â¢. they live on what the farmers pro
vide them. ~ â¢ â¢.'-'; ..',,
This policy: irritates the Spaniards in
Havana who own property in the country
or are interested in agriculture.
It is perfectly trae that they are trying
to influence Madrid to recall Weyler.
But they do > not dare to freely express
their o- inions, as they fear the resent
ment of the Spanish immigrants, who
highly approve of Weyler's system of ex*
terminating the natives.
II A VAX A IS IX PERIL.
Fierce Fighting Xear the City Causes the
Greatest Consternation.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 14.â A special
cable to the Sun from Havana says: The
war is going on so fiercely around the city
of Havana tbat General Arolas has estab
lished his headquarters at Guanabacoa,
with a force of over 5000 men besides
those already there.
The capital is in constant commotion
over the bold attacks made on the suburbs
by the insurgents.* San Miguel delPadron,
a town near Guanabacoa, and San Fran
cisco de Paula, have been burned by the
Cubans after severe engagements in which
the Spanish troops were compelled to re
tire.
Every one here is astounded at all this
and in fear of a raid upon the capital it
self.
To-day eight persons were killed in cold
blood. With them was a son of the well
known American citizen, Mr. Hyatt, and
he saved his life at the last moment by
asserting his nationality.
The commander of the detachment
which executed the eight Cubans ap
peared to hesitate about young Hyatt. At
last the commander sai I : "Let him go to
avoid complications. It would be a pity
to have some diplomatic imbroglio that
might stop this nice work."
COMMh.STS OX IHE IRE ATT.
Secretary Olney's Stock Serins to Hate
Gone Up in London.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 13.â St. James
Gazette says that although it has been the
fashion in England to scoff at Secretary
Olney as an amateur diplomat he seems
likely to leave a mark upon the interna
tional system of the civilized world.
Referring to the reply which Secretary
Olney is alleged to have made to the
Russian Minister at Washington, in
answer to the question whether the treaty
was offensive and defensive, that in the
ordinary diplomatic acceptance of tie
term it is not a treaty of defense and
offense, but an agreement with Great
Britain in support of the Monroe doctrine,
the St. James Gazette cays: The assump
tion is somewhat hastily made that the
United States will exchange her tradi
tional friendship for Russia for a close
general alliance with England. We could
wish for nothing better, and would bo
prepared to recognize almost anything in
reason if it could get the two great na
tions of Anglo-Saxon stock into line
against the world.
The Morning Post regards the treaty as
rather experimental, and takes excep
tions to article VIII of the agreement,
providing for the appointment as one of
arbitrators of a judicial cfficer of any
State or Territory involved in a question
at issue. "As American politics is con
stituted," the paper adds, "there may
always be an anti- British element on this
tribunal on any question affecting do
minion or frontier."
The Chronicle prints an interview with
Hon. Richard K. Dobell. Speaker of the
Canadian House of Commons, in which he
says that Canada would rejoice at the
completion of the Anglo-American arbi
tration treaty, and that the present Cana
dian Cabinet would do everything possi
ble to complete the good work, so that
Canadians as well as Englishmen will live
with the United States as friends.
The Paris correspondent of the Daily
News says that France is rife for a similar
agreement with the United States.
' A Berlin dispatch to the Standard says
it is not likely that the Continental
powers will enter into an arbitration
agreement with the American Republic.
The Boersen , Courier , expresses the
opinion that the treaty imposes such obli
gations upon the United States as should
prevent her from tolerating future fili
bustering expeditions to Cuba.

SALT LAKE, Utah, Jan. 13.â The joint

33, Dubois (silver Republican) 3, Jones
(D.) 14, Nelson (Pop.) 8, Johnson (D.) 9,
scattering 3; necessary to a choice, 38.
The Claggett men wanted to take
another ballot right away, but failed to
carry their point. Most of the twenty
live silver Republicans who voted for
Dubois on the first ballot taken on Tues
day divided their votes between the two
Democrats to-day. It is generally con

the Claggett men declare that in the next
ballot to-morrow their candidate wiil re
ceive more than the necessary thirty-sis

profess to believe that the next ballot will
show a concentration on Johnson, arid
that he will, if not elected, receive enough

gaining strength with the Populists.
Forty-two have signed an agreement to
vote only for a Populist, and most strenu

UKIAH MURDER TRIAL.
Witnesses Testify . Against John Dodge,
Accused of the Mudgett
Murder.
UKIAH, Cal., . Jan. 13.â The trial of
John Dodge, charged with the murder of
J. A. H. Mudgett, . the wealthy Usal
rancher, attracts large crowds to the Su
perior Court. The first witness called this
morning was Mars W. Stone, who testi
fied to the finding of what appeared to be
Mudsett's body in the ruins of his cabin,
which had been destroyed by fire. He
identified the frame of a rifle as one he
had found at the scene of the crime, and
which was the property of Mudgett.
Perry F. Bowman and his wife testified
that Dodsre visited them about noon on
the day of the crime. He departed about
3 o'clock that afternoon. Dodge returned
an hour later for some powder for his
shotgun. This was given to him and he
loaded the weapon with buckshot.
Deputy Sheriff Martin Hart gave the
details of the confession made by Dodge
to him.
Testimony given to-day showed that
buckshot similar to those found in the
undischarged barrel of Dodge's shotgun
were found in the fence near Mudgett's
house, and this would tend to disprove
! the contention of . the defendant that the
shooting occurred in the house. The shot
is of a peculiar kind, having been molded
by Dod-re himself.
Mrs. Dodge, who is to bo tried as an
accessory after the fact, is now at the Pal
ace hotel, seriously ill.

after an hour's deliberation it 'awarded

libel was spoken in the French language,
which caused some novel points to.be

SUES HIS WIFE
FOR AGENT'S FEES
Novel Action Brought by a
Stockton Real Estate
Dealer.
>-' - '
Demands Heavy Remuneration
lor Services Rendered His
Better Half.
Believes Hj Should Be Recompensed
for' Managing Her Property
Interests.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 13.â A rather
sensational action was commenced to-day
in the Superior Court by W. E. Carter
against his wife, Mary B. Carter. Carter
is a member of the real estate firm of
Henderson & Carter, and sues for $3000
for managing his wife's property interests
during the past two years. He alleges
that his services as business manager,
agent and broker during that time named
are reasonably worth that sum, and that
be has never been paid a cent for his
labors in looking after the property of his
better half." r
Until recently Carter and his wife have
lived amicably, but several days ago they
had some differences, and the suit is the
outgrowth of her refusal to pay anything
for managing her estate. Mrs. Carter was
formerly Mrs. J. H. Tarn, wife of the ex-
Police Judge, who is now a racehorse
owner of San Francisco. Before that she
was the wife of Dr. Odell, and inherited a
fortune from, the Moss estate. Carter is
her fourth husband, as she was a widow
when Dr. "Odell married, her. Odell was
killed by her brother, but he was acquitted
by a jury. Â» *Â», 'y-j;
Mrs. Carter is very wealthy, owning a
great deal cf property in thU county. She
married Carter in the East a few years
ago. It- is believed that a suit tor divorce
will follow the action brought to-day.
MISSING 1 FROM ASTORIA.
Ex-Sheriff Smith Disappears for the Sec-
ond t Time From His Oregon
.-,.;. Â ; Home.
: PORTLAND. Ob., Jan. 13 .âEx-Sheriff
Harry Smith, of Astoria, who a year ago
suddenly left his â¢ family, has again dis
appeared. He is one of the best known
and most popular men in the Northwest
and his doings for the past year or more
are a mystery to his most intimate friends.
His former disappearance was extremely
sensational. Coming to Portland with
some thousands of dollars he fell in with
fast company and while intoxicated his
money was stolen. Ashamed to return
and face his creditors Smith made his
way to Antwerp, Belgium.
- Some months after his departure a let
ter couched in piteous language, purport
ing to have.been received from Smith, was
.published in ah Astoria paper. This letter
had quite an effect in softening public
opinion toward the man, and later he re
turned. Since his arrival in Astoria, fol
lowing his escapade, friends and creditors
have done everything possible to assist
him in regaining his former high position
in the community.
Smith received $000 on Saturday as the
result of . a compromise of his claim
against Clatsop County for the collection
of delinquent taxes.
This money he was to have distributed
among - his creditors, but instead he
brought it with him to Portland. Since
then he has not been seen in Astoria. A
; friend of Smith's said:
"As a matter of fact, he has never re
covered his old-time confidence since com
ing backâ has never been able to feel the
same. 1 bave noticed that when meeting
some one whom be had known before, for
the first lime since coming back, he would
flush as though with shame. Possibly
this feeling has worn upon him until it
becoming unbearable he has taken this
money and sought some place where he
would be among strangers."
INSPECT SAN DIEGO'S HARBOR.
Government Commissioners See /Is Waters
Calm While a Storm Rages
at Sea. -
SAN DIIiGO. Cal., Jan. 13.â The United
States Harbor Commission arrived to-day
at noon and, accompanied by local officials,
left on the Ladrona to inspect the harbor,
jatty and coast defenses. Tha inspection
was made under favorable circumstances,
notwithstanding that a storm was raging
outside. Not the slightest effect of the
blow was felt by the shipping in the bay.
The' members of the commission remarked
this fact.
After inspecting the bay and harbor the
commission visited Coronado Island,
where, accompanied by Â£*. S. Babcock of
the IIotÂ»l del Coronado, it boarded a train
for the Zuninga jetty at the mouth of the
harbor, on the eastern side. The visitors
viewed the work of constructing the jetty,
and also of the outward protecting wing,
which, when completed; will be 300 feet
in length. The jetty will be about 7000
feet long, and : is about half completed.
Part of the duty of the commission is to
report upon the probable effect the jetty
will have upon the harbor, and to what
extent it will likely deepen the main en-,
trance. Admiral Walker said to The Call
"Our visit has no particular significance.
We came merely to examine the harbor,
the nature of the coast defences, and to es
timate the probable effect of the jetty,
when completed, upon the harbor. I
cannot give an idea as to the probable na
ture of our repoit; our visit will in no
wise affect our report on Santa Monica
and San Pedro harbors."

His. Reason. Dethroned by Illness and
Worry Over a Seamen's
Strike.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Jan. 13.â
Captain D. Nichol of the British bark
Scottish Isles is missing, and every in
dication points to suicide. Since the ar
rival of his vessel some weeks ago it has
been a well known though suppressed
fact along the front that he was not en
tirely sane. A fever from which he had
suffered seemed to affect his brain. The
vessel loaded lumber at Port Bia keley for
Deiagoa Bay, South Africa, and - was
towed to Port Townsend Monday. Since
its arrival, nine of the crew refused to do
duty and it is supposed that worry over
this fact coupled with imaginary griev
ances dethroned Captain Nichols* reason.
â¢ The last seen of the unfortunate man
was last night at 12 o'clock. It is con
cluded that he came on deck during the
night and in a moment of temporary ab
erration jumped into the chilly waters of
Townsend Bay.-- The * unfortunate event
has cast deep gloom over the entire water
front, where Captain Nichol was known
as an able, sober and industrious mariner.
CONTRADICTS MR. MONEY.
Architect Wood Says Affairs Are Not as
Bad in Cuba as Stated by the
Congressman.
. NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 13.â The rep
resentations of Hernando de Soto
Money, member of Congress and Senator
elect from Mississippi, as to the state of
affairs in Cuba are pronounced to be in
correct in many details by A. J. Wood, an
architect of 153 Broadway, who was in
Cuba at the time of Mr. Moneys visit
and has personally investigated the situa
tion there.
"1 cannot see how an educated man
carrying the passport of another nation
and asking protection and receiving it
can so degrade himself as to publish state
ments that will work injury without first
determining upon the possible reliability
of the souice of which his information
comes,"
Wood's business affairs have taken him
to Cuba every year but one since 1886 and
he is personally known to many Cubans.
During his last visit to the island, which
terminated suddenly January 2, four days
after Mr. Moneys arrival in Havana, he
traversed in safety a part of the territory
which Mr. Money has declared to be un
safe and at the mercy of the insurgents,
and investigated for himself the reported
massacre of pacificos at Guanabacoa
which has been cited by Mr. Money as an
instance of- Spanish atrocity. Concern
ing this he said:
â  "Mr. Money states that only a few days
before his arrival the insurgents, three
nights in succession, attacked the city of
Guanabacoa of 5000 inhabitants, within
four or five miles of the city of Havana,
and burned twenty-five houses, and that
they were unopposed by Weyler's troops.
"Now," said Wood, "I learned beyond a
shadow of a doubt that not more than two
insurgents were killed, and yet by tbe re
port given by- Money it appears that he
added of his own volition nine persons to
the list of the dead as it was irrespOn
sively estimated at first. The inference
Mr. Money makes concerning the prev
alence of epidemics and the inadequacy
of the Spanish hospital service is not
borne out by my observations. . I was in
Havana eleven days and saw but two of
the yellow smallpox flags. The disease is
not known to be epidemic in Havana
now. Yellow fever always exists in Ha
vana to some extent, but it is not espe
cially prevalent now."

was rudely shaken, as were a number of
other structures. Reports have come in

north and south of here and all 'tell the

SAVED FROM A PAUPER'S GRAVE.
L M. Fletcher of San Francisco Figures
in the Closing Chapter of His
Uncle's Career.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 13.â Thomas Hen
dricks, 70 years old, who died at the
County Hospital December 31, has been
saved from a pauper's grave by his
nephew, L. M. Fletcher of San Francisco.
Thirty years , ago Hendricks was a broker
in Wall street and; was the friend of such
men as Jay Gould, Russell Sage and Jim
Fisk. He was known as a daring spec
ulator and carried through many deals of
importance. 'â * '
... He me: with reverses, and then became
estranged from his family. * About twenty
years ago he came to Chicago and had
lived here ever since. The loss of his for
tune and standing in society caused Hen
dricks to take to drink, and for many
years he had experienced the bitter side
of life. He was proud, however, and
would not accept charity from those who
knew him in. better days. He worked at
anything he could get. For a time he de
livered hats for a firm in Monroe street.
Of late years he had worked in hotels as
storekeeper and also at the house-painting
trade.
On December 26 be was found uncon
scious in his room at the Southern Hotel,
where he was employed as custodian of
the building. He was taken to the Coun
ty Hospital by the police and never re
gained consciousness. A man who knew
some of Hendricks' history called upon
Undertaker Roberts, 11 Adams street, a
few days ago and told him that Hendricks
had a nephew in San Francisco. This
relative was L. M. Fletcher, general
Pacific Coast freight agent of the Missouri
Pacific Railway Company. Fletcher was
telegraphed rsgarding the disposal of the
body of his uncle, and â he replied that be
wished his uncle to have a decent burial
and he would defray th? expenses..
Hendricks was born in Vermont and be
longed to one of the best families in the
Green Mountain State. He received ex
ceptional educational advantages and
when he went to Boston, at the age of 20,
he was well equipped for the battle of the
world. He* lived in Boston a few years
and then went to New York, where he
drifted into the brokerage business. For
ten years he was a well-known figure in
Wall street and was considered wealthy.
Through the bad judgment of his partner
he lost his fortune, and then he became a
WAnderer.'^|923M9HSÃHP'^BÃ
Mr. Hendricks leaves a . widow, three
daughters and one son in Boston. â¢ Mrs.
Hendricks and one of her daughters are in
Europe at present. He also had a sister,

So Smooth Sailing in the Senate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 13â Private
talks with Senators on the general treaty

Senators of influence on account of the
fact that boundary matters are included
in the general treaty. The committee will
probably take up the convention at its
meeting to-morrow. The members say
that the document will be carefully con
sidered both in committee and in the Sen
ate, and there will be no haste in taking
tbe final vote of ratification. The debate
promises to be somewhat protracted, and
.here are Senators who predict that there
will be no action on the subject at this

Struggle With the Elements.
HALIFAX, N. S., Jan. 13.â The dis
abled steamer Durham City and the
steamer Damarari, by which she waa be
ing towed into Halifax, have had a ter
rible struggle with the elements off this
harbor all day. The battle has apparently
ended in the Damarari herself being tem
porarily crippled, but owing to the dark
ness and distance from the city this can
not be confirmed. The most furious
snowstorm of the winter has raged from
early morning, when the two steamers
were approaching the harbor, until tbis
afternoon, and a fierce gale blew on the
coast. â¢ V -

,Stations Are Finer Than Those of the

No trains in California stop at finer
depots than the silver-lettered, lemon
* colored coaches of the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Railroad. The new
depots are painted a buff or a dark-lemon
color. There is a natural fitness of things
in these colors, for are not the products of
the soil in which the stations stand lemons
aud oranges? And do not the trains of
the Valley road "flash through groves of

New combination passenger and freight
"depots, or freight depots only, are already

*." "-The- average depots of the railroads of
the .United States do not begin to compare
'â¢'.with those of the Valley road. They are
'". iftnely finished inside and out. well-lighted
and warm in the winter season. The
depot 'at Escalon shows the general style,
"a 'summer waiting-room at the end, re?
sembling a port cocbere, in which seats
will be placed in the summer season. The
aiyte'of architecture of these stations is
Spanish, or rather the old mission style,
< and in this the management of the road
' has reproduced nnd preserved the distin
' j guishing style of buildings in California in
.- eaTly â¢ days. Depots are already com
â¢ pleted, or nearly completed, at Escalon,
* E'rnwood, Le Grande, Lankershim, which
. is frle-station for Madera two miles away,
Merced, ( Geneva and Marguerite. The
" depots cost about $4000 each. Brick pas
'* senger depots will be erected at Fresno
and Merc d in addition to the freight
depots. The freight depot at Fresno is
/brick, aad is now nearly completed. It is
tiie ultimate intention to cultivate little
â¢â¢'park* around these depots. Eventually a
liandsome depot will be erected at Stock
â¢ton.
There will soon b? a revival in construe
, tion work on the Valley Railroad. This
â¢ will be on the extension from Fresno, the
; present southern terminus, to Bakersfield.

GUMPER WAS " THERE."
A NimbiÂ© ex-* ire man Rinks Life and
Limb to Extinguish a Fire in the
"C'a'.l" Handing.
A lively, blaze on a high story of the
mammoth new Call building on the cor
ner of Market and Third streets attracted
wide attention last night. About 7:30
o'clock up in the midst of the great steel
rafters a bright giare was seen, apparently
spreading in the direction of the immense
derrick used for hoist) material to the
Upper floors.
Among the spectators who observed the
glare was J. Gumper, a mechanic of this
City and ex-railroad ; fireman. He was
not willing to stand impassively by, as he
readily conceived what damage might re
sult. "Hurriedly he took means to break
in the door leading to the building f rem
the street and, without pausing, started to
scale the heights toward the fire. By
means of ladders and agile ciambering he
passed from story to story, closely watched
lv the admiring crowd below.
â  When he reached the eleventh story Mr.
lumper found that the strange fire had
thready' made considerable headway. It
had evidently caught from the >" small
furnace used by the mechanics *of the
builoiug, and had communicated to the
tcolchest in the- immediate vicinity, which
was burning briskly.-- As be; looked
through the blinding smoke and showers
of .-"parks he saw that there was imminent
danger of the fiery element spreading to
guy ropes sustaining .* the heavy derrick
erected in the middle of the structure, and
his mind speedily leaped to , the serious
consequences of the fall of that heavy
timber. '
Without hesitation Mr. Gumper rushed
forward and proceeded by all means in his
power to extinguish the flames. A chem
ical en-inc arrived on the scene at this,
time, and between the effect of its well
directed stream and Mr. Gumper s efforts
the threatening blaze was extinguished.
Mr. Gumper escaped with torn raiment
and a slight scorching.
POPDLISTIO WOES.
The Discordant KtÂ«-*monts to Bo Har
monized by "Boss" Haskell.
It is now a pretty well acknowledged
fact in Populistic circles that Burnette G.
Haskell occupies the position of "boss."
Mr. Haskell modestly admits as much
himself. His position seems likely to prove
no sinecure. ,
First of all. the opposition say, he will
have to harmonize two discordant factions
in the party, and next he will have to en
tice the white-winged dove of peace to
hover over, some discordant elements in
the faction of which he is the head.
That this is no small task in itself is
evidenced by the fact that * reputable
leaders of the party, among whom may
be enumerated such men as Taylor Roaers,
Dr. G. W. Day wait and E. S. Barney, have
threatened to withdraw from active co
operation with him.
Then there is J. H. Tingman, lately
elected treasarer of the Populist County
Committee, as a moral exoneration from
certain charges made by John C. Gore. .
Mr. Tins man occupies the unique posi
tion of being the only fusion man per
mtted office under the Haskell regime.
As such comes under the special super-
vision of Mr. Haskell, and later develop
ments are eagerly awaited.
Ail conservative men of the party be
wail the sad fix it is now in.
CHAMPIONS TOM AND JOE
Sharkey and McAuliffe Will
Box in the Country
Towns.
Silver Cups Will Be Offered as Prizes
to the Boys Who Will Spar
fcr Pants.
Thomas Sharkey, the champion tuigilist
of the American navy, and Joseph Tanner
McAuliffe, the champion heavy-weight
pugilist of American tanneries, have signed
articles of agreement to leave this City at
an early date with the avowed intention
of taking the cities and towns of Califor
nia by surprise.
It is said that Sharkey is taking light
exercise somewhere in the immediate
vicinity of Vallejo, and that Tanner Joe
has already got himself into prime con
dition after a course of heavy training in
tne immediate vicinity of Braweryville,
San Mateo County.
The articles read that Tom and Jerry, or
rather Joe, will visit the principal cities of
the State and afford the natives an oppor
tunity of seeing how two noted gladiators
can tap each other with five-ounce gloves
without the painful necessity ot having to
score a knockout. v / '.'
After engaging in a four-round bout, the
fistic celebrities will further astonish the
natives in exhibitions of bag-punching, at
which game they are said to ba very ex
perienced, especially big Joe, who is as
flash as a cat on his pins and fearfully ag
gressive as a bag puncher.
Sharkey has thoroughly mastered a
cute little speech which was written by
Sharpshooter Earp. His explanation of
that foul alow which won the champion
sailor pugilist $10,000 recently, much to
the chagrin o! a man named Fitzsim
mons, who figured on the capture of , the
big purse long before he had the pleasure
of meeting Mr. Sharkey in battle array. â¢
These beautiful siver- cups, with Cham
pion Sharkey's name engraved thereon,
were "built" for a purpose which has been
kept a secret until now. Mr. Sharkey
wisely concluded to part with some of his
hard-earn.d money in the purchase of sil
verware, because he had an object in view.
Tbe cups will be offered as prizes ; for the
young men of the country who will en
gage in our round-boxing bouts at each
performance which will be given by
Champions Tom and Joe.
it is said that Sharkey regrets the fact
tbat when ordering the cups he .made one
great mistake. He intended to have his
picture stamped on them, "but in the hurry
of the moment, he forgot that; important,
direction, and now his heart is conse
quently sad and pensive, but Tom is san-
I guine, nevertheless, that the ,-â¢ boys ; of s the
country whose proclivities are sportive,
will thorougbly appreciate ; the kindness
of the champion in offering such beautiful
prizes for the encouragement of fistic sport
in the bucolic districts.

W. R. Townsend Writes of the
Development of Pacific Cca^t
Interests in Japan.
. The board of trustees of the Chamber of
Commerce held '. its regular session yester
day afternoon. Several impoitant ques
tions came up for consideration, among
them being that of placing 2CO additional
boys in the training school at Mare Island.
The Chamber of Commerce has taken
great interest in this question, but, 'its
efforts will necessarily cease at this time,
owing to the receipt of a letter from F. M.
Ramsey/Bureau of Navigation, U. S. N.
Ramsey's letter was addressed to Jobn L.
Howard, vice-president of the chamber,
and reads as follows:
Washington, D. C, Dec. 17, 1896.
Sir: Your letter ol the 23d ult. to the Secre
tary of the Navy, regarding the desire of . the
Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco that
orders be issued for an enlistment at Mare
Island ol 200 additional boys, has been re
ceived. In reply I have the honor to state
th it there is not sufficient accommodation at
Mare Island lor this number of boys. As soon
us the boys who are now there about 100â
can be accommodated in a training vessel,
which, is hoped, will soon occur, instruc
tions will be given lor the establishment of an
other huuarcd. It ls the desire of the depart
ment to enlist and train boys on the Pacific
Coast in sufficient numbers to meet all the re
quirements of the Pacific ana Asiatic stations.
V--F. M. Ramsey of the Bureau ot Navigation.
. A letter was received from W. R. Town
send, agent of the Bureau of Foreign Com
merce in Japan, reporting favorable
progress and the development of the com
mercial interests of the Pacific Coast since
his arrival.
The sum of $100 was appropriated for
the Council of Associated Industries to as
sist it in paying the expense of keeping an
attorney at Sacramento to urge the pas-
sage of certain bills in which: it is inter
ested. ?3*gÃÃflJpMÃjtejM
The president of the Chamber of Com
merce of this City was, by letter from the
Chamber of Commerce of Paris, France,
appointed an honorary member of that
body.
Action was taken ;in favor of Federal
control of t_o quarantine system ot. this
port.
The trustees decided to c*Â»ll a special
meeting of citizens for next Tuesday at 1
p. M. at Chamber of Commerce halt to take
action in favor of prompt legislation to
secure construction of the Nicaragua canal.
A teleerram was read from certain per
sons in New York urgine ' the chamber to
act in favor of the arbitration treaty with
Great Britain now before the Senate. The
trustees wired for further information, it
being their opinion that such a treaty
should not be ratified by the Senate with
out a change in respect to the permanent
arbitrator named,' the King of Sweden.
It was held that by reason of consan
guinity and monarchical tendencies ho
would not make a safe arbitrator in case
of a dispute between the two countries.
It was the sense of the trustees that in
order to make the treaty acceptable every
emergency should be provided for by hav
ing a suitable arbitrator appointed. They
await further information on the subject
before taking action. -'"".fM';*"-

.Steadily Taking on a New
Growth.
:
Salinas May Take Some of the Elec
trical Powerâ Dr. Heintz'i Account
of What Is Being Done.
i Dr. J. P. Heintz, an .early resident of
Monterey, is at the Occidental. He says
easiness is livening up there, and that sev
eral enterprises are on foot which will
greatly benefit the place.
The doctor is himself putting up a large
business block. It is of brick and will be
three stories high. Other improvement

are under way. The growth is solid and
substantial.
It is expected the railroad to Fresno
will be completed before lone, as some
new men are connected with the enter
prise. Many people believe the road will
not only be a great thing for the owners,
but for Monterey and other towns, and for
the people along the line. ; '
-"But the latest enterprise at Monterey,"
said the doctor, "is one connected directly
with the bringing of electrical power from
the Little Sur River, twenty-two miles
away, to' Monterey. There is a fall in the
Little Sur equivalent to -the power of 1200
horse?. :,.'/'-â¢â¢â â  -:.?-'".; ; ':K :â¢. .''.-'â â  *,<
"It is proposed to brinsr half this power
to Monterey, and for this purpose a strong
company,- composed of leading capitalists,
has : been incorporated. They will begin
work March 1. and will have the power in
Monterey by July. 't^9_^pf^__3Â®^_iÃs
""This power will be of great importance
to Monterey, as it > will greatly lesson the
cost of power a3 hitherto used; for local
purposes.; As r, an instance of the way, the
project is being received it may be men
tioned that Salinas, twenty miles distant
from Monterey, has offered the company
$10,000 a year for power equivalent to 200
horses delivered in Salinas. . - -i?Sfflw^_ _^j|
. "The electrical power will j help Monte

Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF ELECTRIC; BELTS ON THE MAR-
.."A ket. Some of them generate a current that can be noticed when
placed on the body, but many of them do not. Some that are sold un-
der i sounding names have no more electric power than a piece, of
string around the waist. These are the kind which are sold at $ i and
$2. ;. Others that do generate a sensible current are so made that it is
impossible to control the current, which burns and blisters so that no
one can wear them. Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is .different from all
these. Its battery is scientifically â  constructed ,\ perfectly insulated ; and
as the current enters the Â«; body] in a steady ,- warm ing - stream, it is made
mild or strong at will by a regulating thumb-screw, which places -.the
power of I the Belt under complete direction ]> of the wearer. â¢â  No other
electric appliance made for body wear has > this advantage, which is
partly the reason for the great popularity of Dr. Sanden's Electric
Belt; i: This, however, is coupled. with a;â  powerful', current, which is
guaranteed to last for, one year, and a new belt js given when one wears
out within that time. other electric belt^ in the country will last one
year. It is well made and applied under the personal direction of Dr.
Sanden, . a physician of 30 years' ; experience. . â¢ /" '..'.',
The value of Electricity as a cure for nervous and chronic com-
plaints, weakness, 'debility, lame back, rheumatism, etc., is conceded
by the â  medical profession â  hence Dr. '^Electric Belt is the cheap-*
est aud, est: cure known for : .' these complaints.; ' y . Read Dr. Sanden's

Supposed to Be the

The Vessel Was First Sighted Twenty.
Six Miles Oat at San*
down.
The appearance of an unknown bark
outside the beads last evening aroused the
suspicion that she might be the Swanhilda
with the accused Australian murderer,
Frank Butler, alias Harwood, on board,
and quickly there was a gathering of po
lice, detectives, reporters and a general
crowd at Meiggs Wharf, from which point
the officers arranged to start to intercept
Butler. ..')'â 
Within an hour after the mysterious
vessel was sighted among those on the
dock were Sergeant Bunner, Officer Fer
guson, Detective Silvey, â  the Australian
detectives McHattie and Conroy, two
other detectives from Captain Lees' staff
and about 200 men and women drawn
there by the maenet oi curiosity.
Up t0 9:30 o'clock two tugs had spoken
the vessel, but she refused to talk. She
continued to ; scud about, ignoring tha
tugs altogether, and the tugs continued to
hover around her. The fact that she re
fused to talk immediately aroused the sus
picions of the officers, and the night
glasses were kept turned on her with
greater steadiness.
... The vessel's name could not be made,
out in the thickness of the night, and the
situation was just the one most lavorabie
to the escape of the accused archfiend of
the Antipodes if the ship were the Swan
hilda and Butler were aboard.
In the meantime the expectant crowd:
on the dock stood and shivered. They
strained their eyes through the blackness
looking for the long dare of light that all.
pilots have been instructed to burn on
the starboard quarter in case they pick
up the Swanhilda, but they saw none, and
gradually the watchers grew fewer until
only the police, the boatmen and the re
porters were left to keep the vigil.
The bark lay off and on outside the bar
all night and will come in early this morn
ing. â  ';â â¢ ________________

Heavy Snowfall in lowa.
DES MOINES, lowa, Jan. 13.â Eight
inches of snow has fallen here since noon
to-day,and the weather indications are that
the storm is not nearly done. Street rail
way traffic has been seriously interfered
with, and the transit lines have been kept
in operation only on irregular schedule,
and with difficulty. The snow Has been
accompanied by a heavy west wind and
has drifted badly. The railroads report
no serious trouble thus far, but if the fall
lasts a few hours longer, they -will, suffer
delays of trains. The fall is now th.
heaviest of the winter.

start.
The Venezuelans have imprisoned a
foreign opera singer because she refused
to respond to an encore, and now Uncle
Sam may have to interfere again and deÂ»
termine what bounds shall be set to that
country and its people.
One. good result of the defeat of the
funding bill is the fact that Congress has
now time to turn its attention to the
Nicaragua canal, and public sentiment
should show itself strongly in favor of
speedy action on that subject also.

mate destiny of the United States is "to
be filled with benches and have a grand
stand for orators in the center thereof."
It is probable, however, that the prophecy
was meant merely to please the Texans.
Whether the President has the exclusive
right to recognize foreign countries may
be a great constitutional question for the

In commenting on the conclusion of the
Senatorial contest the Sacramento corre
spondent of the Post says as an illustra
tion of public sentiment at tbe capital:
"Mr. Shortridge lost no prestige by the
fight he put up, as it. is recognized by all
that he ac'ed like the courteous, genial,
broad-minded, gentleman that he is. He
carried on a clean campaign, in which he
avoided personalities, and put himself in
line for the indorsement of his ; party

the people with the selection of a Senator

JOHNSON AND MAG OIK-.'
The people of California will find no
satisfaction on either side of the contro
versy on the floor of the House of Repre
sentatives between Congressman Johnson
and Congr ssman Maguire, , The episode,
which is regarded as disgraceful to the
House, was in some respects disgraceful
to the State. It resulted in no good to
either party and can have no other effect
in the East than that of confirming the
judgment of those who in their ignorance
regard California as still in the wild and
woolly stage of intellectual development.
When the two Congressmen declared on
the floor of the House with theatrical de
clamation their bravery and their inten
tion to meet one another elsewhere they
simnly made themselves ridiculous in the
minds of intelligent men. The age of
dueling is over. It is well known that
loud talk on the floor of the House about
meeting elsewhere is meaningless bravado.
No courage is required for such declara
tions. All who make them are perfectly
safe on the ' floor of the House of Repre
sentatives, and the veriest coward might
there declaim as bravely as Achillea him
self. As for the meetings elsewhere they
are out of date. The man who would now
fight a duel would render himself either
liable to the law or else make himself as
ridiculous on the field of honor as he was
on the floor of Congress.
On the main issue the sympathy of
the use showed itself to be unmis
takably on the side of Mr. Johnson,
and justifiably so. If there is any
thing which is characteristic of the
American people it is that- broad and
tenerous nature which willingly gives to a
man the privilege to redeem himself from
any folly or even crime into which he may
fall.
There is very little among the American
people of that tendency to kick a man
when he is down which is common anion-.*
some races. We are a broader, nobler
and juster people. We believe in the
words of the dramatist : "There is a fu
ture for every man who has the virtue to
repent and the energy to atone." Not
infrequently in our story have men who
went wrong in their youth proven in man
hood that they had this virtue and energy
of which the dramatist speaks, and it is to
the credit of our people that when the
atonement has been made they have been
willing to accept it in good faith and to
accord no little honor to the hero who has
risen above his past to a working manhood
and marked out for himself an honorable
future.
It is the old story of the Prodigal Son,
so often repeated in human history. The
sympathy of the world is with the re
pentant son and with the generous father
who forgives. The American people have
never respected those who care to drag
up the records of the past to torture those
who have repented and atoned. Human
virtue should be equal to human error,
and whenever a man has sinned and has
shown that he has within him a virtue
capable of atoning for the sin it is noth
ing more than justice that his virtue
should receive the recognition which it
deserves.
It is to be hoped that the whole episode
will soon pass away from the memory of
men and be forgotten. No Californian,
at any rate, will have any desire to per
petuate it. It is one of those outbreaks
which occur in the heat of impassioned
debate, and it is more than probable that
both men regret it to-day more sincerely
than any one else. California will not
hold Congressman Johnson responsible
for sins for which he has atoned, nor
will it hold Congressman Maguife in dis
repute because in the heat of passion he
has been betrayed .into the false position
of attempting to dishonor a man because
of long-atoned-for deeds. We call atten
tion to the quarrel simply to emphasize
the moral of it and to point out to both
parties the folly of their course lest other
Representatives might be tempted to com
mit the same mistakes.
fOOLISH SPEECHES.
The sincere friends of the Cuban patri
ots have little reason for gratification in
the speeches made by Senators in support
of the cause of Cuban independence. Al
most without exception these speeches
have been foolish and not infrequently
they have teen of a character to injure
the cause of Cuba rather than to help it.
The recent speech of Senator Mills is a
striking illustration of the injury that
may be done to any cause by the folly of
its Inconsiderate friends. Acting upon a
report that Signor Crispi had declared
that Italy would regard American recogni
tion of Cuban independence as a serious
complication of foreign affairs the Senator
made an address in which he reviled the
Italians in a way which was not only un
dignified as a Senator and insulting to the
Italian people, but positively harmful to
the CtiDans themselves.
â¢ The Senator is reported to have said:
Who is Signor Crispi? There was a day
when the Roman ' name was ' acknowledged
throughout the whole earth, but that day has
passed, and the symbol of power of Italy to
day is a monkey and an organ-grinder. Now,
If Signor Cris*'i takes effense at the action of
Congressâ i), in conjunction with Spain, he is
disposed to -make , a holy alliance, let them
come with their monkeys and organ-grinders
and their hot tamales. Tins Government is
too great to sit under a threat of all the armed
powers of the earth.
*' A statement of that kind hurts the re
pute of the United States Senate more than
it does the Italian people. It is known to
every student of current events that
rarely if ever in history has Italian ge
nius shown more brilliantly in all depart
ments of human endeavor than during
the present generation. Without count
ing the names of such statesmen and war
riors as Cavour and Garibaldi, and Victor
Emmanuel, the kingliest king of his
time, there are in the departments of
science such men as Galvini, the discov
erer of galvanism; Volta, the inventor of
the voltaic pile, and Schiaparelli, the as
tronomer, with many another scientist
hardly less noted, to attest what Italy has
done for the advancement of human
knowledge and the improvement of hu
man conditions.
'In literature, as well as in music and
the drama, the names of illustrious Ital
ians are so many that it would be invidi
ous to select a few out of the number for
special mention. : There is, ' in fact, no di
rection in which the human intellect is
now exerting itself in wbich the Italians
have not taken a leading place, and. the
world owes as much of its advancement
to : that people, in proportion to ; their
number, as to any other on the earth. ...
. The cause of Cuba cannot be promoted
by such speeches. The people of the
United States sympathize with the Cuban
patriots, desire to see the independence of
the island established, and are glad to
know that there many members of the
United States Senate who are ready to
give recognition to the 'island. They are
not pleased, however, to see these friends
of Cuba so inconsiderate as to make
speeches unworthy of American states
manship..
It is the misfortune of Cuba that so
many men of emotional temperament
and inconsiderate speech have espoused
her cause.' She baa suffered " more than
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 14, 1897;
she has gained by their advocacy. Fortu
nately for the Cuban patriots the â¢ people
of the United States do) not form tbeir
judgment solely upon speeches made in
the Senate,, for otherwise the cause of
Cuba would be regarded as of hardly
much more importance than the cause of
Coxey.
COEPOKATION BLACKLISTS.
One of the bills now before Congress
which is likely to give rise to no little dis
cussion is that ol Congressman Lorimer
of Illinois, which defines the act of black
listing men who have'taken part in strikes
as "a conspiracy a ainst the United
States." The object of the bill is to pre
vent large corporations, and particularly
railroad companies, from : putting the
names of strikers upon their blacklists and
thus largely, depriving them of the chance
to earn a living.
According to reports which have come
to' us tne bill excludes from its benefits all
strikers who have engaged in lawless acts
in connection with a strike, lockout or
other conflict between labor and capital;
but it affirms the r right -of every wage
earner to leave his work whenever ho
pleases, and to leave it either by and of
himself or in company with a multitude
of others.
There can be no question of the essen
tial justice of such a measure. A strike is
no doubt frequently an act of folly, which
results in damage to the community at
large, but that is. no reason why, the
striker should thereafter find himself de
barred by corporate influence from obtain
ing work. A combination of large em
ployers to keep industrious men out of
work by way of vindictive punishment is
as prejudicial to public welfare as any
thing: that. could be well imagined. The
men who are thus shut out from all ave
nues of employment at the trades in which
they are skil.ed are forced to join the
already too rapidly increasing army of tbe
unemployed, and add materially to the
mass of discontented men. In their dis
content, moreover, there is a sense of in
justice which will add to its aggressive
ness and tend to make it a menace to the
general peace and public welfare.
A folly is not a crime, and it should not
be punished as such. Whenever a striker
engages m a criminal act there are laws
sufficient to punish him, and no corpora
tion should presume to take the punish
ment into its own hands. Blacklists no
doubt serve a good purpose in some re
spects, but when they are carried to the
extent of a combination, on the part of
great employers of labor to exclude from
employment men who have simply exer
cised the right of quitting work they be
come pernicious, and it is time that the
strong hand of the law should interfere to
prevent'such an exercise of irresponsible
power, ________________
THE .NICARAGUA CANAL.
It is encouraging to learn from the
Washington dispatches of yesterday that
the House committee on Rules has under
consideration the Nicaragua canal bill and
may arrange to give it an early hearing.
The subject- is one in which the whole
country is interested, and. almost any bill
providing for a speedy beginning of the
great work would be generally approved.
From the tone of the discussion before
the Committee on Rules it seems the only
serious objections to the bill are based
upon doubts as to, the feasibility of the
enterprise. When Mr. Doolittle read the
measure proposed by the committee he
was frequently interrupted by questions
concerning the engineering difficulties to
be encountered and the probable cost of
overcoming them. These questions he ,
answered from information gathered by
the Commerce Committee, and his ex- ,.
planations seem to have been satisfactory
to the majority of these who heard him. -.'-.
It is clear that since the Commerce Com
mittee has drawn up a measure providing
for the construction of the canal and de
sires to report it the members of tbat body
at any rate must be convinced of the prac
ticability of the scheme. The informa
tion which nas been sufficient to confirm
them in favor of the undertaking will
doubtless be equally satisfactory to other
members of the House, and there is there
fore good reason for believing that if time
can be given for consideration of the bill
at this session it will be sustained.
It is gratifying to note that Speaker
.Reed spoke favorably of the measure and
seemed inclined to advance it as rapidly
as possible. He is reported as saying he
has always been satisfied of the feasibility
of the enterprise and partial to it because
of the advantage it would be to the Pacific
Coast. This attitude of the Speaker of
the House gives encouragement to the
hope that it may be brought up for action
at an early day. Mr. Reed knows how to
keep business moving when he gets it
started, and it 13 safe to say that if any
way can be found to bring tbe bill into the
House before the end of this month '; the
Speaker, will find means of moving it along
with sufficient rapidity to be sent to the
Senate in time tor that slow-acting body
to discuss it and vote on it before the ses
sion closes.
AN IDLE DISCUSSION.
The resolutions now before the Senate
favoring the adoption of a constitutional
amendment, fixing the Presidential term
at six years and prohibiting a re-election,
have hardly caused a ripple even in that
body which is so easily rippled. The
country at large has taken but little note
of tnem. and it may be safely said they
will ( serve merely as an occasion /for
speech making and will never rise to the
importance of an issue of practical politics.
The lack of public interest in the resolu
tions is not due to any lack of interest in
the subject matter itself. It is due solely
to the popular consciousness that the
Senators are not in earnest. If the resolu
tions were before the House the people
would be wide awake at once, and there
would be a rapid alignment on one side
or the other of the question, for ? they
would then expect something to be done
and the (whole subject of Presidential
terms would at once become a topic of
popular discussion. ' "
.-;.â¢ The constitutional change involved in
the proposed amendment has been under
discussion in one way, or another for a
long time. It was favored by many
statesmen even before the war, and when
the Southern leaders framed the consti
tution (of the ; Confederacy they embodied
it in that instrument. â It comes up regu
larly after each T Presidential, election and
may at some time be taken up in earnest
and adopted. ( , ,
The people are in no humor for it just
now, however. ! Four years was enough of
Grover, ; and in the light of experience
with' them few 'citizens feel like taking a
risk of having six years of a similar man.
In giving time for -long speeches on the
issue the Senate is, therefore, 'simply put
ting itself on the level of a debating so
ciety, out of whose : talk no action is ex
pected to come. .â :â¢' -
- Senator Palmer of Illinois 'says: - "There
port that I voted for;. McKinley Is: not true. I
not only did not vote '; for, McKinley,' bat I did
not vote for Bryan. Moreover, not feeling like
voting for myself, is refrained from voting for
any Presidential elector:*," ~^' â ;-â¢'?â  -Â s . â 
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
" A concert trip to Honolulu is being under
taken by some San Francisco society ' singers,
in conjunction : with" Mrs. Breitschuck Mar
quardt, " the ; well-known i harpist. .' The ; party
will sail for the islands by the Coptic on Satur
day,' and alter staying eighteen days in Hono

new opera-house, will probably steam into San

accompany her son, who is said to have a high
and carefully trained barytone voice. He has
not yet ; been . heard in â  concert, but he . will
moke his debut in Honolulu, where the com
pany will -bo joined by Oscar Herold and
probably by Mme." Anise Montague Turner, an
accomplished vocalist, who has made her home
in Honolulu. Donald de V. Graham and H. M.
Gillig are social favorites in island society and
MRS. BREITSCHUCK-MARQUARDT, Who Will Go With the
Society Singers to Honolulu.
their friends will no doubt rally round them.
Mrs. Marquardt is well known artistically, as
she and her husband gave several concerts
there to crowded houses on their recent Aus
tralian tour. John ' Marquardt would have
been of the party, but his Emporium concerts,
as well as his classes in the University of the
Pacific, make it 'impossible for him to leave
home. Frank L. Unger, who sailed for Hono
lulu on the Bth inst., will make the business
arrangements for the concert.
The whole Gerardl scandal in Vienna has
now come out and it appears that the cele
brated interpreter of Strauss' operas was never
for a moment mad. The singer's immense
popularity had. given rise to jealousies, and a
conspiracy was formed against him by some of
â hit*.- rivals. Gerardi's own physician entered
into a plot made to railroad him to a lunatic
asylum, and a professor of the University of
Vienna, who bad. never even seen the unfor
tunate artist, did not hesitate to certify that
he was attacked by a mental disease brought
on by indulgence in cocaine. Happily Ger
ard! escaped from his home and sought refuge
at the house of his j lawyer, who is also his in
timate friend, in time to avoid being actually
taken to the asylum. ( Owing to the lawyer's
efforts an official Inquiry has been instituted
and three doctors appointed by the Govern
ment talked for several hours, with Gerardi
and declared that though he was in a state of
nervous excitement there was absolutely
nothing to warrant his being committed to an
asylum. No symptoms of the habitual us*e of
cocaine could be discovered and Gerardi was
his former self as far as wit was concerned, for
he several times 'convulsed the examining
physicians with laughter at the pungency of
his remarks. The; artist's own (wife, who has
made his life unhappy for some time past, is
supposed to be at the root of the trouble. The
Prefect of Police has taken measures, so say
the Viennese papers, for quelling further con
spiracies against Gerardi, but the guilty parties
have not , Deen punished and the Viennese
public is asking what satisfaction the singer
is to have from the two doctors who all but
sequestered him in a (madhouse, whence
in Vienna, as in a good : many other places,' it
is very difficult to get out, more particularly if
one is sane. *
In the East a number of newspapers are
fighting with tooth and nail the preference for
foreign artists, which soems to prevail at the
Metropolitan Opera-house. Of course, it is
very laudable to encourage home talent, but
by abusing the management the right result
is scarcely likely- to be achieved. In the first
place . it ! advertises the 'Da Reszkes, who are
already too much advertised, and In the (sec
ond place the public is quite as much, If not
more, to blame than tho management. Ameri
can artists have been tried by the Metropolitan
management,; and, with "the", exception of
Nordica : and Eames, they have been scorned
, by the public. Sibyl Sanderson was a frost,
Zelie de Lussln. was Utile better, and last
season the public I showed no interest in
Frances SaviUe. ( The American artists are
placidly securing the - recognition (abroad
which seems to be denied to them at home. It
is ; almost impossib'e, for instance, to skim
through the musical news in French paper
without finding a few lines expressing almost
hysterical delight at the continued success in
Milan of Sibyl Sanderson, "the pensionnaire
'"of our opera," exactly as if the lady I had been
( born and bred in Paris. Marie Van Zand tis
another "singer who is getting the ("frantic
enthusiasm" aoroad which is ; denied . her at
home,' and Zelie de Lussln is so popular with
the royal family in England that she is always
known facetiously as "the Queen's own."
â¢ Ireland, which has been entirely neglected
as a field, for opera, is at last beginning to
have I its day with librettists kud composers.
"Bilan Boru" has just : left the Broadway
Theater, after a most successful run, and now
"Shamus O'Brien" is repeating in New York
the success which it has already made in Eng
land .and Ireland. ; The latter jis a romantic
opera composed by Dr.* Charles Vllliers Stan-;
ford, professor of ; music .: at Cambridge Uni
versity, England, and the libretto is by George
11. Jessup.^ When"; the work; was produced in
London ten months ago it was scarcely hoped
that Ireland, its woes and its folksongs would
inspire burning enthusiasm : in the British
breast, but "Shamus O'Brien" was one of the
hits of - tho V season, j The singers mostly had
Irish names, the two who have made the big
gest 'hits, ? both j in London -and:: New; York,
being; Dennis O'Sulllvan; the California bary
tone," formerly of \ the Carl Rosa" Grand Opera
Company," and v Joseph O'Mara, a .native* of
Limerick, who studied in Milan and afterward
made his name as tenor of the Royal English
Opera Company. It is remarkable that Irish
composers' such as Balte should have turned
toother lands for inspiration when such rich
fields awaited them at home in their own folk
songs. Flotow, a German composer, made the
success/of his opera "Martha" by engrafting
into it one Irish song, "The Last Rose of Sum
mer," and yet the rich field continued to lie
fallow ; till t Villiars j Stanford ; ; wrote '.'Shamus
O'Brien." ?,'â . While not actually engrafting Irish
folksongs into his work, tne Cambridge doc
tor is said lo have given his opera the true
spirit cf the" beautiful Irish folksongs. /,',
' . The "â. villagers ;of , Lax burg, near Vienna,
where Is the imperial castle inhabited by the
Archduchess \ Stephanie," widow of ,'*. the .' un
fortunate Rudolph, were "surprised recently
to hear the Archduchess singing the solos at
high mass in the village church. , She gave
several numbers,' particularly an "Agnus Dei,,.
in a beautiful and powerful contralto voice,
which astonished a" reporter of a Vienna news
paper whom good fortune had conducted to
church at Laxenburg that ; Sunday morning. â 
It has been known for some time^ that the
Archduchess has â¢ been seriously study ing the
art of song with a leading professor, although
the tragic death of her husband caused her to
give up singing for a time. It is ueedless to
say that the priest for Laxenburg I offered no
opposition to : Stephanie appearing in his
choir, despite the Papal bull, recently revived
at the Vatican, which excludes women from
the choirs of all Catnolic churches. Rossini,
in his time, addressed more: than one letter to
Pope Pius IX on the subject, and a very curi
ous letter of his ; has just been published in
Germany , in which he begs Meyerbeer to use
all the influence he could muster toward in-
ducing Pius IX to rescind the bull, but Meyer
beer was not able to achieve anything.
They are working night and day at the Paris
Opera to put on the stage the Zola-Bruneau
opera â¢'Measidor" with all the realism de
manded by ' the librettist. Zola has insisted
that the windmills shall be real windmills,
turned by real wind, and that the machinery
in the', factories shall be as genuine as that
used in actual factories. The one point on
which he has compromised with the manage
ment is in the blue blouses worn by the work
men. It would be contrary to aIT operatic
precedent to push the passion of realism to
the extent of dressing the chorus in the un
beautiful blouses, and the sabots worn by
French workmen In every-day life, least at
that was what the management said, but Zola
contended that' he would not submit to his
workmen being arrayed in the fantastic style
of dress affected by grand opera choruses. * A
compromise has been effected by arraying the
chorus in the ; picturesque costume worn in
the Basque districts, bordering on the French
side of the Pyrenees. , (. â' (( t **v

Theatrical glory is short lived and sometimes
even contemporaries have very brief memo
ries for amusement-makers. At the death of
Sir Augustus Harris, who did so much for the
development of opera in England, there was a
grand; popular movement to v erect â a â¢ monu
i ment to the memory of ; the celebrated mana
ger. The committee having resolved on the
construction of a commemorative public foun
tain addressed itself to the London City Coun
cil for a site near Trafalgar square. - The re
quest was met by a point-blank refusal, and
no consolation site was offered, even in the
most remote district of the -big" ; metropolis.
Several municipal orators did not hesitate to
express their perfect contempt for theatrical
art in general and for all that Sir Augustus
Harris had done for it. ,

> VANDERBILT IN IT.
The Defeat of the Huntington Funding
Bill.
To the Editor of the San Francisco \ Ca'lâ Sir:
My public opposition to railroad dominance in
California began with the nomination of New
ton Booth for Governor many years ago in the
Santa j Barbara Press, which I founded - and
owned land edited until May, 1876. At that
time, and until recent years, Santa Barbara had
no direct business relations whatever with the
railroads of California. I have never regretted
my s early and continuous opposition to the
political methods and J traffic extortions of the
former Central Pacific and later Southern Pa
cific companies.: In 1878 I founded the Oak
land Times, and its columns bear ample testi
mony to my continued opposition to the grow
ing exactions and Influences of the Hunting
ton system. When the Constitutional Conven
tion met 'I was elected secretary as an anti- j
monopoly Republican, "beating Marcus D.
Boruck, the candidate and â¢ openly avowed
champion of the railroad and other monopoly
inteiests. During the past six years my work
as a Populist has tanen a wider range and has
been chiefly,; concerned with . National prob
lems which aim at ihe destruction of private
monopoly of money, laud and transportation.
If I seem now less jubilant over the final de
feat of ihe Huntington funding scheme than
some who have.been conspicuously prominent
in denouncing, it, the unfolding of future
wants may afford ample justification . for any
lack of >. enthusiasm. While I * regard the de
! feat of the funding bill as the emancipation of
California from the continuous oppressions of
tbe Southern Pacific Company, it seems I to me
that Â« complete;, release ;f rom, railroad traffic
extortion and 'pollticaldom'nance is not as
sured by any means. Congressman Loud in this
brief telegram tells us more than appears upon
the surface:' "I have no doubt of the defeat of
the funding bill in;- the House. -The majority
against it was, probably increased by, certain
opposing v; railroad . influences.'.' '; Just so.
Tuere is no douht of at-;; Indeed, he might
have said "the m i* joritv against it was secured
through the influence of the Vanderblltisj-R. .
tern," and told the truth, too, if I am correctly
informed as to the true situation.
a- Mr. Loud's '; dispatch ', was sent to *. the Ex
aminer on January 11, the day of the defeat.
On the first page of the same -Journal*: is a
Washington dispatch' headed "Vanucrbilts
May Buy;, the Road," and , the item says: "it
has been reported: in Washington for some
days past that the Vanderbilt interests nre
anxious 'to t net * possession sof the I roads , and
are prepared to make a, bid; that, would co?er
all tne : first-mortgage bonds and the liens of
the United States." ,- ;.;'.
i This is not the first intimation made public
that the Vanderbuts desired the defeat 'â ! the
funding. scheme. :: Observing ( readers did not
fail to note, in the face of repeated diplomatic
denials, somethings of peculiar significance
which cropped out during â¢ the ; visit * to ' this
coast some months since of Mr. Vanderbilt and
Mr." Depew. Richelieu saved nis life at a
critical moment by noting the fact that his
servant Joseph was -a trifle too obsequious.
"Methinks he bowed too low," hesaid.* There
was much journalistic courtesy at that time
over these two men, and to a thoughtful ob
server the' bow appeared to' be "too low." The*
gentlemen themselves seemed too anxious t*jÂ»
assure the public that it was merely a pleas-,
ure trip. - â¢ ---a t*rgr*Â«sM > '*^^ /
Populists are not overmuch enamored witlSi
the beauties of that coy and delusive sys
tem named, competition. Paeans were melo
diously lifted up in her praise when Tom Scott
was about to introduce her to the Pacific
Coast. Then the Atlantic ; and Pacific people
were equally entrancing, to be followed by the
Northern Pacific benefactors with .still "more
joyful strains, and yet the coy and delusive
siren has only lured a confiding people on to
their present pitiable plight. - If the defeat of
Huntington, Crocker & Co.- should result in
Government ownership and operation of the
defaulting roads, Which is hardly a possibility
then I could rejoice with the most joyful over
the defeat of the refunding scheme.

Time From Kobe.
The busiest vessel in the bay yesterday
was the United States battle-ship Oregon.
Boats were coming and going and along
side were scows delivering coal, and tho
water-boat, Sea Nymph, was pumping
into the reservoir thousands of gallons of
Spring Valley water. The battle-ship was
loaded down to her fullest capacity, and
every man on board felt correspondingly
happy as the huge fighting mass of steel
sank inch after inch into the waters of the
bay. .
The crew of the big warship are tired of
lying inactive in Mission Bay. They have
had all "the time ashore they want" and
sigh for "a life on the ocean wave."
War with all its horrors has no terrors
for them, and the news that Uncle Sam
was at war with a neighboring country
would be received as an item of supreme
interest.
Tne crew of the Oregon embraces almost
every nationality, but a more loyal set of
men never sailed under the stars and
stripes.
From Mission Bay the Oregon went to
Sausalito, and from there she will go to
San Diego. At the latter point final in
structions will be received, and then the
"pride of the American battle-ships" will
make her way slowly to Acapulco.
She is foul from having been lon*-; in
Mission Bay and cannot make quick time.
Nevertheless sbe wiil be a great help 10
Americans and civilization generally
should a war break out among the Cen
tral American republics. The present con
solidation of three of these States is
bound to lead to trouble, and at any time
the Ezeta element may crop up in San
Salvador. â¢
In any event the, Central American
republics are not living together in peace
and harmony, and Uncle Sam evidently
thinks he should lake a neighborly inter
est in tne squabble. Hence the hurried

Forthe first time in the history of the

Logan. The former was named after the
point on the Island of Oahu, on which she
went ashore, and will take her first cargo
of lumber to Honolulu, thus passing her
namesake (probably without shaking
hands') before again reaching Honolulu.
The Diamond Head was bought as a
wreck for $500, and, attar she was got off
and safely anchored inside the coral reef,
her cargo of coal was sold for $9 a ton.
The Fort Logan came in ballast from
Cape Town, and will go from here to the

Town again. Just what will be done with

milk dealers. All day yesterday he was
hurrying around town from one dealer to
another in quest of adulterated articles.
From nearly every store he took samples,
which he submitted to Chemist Wcnzel,
who is acting for the Board of Health.
The board is determined to prosecute to
the full extent of the- law all found to be
in possession of impure milk or food
offered tor sale. - '
In his rounds yesterday Mr. Dockery
gathered sixty-one samples of food and
eighty samples of milk, which he has sub
mitted to Chemist Wenzel for chemical
analysis. ''â '-* ;
Yesterday Mr. Dockery swore out a large
number of warrants for the arrest of peo
ple who he says were selling adulterated
milk and selling milk without having first
procured the necessary permits. These
will be arrested at once, and from all ap
pearances the Police Court calendars will
be clogged with impure-milk cases for
some time to come. Those to be arrested

No End to the Rush.
Â--It seems the great closing-out sale of
Arm and^Callleau, corner Geary street and
Grant avenue, has no end to its great rush.
To-day is the tenth day of the sail and the
doors still have to be kept closed and only
from time to time can buyers.' force their
way into the store. ; The sale will last only
a few days more. The $25 capes selling at
$6, $75 suits selling at $15,' $2 wrappers sell
ing at 35c, arid all other goods in propor
tion, has brought the crowd. ''.* /vi

LABOR AGENTS
FIGHT NEW LAWS
They Meet and Denounce
Commissioner Fitz
gerald's Plans.
A Committee From This City'
Will Do Battle at Sac- f
ramento.
Complaint Is Made That the Free
Bureau Lives by Coercing
State Olficers.
- . â¢ â¢ â¢ â 
Sin managers of the various employ
ment agencies and labor bureaus of the
City are up in arms against Labor, Com
missioner Fitzgerald.
< ."About twenty people who nave for years
been engaged in the business of furnish
ing employment for idle laborers for a
small fee met at the office of C. R. Hansen,
110 Geary street, last night and formulated
measures to defeat legislation formulated
by Commissioner Fitzgerald. V .*.
â¢" To a proper understanding of . the issue
between Fitzgerald and those who are
fighting him â it is necessary, to bear in
mind that the Commissioner conducts a
free labor bureau; tbat he proposes laws
giving him the power to establish like
bureaus all over the State, and that he
has emphaticallyplaced himself on record
as bsing engaged- in a war to the Knife
against all labor bureaus.
"In a letter to a prominent State official,
Fitzgerald said he intended to extermin
ate : -us," said Agent Ready last night,
."and we propose to show him up. . He has
tried 7to coerce the heads of State institu
tions to favor his bureau, has lied about
us and is simply seeking to gain political
power by wiping out all opposition."
- The agents /resolved to send to Sacra
mento 250 printed copies ;. of the I protest
against the conduct ot Commissioner Fitz
: gerald. I ; : 'Â» .' ..'.-,' '
"What we object to most vitally," said
the proprietor of th- Ewer Company, "is
that the .new bill gives the Commissioner
the power of a czar. Under "provi
sions be may dictate what our advertising
is and where we advertise. He may use
our bulletin-boards, placing thereon what
he desires and tearing off what is distaste-,
ful to him. It seems to' me that this is
about the most autocratic power ever
given to anybody in this country."
The following, are the 'provisions of tbe
new bill which are most ODnoxious to the
local agents. They are .; particularly sore
over the matter because, they say, some of
the labor unions have apparently indorsed
the bills: /
Sections. It shall be unlawful for any em
ployment agent to insert any advertisement
in any newspaper or in any other manner ad
vertise for help of ' any : kind unless the Â» said
advertising is .done In pursuance of actual
bona-fide orders tor help which shall have
been received by tne said agent. The Com
missioner of the Department of Labor may at
any time investigate said orders In order to
satisfy himself of their authenticity. ;
Sec. 7. The Commissioner of the Department
of Labor shall, during business hours, have
tree access to all offices used by any employ
ment agent, or agents, and shall be permitted
to post therein copies of any. lnws or notices
concerning the conduct of the business of the
said employment agent, or agents, or other in
formation concerning labor. The said copies
of r laws : or v notices - shall be ' : conspicuously
posted and shall not be hidden, removed or
defaced. .;'â ':;.
--: ."The last section is cunningly worded,"
said C. R. Hansen. "It gives the Com
missioner full power to post' in our offices,
for which we. pay rent, 'any information
concerning labor/; That' would give him
the right to taKe away our customers? by
Informing them that he had jobs for them.'
It is an un-American and unconstitutional
' law. We have always favored labor bu
reau af always I refused to f hire 1 scabs,* and
vet they brand us as criminals. :We ob
ject to his/law/, because; he has sworn he
would exterminate us."
'I? J. F. Crossett, who has been tn business
here many years, was of the same opinion.
; He said that the I, bills proposed*,- by I the
Commissioner leave "l absolutely.' nothing
for the . employ ment agents. "He calls
the bureau 'my' bureau in. various letters
' to the heads 0? State departments, and. is
, simply, seeking political power," said- Mr.
i Crossett. Â«. : ...-l- -I- -I.- -.|7
--"* It was 'decided to send a committee to
Sacramento forthwith to fight r. the bills,
which come; up before the committee on
' Monday * nigh t.-/4 The 'I following / sections
are particularly obnoxious ; to the agents,
who say their/ provisions rob them of all
liberty:
â¢I Section 3. livery employment agent shall, in
connection with his business, keep a book or
set of books showing the number of applica
tions lor employment made to said employ
ment agent, the number of - applicants sent by J
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
him to employer.?, the number of applicants
ior whom employment has been secured by said
employment agent, the amount of fees and
commissions and the character and value of any
other property taken by said employment
agent in return for securing employment for
applicants, and the amount oi money and the
character and' value, of other property re
turned to applicants who have failed to ob
tair employment; and. every employmert
agent shall, upon the first day of each; month,
furnish to the Commissioner oi the Bureau of
; Labor a written statement from said book or
set of books plainly setting forth said facts
upon a blank form to be furnished by the said
Commissioner. *
Sec.*4. Every firm, association, corporation
or person who pursues fur profit the business
of furnishing information to any applicant or
applicants for employment for the purpose of
enabling said applicant or applicants to ob
tain employment, or who registers for any fee,
charge or commission the name of any appli
cant or applicants for employment for the pur
pose of securing employment for said appli-
I cantor applicants, is an employment agent
within the meaning of this act.
Mr. Ready will probably be the chief
member of the committee to fight the
Labor Commissioner. He will go to Sac
ramento Sunday night. The agents will
have another meeting to-night, at which
they, will discuss various phases of the
proposed' laws and ; make plans to defeat
them. _________________
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Several Performances Ara Near the End
. of Their Runâ Next Week's
Attractions.
"The Old Homestead" is in its last days
at the Columbia Theater. On Monday
evening the first Nordica concert will take
place, when the' third act of Gounad's
"Faust" will be the piece de resistance.
Joseph Murphy is continuing his per
formances in "Kerry Gow" at the Col
umbia without showing any signs of
recent indisposition. The Murphy season
will end witn this week, and on Monday
"The Devil's Auction" will take the stage.',
Hugo Toland returned to the cast of
"Chispa" at the Alcazar last night, as he
had recovered sufficiently from his attack
of laryngitis to act, though he was still
suffering from hoarseness. George Os
borne resumed the role of Injun Jack,
with which he is so thoroughly identified.
Walter Belasco, who clayed the Indian on
Tuesday, in the shuffle of roles occasioned
by .Toland's sudden indisposition, 1 confined
himself last night to his part of the emi
grant, in the prologue./
Clever work is done in the prologue of
"Chispa" by Miss Sue Blanchard, a local
debutante, who has ; played one â¢or two
very.little Darts at the Alcazar,' but who is ;
doing her first work of any importance as
Mary Monroe. Miss Blanchard acts her
trying death scene very realistically.
"The Land of Â the Midnight Sun" is a
spectacular melodrama of the thrilling
type which always ..gives satisfaction . to
patrons of the Grand. /The caste is large,
and cm the whole a satisfactory one. John
J. Pierson, who. reappears this week, after
an absence of some years, plays his orig
inal character of Stephen Orry, and looks
very picturesque, though his acting would
be improved if he did not* appear to be so
thoroughly impressed with the conscious
ness/of his own pictnresqueness. ': Fred
Butler is good as Governor ; Jorgenson/
and Frank Hatch is giving a careful and
lifelike study of the old sea-dog, Captain
Folly weather. ,' .*'.â  "*â '-â â ''' : '[ .; ; â "; l-/'-/'' /

SCHOOL DIRECTOR
Confirmed by the Board
of Education Last
Evening.
Superintendent Babcock Named
Dr. Mary Morrison as His
First Choice.
Teachers Will Be Paid the Amount
of November Saary That Was
Withheld by the Old Board.
The Board of Education apnointed Dr.
Ragan as successor to School Director
Halstead last evening. Mr. Hal stead was
buried yesterday. % f -/A-.'
Previous to the regular session of the
board, a meeting of the committee of the
whole was held to discuss the matter, and
a number of names were presented by
Superintendent of Schools Babcock, who
has the naming of the successor of any
member who through death or other rea
son retires from tne board.
- The Superintendent desired to have a
lady on the board, and he first presented
the name of Dr. Mary Morrison, who has
long been connected with the department.
: The members were not ready to accept
her into the fold and the Superintendent
presented a number of other names which
were likewise unsatisfactory. Finally it
was intimated to him that the name of
Dr. D. F. Ragan, who was chairman of the
last Democratic Municipal Convention,
would be satisfactory, and when the regu
lar meeting was called last evening Dr.
Ragan 's name was presented and unani
mously indorsed by the board.
Dr. Ragan will take his seat at the next
meeting. ?>';:.-:
Mrs. V. de Bretteville preferred written
charges against Miss M. M. Kenzie, prin
cipal of the Hancock School. She averred
that Miss Kenzie had been arbitrary and
unjust in suspending her son from school
and in setting a bad example in losing her
temper, by displaying discourtesy and
rudeness toward parents, and of lack
of judgment in inflicting punishment ior
offenses committed.
The matter was referred to the Super
intendent for investigation.
Sections 173 and 174 of the rules were
amended by the insertion of the follow
ing: v-
' Any repairs must be applied for by the prin
cipal by requisition, and it shall then be the
duty of the inspector of buildings to visit the
school and report to the chairman of the Com
mittee on Buildings and Grounds on such re
quisition. When the cost of such repairs is
not over $10 the chairman may, if he deems it
advisable, order the work to be done; but if
the cost of such repairs be more than $10 and
less than : $200, bids for the same Khali be
passed upon by the Committee on Buildings
and Grounds and the work awarded to the
lowest responsible bidder.
The board decided that the schoolteach
ers who were cut half a month's salary in
November last must be repaid at once,
and on motion of the Superintendent a
resolution was ] adopted aiding the short
age to the salary demands for January, so
that the full amount may be paid. A res
olution was also adopted to have the
Finance Committee apportion a sufficient
amount on July and January 1 to pay the

SUDDEN DEATH OF
GEORGE A. ABEL
Two Jets of Gas Were
Turned On in His
Room.
His Wife and Daughter Make
the Discovery in the Early- ;
Morning.
The Friends of the Well-Known Grain
Inspector Scout the liea of
Suicide. ..
George A. Abel, who for the past six
years has been chief grain inspector ot the I
San Francisco Produce Exchange, was i
found dead in his room yesterday morn- |
ing as a result of asphyxiation by gas.
Twogasjeis were turned on and the boiy i
of Mr. Abel was found lying on the floor |
immediately under the gas fixture. While \
the circumstances would indicate suicide
all those who knew the deceased refuse to
accept the theory, declaring there was no
cause in Mr. Abel's life for such a act.
Mr. Abel was 52 years of age and leaves
a widow and four children â three daugh
ters and a son. They are almost pros- 1
trated with their sudden grief. He was in
independent financial circumstances, in
receipt of a good salary, did not speculate j
and was of a uniformly pleasant and con
tented disposition.
It is known that he has not been in
good health for some time, however, being
troubled with some affection of the kid
neys, and he remarked to a friend on Mon- :
day that he had lost twenty-five pounds in
weight, within the past few months. He j
did not complain, however, and no one
supposes that this trouble would lead him
to think of taking his own life. It is !
suggested by friends who examined the ,
room yesterday that when he turned off j
the gas he inadvertently turned it on j
again. It is said, as evidence against the \
theory of suicide that the door of tbe ]
room when he was discovered was slightly j
ajar.
It is suggested that Mr. Abel awoke dur
ing the. night and perceiving the odor of I
gas arose with the intention of turning it j
off,' and was overcome either by the gas
or a spasm of pain from his kidney affec
tion, with which latter he was frequently
attacked ; that he fell and was unable to
arise.
- Mr. Abel left the Produce Exchange
about 6 o'clock Tuesday evening. Mem
bers of the exchange who saw him last \
say that he was in his usual happy frame j
of mind.
He went to his home, and telling his !
wife that he did not feel well retired to his I
room on the upper floor without taking
any dinner. Mrs. Abel and her daughter J
went calling Tuesday evening and did not i
return until quite late. Mrs. Abel looked |
into her husband's room about 11 o'clock, j
He was lying on a lounge fully dressed j
apparently dozing. The gas was burning
ana he had evidently been reading. Mrs.
Abel and her daughter retired. At 2.
o'clock in the morning Mrs. Abel awoke
and detected the smell of -gas. She
aroused her daughter Gertrude and to
gether they went to her husband's room,
whence the gas was flowing. They threw
up the windows and in the dim light dis
covered Mr. Abel's body lying stretched
upon the floor. He had retired for the
night since Mrs. Abel had looked in, for
the body was now clothed only in the
night dress. The distracted women gave
the alarm, Dr. Chalmers was called, but
he was too late.

grain inspector created a profound im
pression on , Change yesterday, for Mr.
Abel was known to and loved by every
member. The exchange adjourned at
noon out of respect, the flag was run up
at half-mast and a committee of three,
consisting of E. Ransome, F. Dalton and
W. Dresbach, was appointed to draw up
suitable resolutions.
In announcing the death to the ex
change the president, A. Ger herding, paid
a high tribute to the efficiency of the de

Mr. Abel was generally admitted to be
the best judge of wheat on the coast. At
least, his judgment was more relied upon
than that oi any other man. \ His reputa
tation among dealers was world-wide.
Buyers in England, Australia and else
where insisted upon his certificate being
attached to bills.
The deceased was a prominent member
of the Druids and of the Odd Fellows.

The above sketch represents an oil color painting just completed by the local artist Amedee Joullin which is attracting
much attention from some of the best artists here, and which will probably soon be exhibited at the Hopkins Art Institute.
The name of the picture is "Gone," and it portrays the grief of a son at the moment the spirit of the chief, bis father,
passes from the body, which has just ceased its death struggle. The chief has received a fatal bullet wound in the breast
and is lying on the floor of the mud hut peculiar to the Indians of the Southwest, while the son in an attitude of intense
despair bows his head over the corpse from which he bas just heard the last deep-driven gasp.
The picture conveys to tbe beholder a sense of the agony of the parting which the young warrior must bear all alone,
for there are no comforters near, and solitude adds to the sadness of his experience. 'â *â¢â :"â . .-â¢â¢'.
Mr. Joullin has in his studio the Indian pottery and blankets which he studied to make the details of his fine work
true to what such a scene would really be, and they are in the picture just as the real j articles look. * The picture is the
creation of his imagination, and he planned to throw upon his canvas an expression of the sudden and overwhelming pain
that would come to such a mourner over the dead. In this, it is considered, he has been successful to a high degree. '

FRUIT AND FLOWERS.
The ladles of the "Fruit and Flower
Mission Have Done a Big
Year's "Work.
The annual meeting of the San Fran
cisco Fruit and Flower Mission took
place yesterday afternoon at the society's
headquarters, 631 Sutter street.
Reports of the officers of the past year
were read and adopted, and officers chosen
for this year. : The secretary's report
showed that the charitable work for the
past year had been particularly heavy.
They had received two donations of large
amounts one of $150 and one from an
English estate of $300. The iact that 200
Thanksgiving dinners had been furnished
to those who otherwise would have been
so unfortunate as to be without good din
ners on tbat day was mentioned as a sub
ject for special rejoicing.
The treasurer's report showed that the
ladies had expended in their generous
work among the poor $600 more than the
regular income for the year. Fortunately
they had a sum of $4000 to draw upon
which had been given them in a single
donation, or otherwise they would have
been compelled to close their doors ior
lack of funds to continue the work of re
| lief. This is a condition of things which
these charitable ladies wish the . attention
of the public called to, for with an outgo
j exceeding their regular income a they will
I soon exhaust that big and generous gift of
$4000. If they could secure more life
members at i $20 they would prefer that
form of assistance, as it would render un
t necessary frequent appeals to : the public.
The results of the year showed very en
couraging progress. both in work done and
in growth in membership.- Fifteen new
active members -,-, were : added yesterday.
They have thirty workers who give their
personal "attention to; the doing of this
labor of r . love. They visit the sick, bring
flowers 'and fruits and also substantial
when needed, and above all, as one of the
ladies wished the public specially to under
stand, they s bring { good - cheer, i The girls
are exhorted : to go to tbe sick man as if
they were visiting a brother, and to make
very sure; that their charity will never be
i felt to be cold charity by the unfortunates
' to whom they come as ministering angels.

MONEY SPENT FOR
PURITY OF ELECTION
How Committees Handled
Coin for Political
/ Parties.
Details of the Modest Expenses
That Were Incurred and
l Met
Democrats, United Labor ites, Non-Par
tisans and Populists Had Money
Leftâ Republicans Â£yen.
After the heat and worry of the recent
political campaign a gentle calm has fallen
upon the contending factions that only a
short lime ago were strenuously strug
i tiling for office. Some reminders of the
j contest have been filed in the office of the
] County Clerk in the form of sworn stale-
I ments of receipts and expenditures of the
so-called purity of election committees of
the different political organizations.
These statements make interesting read
ing at this juncture.
The People's party committeemen
acknowledged the receipt of $2019 G0 and
show expenditures amounting to $2000 75.
I The schedule of receipts shows that the
j committee had a sliding scale : for the
different candidates. For instance,
I Joseph Leggett and F. H. Donne . who
| were indorsed for the office of Superior
Judge contributed $120 each, while Robert
' Ferral gave $100 and W.G. Burke, nomi-
I nee for the same office, gave $80, J. A.
Spinetti, candidate, for Police Judge,
furnished $90 for the" campaign fund, but
Walter Gallagher, his companion on . the
ticket for the same office, satisfied ' the
committee's demands with $60. The nomi
nees for Justice of the Peace were f , also
unequally taxed. Sands W. Forman be
ing let off for $20, though W. T. Hess was
| compelled to put. up $50. Supervisorial
j and Senatorial candidates were called on
for $36 and $14 40 each respectively, and no
favors were shown. Candidates for School
I Director and the Assembly ranged in their
| contributions from $5 to $10.
The statement of the Republican County
Committee is quite .interesting,' the con
tributions from various candidates differ
ing widely. The offerings are recorded as
follows: ."-*-â. *'â¢

The Citizen's Non-partisan party proved
itself to be considerable of a party, not

non-partisanship. Its receipts amounted
to $3362 52 and its expenditures t0 53195 40,
leaving a. balance of $167 12 In the hands
of the treasurer.
The favorite sum. for contribution
seemed to be $10, the greater part of the
fund being : made of donations of that
character. Candidates were gently dealt
witb, the matter being entirely voluntary
so far as their. contributions were con
cerned. All members of the committee
gave of their funds as well as their time to
help the cause. Candidates for important
i municipal offices -gave from $10 to $80 ac
cording to their inclination and ability,
and some altogether failed to respond.
The name of Frank J. Sullivan, brother
in-law of Mayor Phelan, appears three
times, as he figures in the * capacity of
"an^el" for the committee. His offerings
are noted as follows: September 30. $100;
October 14, $200; November 4, $200. Mayor â 
Phelan is credited with only $70. George
K. Fitch was a liberal contributor to the
fund. *

Twenty-third Senatorial District secured
$66 from John J. Tyrrell, all of which was
expended for advertising.

HOW TO BREAK
A VICIOUS HORSE
The Subject Threshed Out
in Judge Campbell's
% Court.
Professor 0. R. Gleason Charged
â¢ With Cruelty to
Animals.
The Judge/ After Listening to the
Evidence Pro aad Ccn, Dis
misses the Case. .
The various methods of breaking in
vicious horses were discussed in all" their
phases to an interested audience in Judge
Campbell's court yesterday afternoon, and
opinions expert and otherwise were freely
given.
The occasion was hearing of the charge
of 'cruelty to animals against Professor 0.
K. Gleason, alleged to have occurred at
the People's Palace on the night of Janu
ary 5. Gleason was anested by Secretary
Holbrook of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals at the time the
performance was given. Secretary Hol
brook conducted the prosecution and At
torney T. P. Rior Jan appeared for the de
fendant.
The main facts in regard to the way the
big bay horse in question was treated by
the professor and his assistants were not
denied by the defense, although there was
a difference . of opinion as to whether the
horse's mouth was bleeding after the per
formance.
The points at issue which the Judge in
sisted should only be taken into consider-,
ation were whether the horse was treated
with unnecessary cruelty, and whether it
was a vicious and dangerous animal. The
Judge said he Knew something about
breaKing in horses in Oregon, and he could
not be swayed by the opinions of people
.who were not experts.
The witnesses for the prosecution were
Officers W. T. Hooper and T. A; Hoi brook,
of the society, and Secretary Hoi brook,
who all testified that the horse was treated
with unnecessary cruelty, and that it was
not a vicious animal to all appearances.
They also testified that it was bleeding at
the mouth and was thoroughly exhausted
and" bathed in perspiration at the end of
forty minutes' driving in which the break
ing-in process was carried on.
* William Locke, the owner of the horse,
was also a witness for the prosecution.
He admitted that the horse was mean and
would shy at anything. He had tried to
break the horse, but it was too expensive,
as . it - kicked and broke everything it was
harnessed t0... It was not a safe . horse for
any inexperienced person to drive. Any
thing, however slight, that touched the
horse on the hind legs' made it kick out
viciously, .v , fi. ;-*Â»"
Dr. W. F. Egan, Dr. Thrasher, Colonel
Taylor, the ex-Supervisor, and W. W.
Montague all testified that they were
present on the night in question and saw
no unnecessary cruelty in t the . perform
ance, and Dr. Thrasher if aid -he saw no
blood in the horse's mouth; â > Colonel Tay
lor and W. W. Montague are members of ]
the Society for Prevention to Animals, i
and the colonel said be had told Holhrook |
when he made the arrest that he had
committed a mistake. The colonel testi
fied he had broken all kinds of vicious
horses on his ranch for the past twenty
five years.
. The defendant also testified in his own
! behalf, denying that there was any unnec
essary cruelty in his method ot breaking
in horses. ;
The prosecution and defense had other
witnesses to testify, buttbe Judge thought
he had beard enough evidence. He said
he always made it his duty to back up the
efforts of the society, but after . listening
to all the facts and the testimony of the
owner of the horse and such experienced
men as Colonel Taylor and W. W. Monta
gue he did ; not think any unnecessary
cruelty had \ been proven - and he would
dismiss the case. There was applause
from some of the audience, was in
stantly suppressed. â¢; ;
THE COOPER PROPERTY.
It Will Be Disposed .Of According to
.: the Will of Harriet. '*
The will of tho late Harriet Cooper,
daughter of the late Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper,
has; been filed for probate. It bequeaths
$2500 to the Normal; Training School of â 
the Golden Gate 'Kindergarten Associ
ation, Anna M. Stovall to have the same
in charge. The residue of the estate is
devised to the aunts of the testator, two
thirds to Mrs. R. M. Rawllngs and a
third to * Mrs. J. A. Skilton. -They are to
attend to the education of Ingersoll Jones
of Jasper, Term. :
* The circumstances attending the death
of Mrs. Cooper and her daughter are said
to create the legal .presumption .that the ,
former died first, both being * found
asphyxiated with; gas in the same bed.
The daughter being younger and stronger
would naturally : survive. :, The '; mother's
will . was found to be invalid Decause of a
defect, and Harriet: would therefore suc
ceed to the estate. ;As Harriet's will is in
legal *. form i the property, loft by tho Coop
ers will be disposed of in accordance with
the provisions of the daughter's will. The
bequests of Mrs. Cooper to her personal
friends will undoubtedly be carried out by
her relatives -in accordance with her ex- !
pressed desires. . ... ,v

When this is taken into consideration,
and at the some time we find hosts of
people still willing to be led astray by the
hundred and one nostrums which irre-
sponsible traders try to foist upon them
on the pretext that these preparations are
"as good as * Paine's celery compound"
[but really because 'â  they make a big profit
on such preparations], it is time for every
one who detests fraud to warn his neigh-
bors and take the warning to himself, that
when he goes to get a bottle of Paine's
celery compound he must not. be wheedled
into taking some other remedy.
;; Paine'acelery compound makes people
well. These ot er things work harm.
: Paine's celery compound is not a patent
medicine, v Its formula is given , freely to
every physician.
These trashy stuffs that you are asked
to buy are made up of ingredients that
should -never be taken into a sick stomach.
; These ordinary nervines, tonics and sar-
saparillas are no more to be compared
with Paine's celery compound than a glim-
mering candle is to be compared with the
wonderful modern searchlight.
If a person needs a true nerve tonic, a
real blood purifier, a reliable diuretic, that
will restore strength, renew vitality, reg-
ulate the kidneys, liver and bowels, and
make one well, let that person try his or
her first bottle of Paine's celery com-
pound and mark the wonderful result!

HOLDING COURT
AT THE HOSPITAL
Judge Low Takes the
Evidence of William
F. Healey.
He Was Shot by His Brother
ly in- Law and Is Supposed
to Be Dying,
Proves a Very Unwilling Witness
and Admits He Does Njt Want
to Prosecute the Case.
judge Low held court yesterday at the
City and County Hospital, which was
rendered necessary by the fact that Wil
liam F. Healey was reported to be in a dy
ing condition.
On the night of January 1 Healey was
snot at Twenty-sixth and Folgoin streets,
and bis brother-in-law, Albert F. Davis,
i a barber, was arrested and charged^ with
assault to murder. He was released on
$2000 bonds, but on Monday when Judge
Low was notified by the doctors at the
City and County Hospital that Healey
was in a critical condition, blood-poison
ing having set in, the Judge issued a
bench-warrant for Davis' arrest, and fixed
his bonds at $."3000. â¢ â¢ .
The Judge decided to take Healey's evi
dence yesterday morning at the bospital.
-Prosecuting Attorney Reynolds and the
court stenographer were present, besides
, Lieutenant W. F. Burke of the Seven
â¢_ teenth-street station, and the prisoner
1 and his attorney, John J. Guilfoyle Jr. â :â

hopelessly. These are Mrs. John Petreau
of 916 York street, Mrs. John Pettee and
Sister Julia.l^9fe
Between 3 and 4 o'clock last Friday
afternoon, Mrs. Bueter entered the offices
of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, on Market street, ac
companied by her little girl, Ida, aged 3,
and her little boy, Willie, aged 2 years.
She applied for aid to Secretary Welch of
the society, and had some conversation
with him. Before the interview was con
cluded, Mrs. Bueter in some way learned
that there was a strong probability that
her children would be taken from her by
the society, and at once became greatly
excited. She cried, beseeched that she
and her little ones might not be parted,
and even threatened to kill them and her
self rather than to submit to such separa
tion.
What conversation took place between
Secretary Welch and herself is not learned,
but there is no doubt about what happened
to Mrs. Bueter. She was taken out to
the City Prison, where she was booked, as
it appears on the police records, at 5:30
p. m. The charge made against her is
cruelty to children, the complainants
being C. P. Welch, the secretary of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children, and Officer Callinan. Her chil
dren went with her to the City Prison and
there they were taken from her. From
that time to the present she has not seen
them. Tuesday morning she was sent to
the asylum at Agnews, cherishing the
delusion tbat the children had been
burned, and begging Mrs. Kane, the
matron of the Receiving Hospital, to see
that they were buried.
From 5:30 p.m. on Friday until 9:20
Saturday night Mrs. Bueter occupied a
cell in the prison. Sister Julia, who had
learned of the case, with Mrs. John Pettee
visited the prison, and upon a statement
of the facts Mrs. Bueter was transferred
"Upon what grounds?" asked the Judge.
"Because it might criminate myself,"
said Healey.
The Judee asked bim if any one bad
been talking to him about the case, and he
replied in the negative.
Reynolds tried him again, but in an
swer to the question as to who shot him
hesaid he aid not know. He admitted
that Davis was with him at the time and
another man, and finally said that Davis
had said, "1 shot yon," but he did not
know himself who did it.
"You don't want to prosecute this
man?" said the Judge, pointing to Davis.
"No, I don't," replied Healey. â  â¢
.Nothing further could be got out of
him, und he was asked to sign the recog
nizance, but he positively refused to do so.
The Judge thereupon declared court ad
journed. ' ' -
CLUBBING A STEWARD.
Warrant Out for the Arrest of Harry
Hansen. Keeper of a Sailors'
Boarding-House.
Carl Smith, steward of the ship Oth
m&rschen, lying at Fourth-street wharf,
swore to a complaint in Judge Joachim-
Fen's court yesterday, charging Harry
Hansen, keeper of a sailors' boarding
bouse at 17 Vallejo street, with battery.
Smith hat been boarding at Hansen's
anplace.d Hansen got him the position of
steward ot the Othmarschen about two
weeks ago. Smith bad never been on a
German. vessel before and he decided not
to continue longer as steward of the Oth
mnrschen.iaffP_^JMp^flfK|g^^
Yesterday morning, Smith said. Hansen
and his runner went on board the vessel
and Hansen insi-del upon Smith remain
ing as steward. He demanded $10 from
Smith for procuring him the po3i*ion. but
Smith refused and offered him $7. Then
Hansen knocked Smith down with a club
and kicked him on the face.
Smith was taken to the Receiving
Hospital and had a. wound on his scalp
and another on his left cheek stitched and
dressed. .

to the Receiving Hospital. There she re
mained until she was taken away to Ag
news. While there she was visited by
Mrs. John Petreau â¢ and her sister, two
ladies who knew her well, and who during
many months had befriended her; also
by Mrs. John Pettee and Sister Julia. She
begged them all to bring her children >to
her, but one cause and another prevented.
She went away firmly believing that since
tbey had been taken from ber tbey had
died. The weight of that grief is upon
her as she raves and calls lor them, at
Agnews.
Very likely this may prove to be a cause
celebre, because it forcibly present* to
view the great powers which are reposed
in an officer not elected by the State, who
is able to judge and to execute his indi
vidual judgment singly and alone, with
out sworn testimony or judicial hearing,
whether mothers shall be separated from
children of very tender years, and young
children from mothers. The disastrous
result of this case will be long remem
bered as an example of what might hap
pen many times.
Careful investigation into all the facts
leads to the discovery that only two causes
are assigned by any one who came in con
tact with Mrs. Bueter for her sudden vio
lent insanity. Secretary Welch of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children expresses the belief that Mrs.
Bueter's insanity was occasioned by the
fact that she had been definitely and
finally refused aid by the Associated
Charities of the City, and that when be
declined to give her any aid. which was
what she sought, she thought that she
was "at the cud of her rope," as he ex
presses it, and so became frantic.
Secretary Welch was interviewed yes
terday, and the story he told concerning
Mrs. Bueter is given ' herewith: "She
came in here with her children and asked
for help. I telephoned to Mrs. Flint at
the Associated Charities, and from her
learned that sbe bad refused to approve
of an order which the Chronicle had given
her and which had to be approved by
Mrs. Flint to enable her to get the order
filled. I do not know ho. v she got the
idea that her children might be taken
away; but when she heard me speak of
Mrs." Flint's name she at once began to
scream out not to take her children
away.
"She prayed and screamed and ran to a
window as if to throw herself out, but 1
was not afraid that she would do tbat. I
knew that she would not, in fact. As to
the complaint, I do not know who first
made it, but Mrs. John Pettee, who is now
talking about this matter, made a com
plaint. No, Ido not know that the com
plaint was for cruelty to children, for the
complaint has not been written out in tbe
book."
Secretary Welch showed the book with
the entry referred to, but there was no
complaint set forth in that connection.

"But what did the cruelty to children
con-ust of?" was asked. .
â - "Why," answered the secretary, "that
consisted in dragging these little children
around with her to the charitable so
cieties." .
The books at the offices of the Asso
ciated Charities Âo n ..Commercial /street
demonstrates very clearly that Secretary
Welch was mistaken when ; he ; asserted
that Mrs Flint had declined to recom
mend to the Chronicle -.Bureau that aid
should "â  be given to Mrs. Bueter.'- As a
matter ?of fact Mrs-. Bueter ;â â¢ received an
order from the Associated Charities on the
Chronicle Thursday for provisions, the
day before she appeared at the office of
the Society for the Pievention of Cruelty
to Children. Therefore, he is probably
mistaKen in. believing that Mrs. Bueter, at
the time she had j her interview with him,
thought that the Associated Charities bad
decided not to help her any more. It
was denied positively at the Associated
Charities that any suggestion for the sep
aration of Mrs. Bueter from her children
had originated there. , '**
' Mrs. Kane, matron of the City Receiving
Hospital, said yesterday that after Mrs.
Baeter was removed from a City Prison
cell to tie hospital, she was certainly in
sane. While Mrs. Bueter was in the
Receiving Hospital two ladies called to
' see her, besides Mrs. Pettee "and Sister
Julia, and said that they had known Mrs.
Bueter lor one year, and they would not
believe that she could be insane. They
said that she had always been very quiet.
The ladies were probabiy Mrs. Petreau
and her sister. They expressed the opinion
that separation from her children had
driven Mrs. Bueter to insanity. Mrs.
Petreau made the same statement to
Sister Julia yesterday.
Mrs. John Pettee, speaking of the case
Monday night, said that she considered
the arrest of Mrs. Bueter outrageous on
such a charge as cruelty to children, be
cause she bad previously met Mrs. Bueter
and had found her to be kind to her chil
dren. She had helped Mrs. Bueter out of
her own pocket and had visited her in
prison. These facts probably indicate
that Secretary Welch is mistaken in think
ing that Mrs. Pettee has made charges
against Mrs. Bueter.
Mrs. Bueler's two children were yester
day given into the guardianship of Sister
Julia and yesterday afternoon they were
found at the Sheltering Arms on Harri
son street, where they will make their
home for the present. The older child,
little Ida, spoke several times of her
mother. The younger can speak very
little. They are plump, well fed and
healthy children, fully Â»qual in these re

Will Continue. the Recount in the Con
test for the-Auditorahlp.
The votes of fifteen precincts in the
Thirty xth Assembly District were re
counted yesterday in the contest for Aud
itorship between William A. Deane and _
William Broderick. Only a few minor
error-* were noted, a majority of them be
ing due to difference of opinion in regard
to the counting of ballots or to clerical
mistakes.
The result of yesterday's recount was as
follows:
Precinct 6 â Broderick lost 1, Deane
gained 1; 7â change; Bâ No change; 9â
Deane gained 1: 10â change; 11âBroier

Broderick gained 1; Deane gained 1: 17â
change; 18â No change; 19â Broderick gained
4, DcÂ»ane gained I*, 20â No change.
Up to tiie present Mr. Broderick has
gained nine votes by the recount. V
There was a rumor that Mr. Deane in
tended to abandon the contest, but both
he and his attorney, W. H. Schooler, de
nied that there is at present any such in
tention, so \ the case will go on as usual

From a statement dropped by a mem

men of California and San Francisco need
not be-uneasy concerning the bicycle bag
gage bill to be introduced in the Legisla

those States. The railroad company has
entirely ; changed front in regard to the
matter, since it rescinded an order collect

not co fight the bill in the Legislature.
The company may go even further and
provide special accommodations in bag
gage-cars for bicycles.
Subsequent to the rescinding of the or
der which raised so much commotion last
fall among wheelmen the railroad com
pany has practically been carrying bicy
cles free within â  the State. An order was
issued to carry them free within a radius
of fifty miles of substantially all principal
points. ;For instance, | bicycles are so
carried without charge at Los Angeles and
vicinity, at San Jose, at Sacramento, and
so on. The circuits of Sacramento and
San Francisco overlap so that bicycles are
carried free of charge a distance of nearly
100 miles to the capital city. This cir
cumstance is said to be the case
in other sections of the State, so
that bicycles practically go as bag
gage and free of charge in Cali
fornia. The declaration / a representa
tive of the company that the bill would
not be fought in the Legislature is a great
victory for the wheelmen of the State,
with their 20,000 votes, and will doubtless
be good news to them.
But the ardent cyclist will not have
everything his own way. His wheel can
go anywhere in Ihe State without a trans
portation tax, but when it comes to going
out of the State then is when the com
pany will come in et the finish. The
interstate commerce law interferes at the
State line in favor of the railroad, and it
is there that the railroad company will
get even. This situation will fall heaviest
on the professional wheelman and on the
owners of wheels going on a trip or visit
into another State. A bicycle is free bag
gage till it gets to the State line, then iris
subject to charge.
The cycle clubs of San Francisco have a
representation at Sacramento, and there
are, also, so many wheelmen in the capi
tal city that it is safe to say considerable
vigilance will be exercised till the bill has
passed. ________________
WIDOW MORTON MAYSTAY
Grand Army Veterans Will
Not See Her Only Shelter
Torn Down.
Aged Mother and Invalid Daughter
Made Homeless by Order of
tbe Supervisors.
The pathetic story of the aged mother
whose only shelter from the elements has
been ordered torn down by the Board of
Supervisors lias its ', sequel now in an ef
fort that is being. made by war veterans to
help the widow in her hour of greatest
need of kindly friends.
The story, as first published in The
I Call last Sunday, relates how a hard
â¢ ship was unintentionally imposed by the
City fathers who signed an order for the
removal within ten days from last Satur
day of a building upon a part of Fremont
street near Bryant that is not and never
has been a r thoroughfare because of a
hill that naturally obstructs the end of
the street. SSBÂ§9B9BB'-WI
An ex-Supervisor wishes to use that
little bit of street to pile lumber during
the erection of a prospective box factory
on a neighboring lot.
The poor little two-story building is on
the public street up near a steep bluff and
practically out of the way. It has been
there for fourteen years. It ,'. is the. only
home of Mrs. Ellen Norton, a widow 70
years of age, who lives there with her in
valid daughter. She has been a widow for
over seven years, but in all that time,
tbough.not in enviable circumstances, she
has never once applied for Â» aid to the
Grand Army of the Republic or to Gar
field Post of this City, of which her hus
band/was a respected member.
' : General E. S. Salomon has interested
himself in the case and with him are asso
ciated members of Garfield Post, who are
eager to help the widow of their former
comrade. A committee will call upon the
new Board of ; Supervisors this forenoon
and endeavor to have the board grant the
widow sufficient time for her new-found
friends to provide some' place for her to
live. If she be compelled to vacate ac
cording to the order she has no place in
the world to go, except, perhaps, to the
biz institution over the hill, and there the
Grand Army men will not see her forced
to gratify the commercial wish of a cap
italist. J *^^^i^PS^^^^_K_HSffiSÃ

Mr. Austin So Says in Speaking
of the Park Commission's
- Accounts.
Explains the Missing ioo Tons of Coa
as a Clerical Eric, Long
Ago Adjusted.
With regard to a threatened investiga
tion of certain accounts of the Park Com
mission by the Grand Jury Park Commis
sioner Austin says the commision will
anticipate the Grand Jury and investigate
them itself. He does not expect tbat
either of the two investigations will de
velop anything over which the public
need be alarmed. With regard to the
alleged disappearance of 100 tons of coal
from the face of the earth he says it was a
mere clerical error, to which his attention
was called Ion*; ago and which error was
promptlty corrected, and with the correc
tion ended interest in the matter, he
thought.
The allegation that the commission is
paying too much for bay he thought
would bear investigation. The late Com
missioner Stow agreed with Scott &
MrCord upon $14 as the price for hay.
.With the passiner of time the price went
down and Mr. Austin went to Scott & Mc-
Cord and told them they ought to reduce
the figure. They cut the price to $11.
This, it is admitted, may still be higher
than the military authorities pay for feed,
but Mr. Austin does not think it too high
for the Al quality of bay that they pet,
and which he thinks the sturdy horses
employed in the park require.
As to the allegation that the commis
sion has already paid Gray Bros, more
money on account for the concrete work
done on the bridge than the whole amount
of their contract, he says he does not be
lieve it. This is one of the things that he
says will be looked into, and if they find
it to be true then they will insist that
Gray Bros, return the money. He thinks
the allegation will be discovered to be
without foundation when fully investi
gated.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures '
at station indicate maximum temperature for the I
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of I
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect, pojn s or equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
ward "hieâ" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather'and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington i
coast. When the pressure is high In the interior !
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend I
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable:
but when the "low* is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is nnprob i
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and ;
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder j
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions â¢
will produce an opposite result.

golden wedding to-morrow at the home of
their eldest daughter in Milledgeviile, Ga.
Numerous congratulatory telegrams were

of the buildings at Berkeley to-day many
a kind word concerning the celebrated
scientist and the joy which the rising sun
to-morrow will bring to him and his help

Besides a large number of personal con

warded to him the student body sent a
missive of good wishes and the committee
of ten who aie preparing for the grand re

The following message was dispatched

Professor Joseph Le Conte, Milledgcille^Ga.:
The University of California desires to tender '
to you and Mrs. Le Conte a reception at the

Berkeley and Stanford, the regents and

alumni of Berkeley, the Governor of the j
State and all the prominent educators and
friends- of the professor will be among the ;
specially invited guests..
Dr. Le Conte, though now in his seventy- j
fourth year, ii as hale and hearty ns he |
was ten years ago, and but for a slight !
drooping of the shoulders hi-* frame >-$ as !
straight and as well preserved as thosb of j
most men of 50. He is the oldest professor 1
at the university, both as to his years amd j â¢
as to the period of time he has ; " been i '
teaching at Berkeley.'
For twenty-six. years he has held the
chair of geology. As a mark of his v^eor ]
and strength it nÂ»ed only to be said that |
for the last seven ye:- rs prior to his de- j
parture on his recent vacation he missed |
only one lecture engagement.
Of all the professors at the university
there is none more beloved than Dr. Le
Conte and none whom the students de- I
light more to honor.

OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 13.â The remains
of the man recovered from the estuary
yesterday have been identified as those of
John C. McCarthy, son of the lighthouse
keeper at the Oakland estuary.
The deceased was last seen the day after
Christmas, and on that evening he disap
peared. He was seen by a man who
keeps the bar at the pier to whistle to his
father from the wharf, for the purpose of
attracting his attention. It is supposed
that the young man afterward descended
the steps in quest of a boat and slipped off
into' the water. It was blowing very

"Will Try to Beat the Guard.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Jan. 13.â The Police
Department had its first open-air drill j
ih:s afternoon. Some time ago three !
companies of twelve men each were j
formed in the department, and to-day two
ol them were taken out to Boulevard Ter
race and put through various military
movements. Some of the men as yet
would compare very unfavorably with the
Horse Guards, but they take great inter
est in' the drill and will probably appear
as an evolutionary body on Washington's
birthday, when they declare they will
outdo the National Guard.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
bOS Broadway, Jan. 13. ,)
The blue pencil has been used in society
and Oakland is disturbed. For some
time the Lakeside set has determined
upon a purging of the list of honor which
controls their affiliation, and to-day the
result of their labors was made known.
The list of invited guests to the Wednes
day-night Cotillon Club, which held its
cotillon to-night, tells the story. It was
made public to-day, and there were heart
breakings and avowals of revenge : from
Piedmont to Frnitvale.
Many names hitherto accepted have
been dropped, and the' victims want to
know on whom to fasten the responsi
bility. They are not likely to attain their
object, however, for the applications for
invitations were addressed to a box in the
postoffice, and those â  who were not in
cluded in the list cannot discover by whom
tbat particular box is owned.
The present social upheaval is a sequel
to the trouble that broke up the Deux
Temps Club last season. When it was re
organized it was discovered that the pre
vious membership made it too promis
cuous, and the blue pencil was freely used.
This action caused much feeling, and it
has extended to the Cotillon Club. There
are no officers of the club, and of course
no one can blame the lady patronesses
for being dropped, as it is well Known tbat
they place such matters in the hands of a
select committee. The committee is so
select that : its identity can never be dis
covered. ::
The secrecy observed in the process of
expurgation gives all the opportunity de
sired to work off personal "misunder
standings." but this lime the blue pencil
has been used with a freedom never dared
before.
The following list is the most exclusive
the Lakeside set has yet issued and any
name that is missing has no redress and
tells its own story by Its absence:

They Do Not Like to Pay for Burning

OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 13.â , scav
engers are not disposed to pay for the cre
mating of their collections if â¢ they can
heip it. This morning several of them
hauled their loads to the new crematory,
which has a contract with the city, but
they refused to pay in advance to have the
material burned, and the contractors re
fused to allow them to dump the garbage.
Two special officers have been: appointed
to see that the scavengers do not break
the city ordinance, and three men have
already been arrested.' The crematory is
kept going all tbo time and is a. pro
nounced success, not a suggestion of odor
being detected in the vicinity.

The Republican Committee Will

A Keen Desire on the Part of the

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Brodway, Jan. 13. J
The delegates to the Municipal Repub-
can Convention will be named Friday
night, and next Monday evening the con
vention will assemble. Dr.' Pardee has
proved during the past few days that all
that his friend Leach has said about his
grit and energy during the past four years
has not been undeserved. The doctor has
completely ignored the suggestion of his
late friend to retire, and the result has
shown that he has carried almost the en
tire Republican party and in fuct two
thirds of the voting community with him.
At last night's meeting Dr. Pardee
greeted the fellow-members of bis com
mittee as "Fellow Boodlers," at which
'-re was an uproarious laugh. Great ef
forts have been made by the bolters to
creep under the protection of the regular
Republican camp, but they have not been
met half way, as their , influence 'is re
garded as nil, and all the overtures have
come fiom the small side. .'""* .'â '.'..;â . :."â â -.
Nobody believes the sensational stories
that were circulated about boodle and
rival water .companies, and they have
been hurled % bac_ ' into. the, camp
whence they came with terrific force, and'
the stupid attempt to disrupt the Repub
lican party for selfish or other motives
has been a fiat failure. -
In explanation of his position Mr. Leach
published the following statement to
night:
Happily the gentlemen constituting the
committee are above reproach or suspicion of
wrongdoing, and by, the cry thai has been
raised it is probable tbat each one of the com
mittee will have a keener sense of the re
sponsibilities they have assumed, and will in
sist on selecting his quota of the convention
without allowing some outsider to do it lor
him, and l*thls way the schemers and pur
chasers of the City Committee will be pre
vented from reaping the fruit of the Infamous
bargain. â ,yj* r -IÂ«tÃE3*^^
Under the circumstances the committee and
convention have a very difficult task per
form, but with the: proper exercise of vigi
lance and attendance to the duties imposed, it
is possible for them to create a city ticket that
will be acceptable |to the people and one that
will receive the support of the Republican
party. :::.â  :â ..'.".'".â  ."'â¢'<-â¢ -.-" -â'-'-:.*:.: â  'â â "';â  , 'â '.:

Now that these; things are known and the
political knavery has been exposed the way
for the committee has been made somewhat
clearer, while the duties have been made more
responsible.
Dr. Pardee and the other representa
tives of the Republican party who are
arranging for the.- convention -. declare
openly tutti they do not with Mr.Leach

DAY HELD IN 'CONTEMPT.
His Attorneys Willi Sin- Out a Writ of
Habeas Corpu (To- Morrow.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. * Justice
Morris to-day charged Constable Day with
contempt of .court in refusing to take two
prisoners to the .County .; Jail when sen
tenced. Constable Day will appear before
the court at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning
for sentence. In the meanwhile Constable
yon Kopf took â  the ; prisoners .; to J the 1 jail,
but will refuse ; to take his brother-officer
to-morrow if committed for contempt by
the j Judge. Then the court will be
blocked.
Much interest is being manifested in
the case and Messrs. Tappan and Simpson
have been r tamed by 1 Constable: Day to
keep him out of Sheriff; White's clutches.
They will â  proceed cud habeas corpus as:
soon as: Justice. Morris finds him; guilty
and fixes the penally.
The point raised by them is that no law
can v compel afi man to perform a service
without "/ compensation. If that \be good;
law, they * say," a Constable" ': from Liver-;:
more '- could r; be compelled to make two
trips a dny to Oakland and pay "his own
railroad ' fare,' whictilwould force him into
insolvency. The amount of the fare cuts
no figure in the case; it .is the principal
they contend against. v: i
â ?'â  In response to a question from Justice
Morris a Deputy District i Attorney said :'
'Constables v? are -:â¢ compelled â â ( to -l execute
every process *of / 1 aw, regardless fof com
pensation."-The outcome of to-morrow's
proceedings will be watched \ with in

An Experience of Which Auditor Snow Would Rob Oakland.
--.-â¢..-v. ' ' -
acquaintances in this, city. "What has I
I happened is all right," said Mr. Sellier to
j day. "My daughter will accompany us tor
| a pleasure trip. You see, the whole matter
I came about in this way: -
"I have always had a great affection for
Nora, and she has been at our house fre
quently with my daughter. I have some
mining matters to atttnd to in Paris, and
recently ; when I stated that I was going
to visit tbat city Miss Harnden, wbo is a
very clever young lady, said she wished
she could take such a trip. â .-â  I was quite
willing that she should do so, and in
vited her to go along. She replied, how
ever, that she could not very well do that
unless she went as my wile. Now, there
you have it all. I â  have already heard
three young ladies wish ; that they were
the fortunate ones." .
A visit to the Harnden home, on Broad
way, this- afternoon brought forth a
prompt denial from a younger Miss
Harnden that her sister was engaged or
indenaed to be married. In answer to the
question: whether she was not already
married the young lady hesitated at first,
but finally laughingly denied that fact.
She first said her sister was too busy to be
seen, then that she- hud fled: on sight of
the reporter. Then there came a ; voice
from an adjoining room. "It is all a false
hood," it said. "I am not going to .be
married, nor am I engaged. I have always
looked upon Mr. Sellier as old enough to
be my grandfather."

JOSE DIES OF OLD AGE.
He Was Chief of the Famous
, Old .'Mission Tribe of
Indians.
- â -â¢â -â ..-... :
Many of His Brethren Attend His
Funeral at Mission
San Jose.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 13." "; J
. The most interesting Indian of the old
tribe that inhabited this: courtly .-mi! the
time of the early missions, was. burled at
Mission San Jose Monday afternoon.
Jose Antonio was chief of the tribe, and
according to the Indian records he. was
71 years of age when he died; although lit
is believed he was considerably older. The
chief's death was due to old as*e and gan
grene, and his funeral was attended by a
large number of â  his tribesmen.
: For half a century Antonio has been an
interesting figure -I the Indian settlement
between Sunol and : Pleasanton. . In: that
neighborhood: hundred oi campers end
the summer months, and to all of them
the old chief was an unending source': of
interest and amusement. He told stirring
tales of the time when the missions were
flourishing before the day of the Ameri
can, nnd he was never civilized to the
point where be would acknowledge 'that
the country was the better for their com
ing. He was. as much an Indian at his
death as at his' birth.
;. Old: Antonio married about three times
during bis: life, and some of his comrades
declare that he had four wives. Judging
by the 'many little Indians who bear ; his
name in the canyon, the latter number is
probably correct. For v the past twenty
years he has been an object of veneration
and respect to his tribesmen, and to.wi'hin
a ew months he* was the presiding officer
' of tneT tribe "/and â¢';' his " opinions were re
garded as law. : ',': â â ' . . : ' -.â -'.- '.., .:(-;-;
Not long ago he 'recounted the experi
ences of the Indian -for the past sixty
years. He told how when the ".-Angelus".
used to be heard from the "belfry of the
Mission the Indians were goo i and 'per
formed their evening duty by the church.
He deeply-regretted the law that robbed
the missions of â : their paternal value and
' made them mere religious institutions.
He recalled the institution of the pueblos,
which system, however, was never given a
thorough test before the occupation by the
Americans succeeded itf^^^^^S^xXfi
'. Judging from r old Antonio's many remi
niscences and the accuracy^with w*nich he
referred to] the details of ante-pioneer life
in Alameda -j County, lie must have ""*. been
not less than 80 years of age. " :
Miners Killed by an ' Explosion.
'WARD, Colo., Jan. 13. -Word has just
been received from^thu Adit tunnel, some
distance from here, that four miners,
whose names are unknown at the present
time, were killed and, frightfully mangled
by an explosion of giant-powder in on<* of
the bi_* drifts of the 'J property. Several
others were injured. The Adit is one of
the iargest properties in the county. The
cause is presumed to be a premature blast."
WARRANTS MUST BE PAID
A Welcome - Measure in Favor
of the Employes of the.
City.
When Funds Are Empty the Council
Should See That They Are
, Replenished
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 13. j
If a bill now at Sacramento shall be
come a law the business of the shaver of
municipal warrants will have to seeK an
other channel through which to turn his
money with the least possible trouble. In
Oakland, where the bill was prepared, the
benefit of such a measure will be very
marked. ' '\K * â ' ::'x/- : j''
Warrants of city employes and con
tractors are on file in the Auditor's office
in Oakland for nine months of the year,
and in consequ-nce the owners are forced
to. discount them at a ruinous rate of in
terest. So well is this known to a certain
class of money-lenders that there are more
shingles hanging out in this city convey
ing the information that municipal war
rants wiil be cashed than any other city of
its siz * in the country. Auditor Snow,
the- author of the bill, who has had four
terms of experience with municipal ac
counts, has drawn up the bill, which is as
follows: * â -,
Whenever in any fiscal year at any time
prior to the day- on which the last installment
of taxes becomes delinquent the Auditor of
any incorporated city shall report to the Coun
cil that, mere is insufficient money in the
treasury available for the payment of undis
puted claims against sat city the Council of
said city may authorize the Mayor and the
City Treasurer to sign and sell bonds of said
city. .- ' , - .
Said bonds shall be of the denomination of
$1000 and bear interest from the date of Issue
at a rate not to exceed 4}i per cent per annum.
Said bonds shall be paid i.i the same order as
issued irom the first taxes collected by said
city, provided that all of the bonds issued
shall not exceed in amount the sum of the
claims reported, to the Council by the Auditor,
nor at any t.me exceed in the aggregate 90 per
cent of the taxes to b; collected and available
lor the expenses of the current fiscal year.
In explaining the matter to-day Mr.
Snow said: â  "There are hundreds of city
employe-, especially! in the Street Depart
ment, who have to pay at the rate of irom
6 to 60 , per cent per annum for having
their warrants cashed. I have known in
stances where the discount has been at the
rate of 100 percent. , â  â  â  .. i
"Contractors when figuring on city work
make an allowance for the fact that they
will have to discount their warrant, and
in this manner the city loses a far larger
sum of money than if would pay by issu
ing small bonds for a few months at a low
rate of interest.
"In the East city councils are empow
ered to.do this, and the system works well.
It is not a new idea in municipal History,
although it is new on tnis coast." -, '.; -

were i controlled before the glycerine ma- j

trophe was averted.', ; " ;_
The cause of the explosion will probably i
never be known.-gfegfffflJÃWm*^
For a time the people in the vicinity
were in a frightful state of trepidation. It
was soon noised around that the fire was i
approaching the glycerine: tank, .and i
everybody knew, that a 'rightful explosion >
would ensile if it ever rea-tied the : tank, j
All the employes worked like demons to;
turn the fire in another direction, .and it j
was some time before their efforts proved i
successful.

BEATEN OUT BY
HIS COMELY SISTER
Preston Turned Down by
Sweet Faverdaie in
a Stake.
- â 
Buckwa, California and Others
Finished Back in the
Ruck.
Petrarch Wins for John Humphreys-
Applause Finally Scores Winning
Bracketsâ Three Forks Wins. . ...
Bundled up to the ears with mufflers
and garbed in overcoats that would make
an Eskimo sweat mighty beads of pers
piration, a good-sized crowd saw Sweet
Faverdaie and Preston, full brother and
sister, fight it out for supremacy at the
conclusion of the Naglee selling stake, de
cided at Oakland track yesterday. The
distance was seven furlongs and the win
ning horse drew down $950. Seven lined
up at the barrier, and by a streak of rare
good luck Eddie Jones landed Sweet
Faverdaie winner in a hard drive. The
event was decided under selling . con
ditions, and the betti<ig favored Pat
Dunne's pair, Preston, 109, and Salvable,
with 101 up, at odds of 9to 5. Next in de
mand was the clown horse, Buckwa,
against which threes were laid, with Cali
fornia and the Burns & Waterbouse pair.
Sweet Faverdaie and Salisbury 11, fancied
in the order named.
Tbe field was sent away nicely bunched.
Buckwa was in front for a second and
then fell back. Â»aring the half pole
"Willie Martin., on Preston, concluded to
cut loose and pulled away from his com
pany. At the head of the stretch, with a
fair lead over California and Salisbury 11,
it looked very sweet ior the brown horse.
At this juncture Jones, astride . Sweet
Faverdaie, running in almost last position,
saw a gap and took a chance. He soon
found himself near the front and engaged
in debate with Preston. Martin, on the
latter, resorted to his cleverest tactics, but
could not withstand the rush, ana was
beaten a neck, with Chartreuse II third at
his mount's neck. It was a most exciting
finish, and the time, 1:27, marked a fast
race.
Of the other events run favorites in the â¢
betting were successful in three. Thorpe !
headed the list of successful jockeys by j
reaching the wire first on two winners.
Bookmaker John Humphreys took down
the purse offered for the opening mile
event with his recent purchase, Petrarch.
Second choice in the betting, he downed
Ezell's Unity, the 2 to 1 favorite, a bead
in 1:43. Billy McCJoskey was a close
third.
Scratches were numerous among the
original twenty entries for the second
race, a six-furlong selling affair, and Pur
ser's mare Applause going to the gate a 4
to 5 choice, passed the judges three-parts
of a length in advance of Fiy in 1:14^.
The latter sprinter made a bold bid ior
the money. .
The wise ones considered the mile and a
sixteenth run a good thing for Ostler Joe,
which horse ruled a7to 10 favorite. In a
drive through the stretch Coady managed
to get Bey del Dandidospast tne line firs'.,
a length in front of the favorite in the
excellent time of 1:48, Thorpe on Monita
was a good third.
Three Forks, 8 to 5 favorite for the mile
and a quarter handicap hurdle event,
finished ahead of the well-backed imp.
Autonomy without much effort. JO C,
ridden by Charles Weber, was a good
third.
The Burns & Waterhouse entry
Candelaria struck oil out of the can in the
final six furlong dash and won from the
80 toi shot Personne hands down. Ber
narduio the second choice, secured the
show.
NOTES.
Riley Grannan considered California to
have a great chance in the stake event

THE FLY-CASTING CLUB.
The City Nimrods Discus* Handicaps,
Preserves and Fish Protection.
The San Francisco Fly-casting Club met
Wednesday evening in the Flood building.
Secretary Vogelsang . read a letter from
the Chicago Fly-casting Club in which the
writer made a most complimentary men
tion of the remarkable long-distance cast,
103 feet, made by Harry Golcher at Stow
Lake in Golden Gate Park last fall, which
broke the world's record. President
Mansfield read a letter from H. L. Stanton
of the Chicago Club in which Mr. Stanton
made the suggestion that the "two clubs
meet in a contest upon neutral ground.
Considerable time was consumed in dis
cussing, handicaps in fly-casting. It was
decided not to have any handicap in cast
ing for delicacy and accuracy. Golcher's
record, however, was a stumbling block,
and several suggestions were made look
ing to placing the other members of the
club upon an equal footing in long-dis
tance casting.
The president appointed Messrs. Young,
Turner and Smith as a committee to dis
cus? a plan for an equitable handicap, to
be reported at the next meeting.
A long discussion followed as to the ad
visability of communicating with tne
Senators and Assemblymen now at Sac
ramento with a view of passing a bill pro
hibiting the catching of fish under five or
six inches in length. Action was deferred.
The president announced that Stow
Lake will not be full again until ab ut the !
first of next month. If in the meantime
any of tbe members desire to practice
they can go to Mountain Lake, near the
Marine Hospital.
The question of the club acquiring a
lake or a' stream to be kept as a preserve
for its own use was also discussed and
several desirable lakes and streams were
spoken of, but no action was taken in the
matter.
Governor Budd in Town.
Governor James H. Budd came down from
Sacramento last night, and is at the Palace.
Tne Governor said he came to confer with
Attorney- General Fitzgerald in regard to
drawing up some of the different laws which
are nee-led, to which extended notice has al
ready been given. He 'will be here probably
for two or three days.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 14, 1897.
LEPERS FAVOR A
FEDERAL HOSPITAL
Petition for One to Be
Presented to the
President.
It Is Signed by Some of the
Most Influential Names
in the City.
.â¢ â  , â 
Dr. G. L. Fitch, Who Prepared It,
/ ;. Urges the Vital Necessity of
the New Institution.
The lepers- confined at the Pesthouse in
San Francisco are very strongly in favor
of a National hospital, as has recently,
been recommended by a. number of the
most prominent men in this City.
They give a number of reasons for this
desire, prominent among which are these:
In a big National institution more atten
tion would be given to them, and they
would thus be more likely to get the ad
vantage of any new discoveries that would
mitigate their dreadful disea.e as well as
arouse more efforts among scientific in
vestigators to find some remedy that
would cure or greatly relieve leprosy.
They say they would have the advantage
of more society. Tbey would have large
grounds and have the opportunity of ex
ercise and occupation, and a selection
could be made of a warm and dry climate,
which, they say, is. very favorable to their
disease. They suffer a great deal from
cold in the extremities, and one of the ef
lects of leprosy is to make the patient very
sensitive to chilly weather. One' of the
â¢most intelligent of the white lepers here,
Frank Bent, says that when he came here,
ten years ago, he thought this climate
would benefit him, but be finds it too cold
and feels confident he would be benefited
by a warmer and drier climate.
The Japanese remedy for leprosy,
"Goto," has been used on tbe patients
here with much success. It #is not re
garded as a cure, but it greatly mitigates
the disease. The first lot tbey got last
summer, which was donated by- subscrip
tions and cost about $250, they have just
used the last of, out an appropriation has
been made by the Supervisors for double
the quantity of the first order, and a ship
ment is on the way here now.. One of the
patients was so much helped by tbe Goto
medicine that the blotches entirely disap
peared from bis face. . This remedy 'of a
Japanese physician consists of a medicated
bath, 300 herb pills per day and tbe regular
use of an herb tea. One 01 the lepers, Pepa
loo, will not take Dr. Goto's treatment, as
he prefers to trust to tbe use of strychnine.
Superintendent J. P.. Keating thinks
there should Le a State hospital established
for lepers, and ti.at it is not fair for ibe
City to have to take care ,of them, for
only 25 per cent were residents of San Fran
cisco. He also thinks , the. wish of tbe
lepers for a Federal sanitarium is partly
caused by the unsanitary condition of the
building in which they are confined lt
leaks, admits the cold winds and tbey
have no fire\ .'.-/"; '
Dr. George '; L. Fitch of this City has
been active in preparing and circulating a
petition for the establishment of a single
National leper sanitarium; to accommo
date all those afflicted by the dread dis
ease in the United States. The lull sig
nificance of the project may " best be
gathered, from the petition, as follows:
To the President and the Congress of the United
Statesâ Gentlemen: Your attention is mo.-t
respectfully called to the following facts:
irstâ That . there - are, as far as can be relia
bly ascertained, about 300 lepers in the United
States. They arc -mostly from foreign coun
tries, few being . native citizens. They are not
congregated in any one particular locality,
but are largely dispersed all over the Union.
Secondâ By reason of their feebleness In the
advanced stages and the general fears of the
people as to contact with them in "any con
dition they, are practically helpless and are
debarred from eutering Into thu usual avoca
tions of life.
This forces them in most all cases to become
public charges. ..-. . *
Thirdâ Since they are mostly foreigners,
and therefore here by National invitation,
their care should be assumed by the General
Government and not left to the precarious at
sistance of individuals or to communities with
out adequate preparations for. taeir main
nance. - - â  -â â¢-'.
Fourthâ lt is claimed by high scientific
authority thai leprosy is not contagious, but
this view is not generally accepted by the
public, and ' hence the latter does not extend
to these unfortunates ; the. same mercy and
gentle confederation as to other invalids.
Fifthâ lt will be much cheaper for the entire
people if all the lepers should be concen
trated in a single colony and , placed , under
competent authority, with proper -physicians,
nurses, medicines, etc.:
Sixthâ The expense of : providing a -sanita
rium for ail the lepers known io be in the
Uni.ed States is estimated to be about . $150,
--000..," '.":.Â« '"' -:
This would reasonable â¢ include the cost of
2500 acres of land at $10 per pcre, $60,000 for
the buil lings, etc., and $05,000 tor the gather
it.g of the patients and their maintenance the
first year. . . â¢â¢
: Seventh lt is an attested fact, well known to
medical experts . familiar - with the disease,
that lepers need a warm and even* c iraate.
being very sensitively affected by the- cold or
by sudden changes in the weather, c- - -
Eighthâ ln the Coast range of mountains of
Caliiornla, south of, San Francisco.: there are
some choice locations in which the ciimato is
very even all the year around, and is by reason
of its mildness, comparative- isolation and yet
read accessibility, â  admirably : suited ' lor . the
comfort of such unfortunates. â '.'.>;.
Ninthâ Sucha sanitarium should be national
in character and placed under the charge of
the Marine Hospital department â¢â  or a special
commission. ' . , ". â 
.' Tenthâ That a sanitarium is â  the j profound
need of these afflicted people, is humane, is; in
sympathy with the genius of our age, is the
demand, of .medical science in the way, of
analysis! and, treatment and is a splendid
memorial worthy of this Christian civilization.

ALEXIS JAN IN
DIED SUDDENLY
One of the Most Noted
Mining Engineers in
the Country.
Collapse of- His Nervous System
Given as the Cause of
. Death.
His Body Will Be Crematedâ The
Ashes Will B; Placid in the
Family Vault.
At an early hour yesterday afternoon
Alexis Janin, one of the most noted min
ing experts in the United States, died
quite suddenly at the residence of his
brother in this City.
Mr. Janin had been ailing for the last
year, but of late his illness assumed a more
serious aspect, and since the holidays he
has been confined to the house. Yester
day morning he arose as usual seemingly
in the best of spirits and iemarked that
he felt much better than he had for sev
eral days past. Alter luncheon he retired
to his bedroom and soon fell asleep.
Shortly after a member of the household
was alarmed by hearing heavy breathing,
and upon investigation found Mr. Janin
dead. He had passed peacefully away
while sleeping.
Mr. Janin was born in New Orleans in
i 846. He was educated abroad taking his
first degree at Sorbonne, the head Gov
ernment school in Paris. Later he at
tended college at Freiberg in Germany,
where he tooK up the profession of mining
engineer.
At the same college were Ross Browne,
Jack Hammond and other college mates,
who later became prominent engineers of
America.
After devoting twelve years to study
abroad, Mr. Janin came to this country,
when he immediately became identified
with the Comstock mines in the develop
ment of a process for working the tail
ings, or residue flowing from the mills.
He then took charge of the Meadow Val
ley Mill, situated at Builionville, Nevada,
making frequent trips to mining camps
both in the United States, Mexico and
South America for the purchase of mines.
He was a particularly reliable man in
starting up the reduction works when
mines were opened, and in determining
by what process the ore should be worked.
For many years Mr. Janin has had his
office in this City, where he was princi
pally occupied in metallurgical investiga
tion.
Mr. Janin' was unmarried. The imme
diate cause of his death was the sudden
collapse of his nervous system.
The date of the funeral has not been
decided, but his body will be cremated
and the ashes will rest in the family vault
in New Orleans.
ALL ABOUT A DOG SHOW.
The St. Bernard Club in Favor of the
Olympic Gun Club Giving a
Bench Show.
The St. Bernard Club met last evening
in the office of the Breeder and Sports
man, and after transacting routine busi
ness Mr. Bushnell reported that as a
member of a committee appointed by the
Pacific Kennel Club to procure the views
of the officers of the Olympic Gun Club
relative to the holding of a bench show
this year in this City he had seen the
president of the Olympic Gun Club and
some of its officers, and they were only
too pleased to give an exhibition under
the club's auspices, provided the Pacific
Kennel Club concluded not to hold a
show.
Mr. Bushnell spoke strongly in favor of
the Olympic Gun Club giving a show.it
bein.- now in a position to handle such a
difficult undertaking with success.
After some discussion the representa
tives of the St. Bernard Club, who were
present, acquiesced in the views advanced
by Mr. Bushnell, and Mr. McCracken in
troduced the following resolution, which
met with general approval :
Resolved, That the St. Bernard Club of Cali
fornia, which is the strongest specialty club
on the coast, strongly indorses the suggestion
that the Pacific Kennel Club turn over the
funds in its treasury and consolidate with the
Olympic Gun Club, to which association we of
the St. Bernard Club promise our most hearty
and undivided support.
A committee composed of Messrs. Brown
and McCracken was appointed to confer
with the directors of the Olympic Gun
Club at a meeting which will be held next
Wednesday evening at 1309 Van Ness
avenue.
The club suggested the name of James
Mortimer as the gentleman whom it
would favor for judge of the proposed
bench show that is, if "the exhibition
should be held under the auspices of the
Olympic Gun Club. A special meeting of
the Pacific Kennel Club will be held this
evening.
MISS BATEMAN EESIGNS.
The Leading Lady of the Grand Pleads
Failing Health.
Miss Victory Bateman, leading lady of
the Grand Opera-house Company, has re
signed her position and will not appear
alter Saturday evening next. This is in
spite of a three months' contract.
Various reasons are assigned for the
sudden step, that of Miss Bateman hers If
being ill-health. She says that hard work
has shattered her nerves and she finds
that she must either resign or breakdown.
There is also a romantic flavor lent to
tbe resignation through rumors of a serious
heart affection on the part of Miss Bate
man. The versatile leading lady is cur
rently said to be suffering from the ab
sence of Howard Kyle, late leading man
of the Grand. It is stated that Miss Bate
man and Mr. Kyle were engaged to be
ICEW TO-DAT.

married, but that Mr. Kyle suddenly
threw up his theatrical engagement and
went East. A lovers' : quarrel is assigned
as the cause of rupture between the dram
atic stars. Anyway, since his departure
Miss Bateman is said to have visibly
drooped, and now comes as a climax the
announcement of her resignation and
prospective departure.
Mr. Kyle is in .Salt Lake, but Miss Bate
man is believed to have Philadelphia in
her mind's eye as her destination. â

GRAND MASTER C. L. J. W. PIERCE
Of the Grand Consistory of California, who presided yesterday afternoon at its
opening session and reviewed the Masonic events of the past year in this State.
The flag, which floats over the Masonic Temple only during the actual ses
sions of the Consistory, has a field of black above and white below, the Consis
tory colors, with a centrally placed red Teutonic cross surrounded by a narrow
band of yellow conspicuously emblazoned upon it. . .
ruary. Upon that occasion a number of
fine speeches are expected. 'iVy
The new vice-president, Colonel John C.
Currier, states that their society is one of
the most potent factors in the promotion
of harmony between the once opposing
sections of the Union. There are about
225 members and there is a branch asso

HE DID NOT RESIGN.
The Key. W. â _>.' Williams of Plymouth
Church Still Its Pastor Despite
Diosentions.
Nothing was said last evening at the
annual meeting of Plymouth Congrega
tional Church about the resignation of
Rev. W. D. Williams. A week previously
Dr. Williams resigned and made the resig
nation absolute, but his congregation re
fused to consider it, and there the matter
rested.
When the church met the time was
deemed appropriate for action with regard
to the pastor, but contrary to expectations
not even a word was said tbat would indi
cate feeling. The pastor presided and ap
peared as full of enthusiasm as ever over
church matters. After the business had
come to an end he explained that his rela
tions with the congregation were cordial
and unchanged by time.
"All there is to it," said, he, "is that I
presented my resignation a week ago, and
it was refused. There the matter stands,
and if anything is done it must be de
novo. I have calls from two churches in
the East, and desire to go back East to
have my children attend my old college.
But I cannot accept either call till I give
up this church â one cannot hold two
positions."
An active member of tbe congregation
slated that distention had sprung up in
1 Plymouth Church and not a few of the
old members felt that it would be good
for the church to hove a change of pastors.
Mr. Williams has been an earnest, devoted
worker, an interesting preacher and Was
in sympathy with his congregation, but
even more was wanted. A strong feeling
has assorted itself for a man whose per
sonal magnetism would attract people to
him and then bold them in Plymouth
church. ' â  7*vÂ£ 7*, y."j, Â»â ..'â  .".. ' '.' .â,...",,_
At last night's rfteeting the voting for
two deacons to serve for three years as
successors to S.S. Smith and J. Q. Gar
field astonished the older members. W.
B. Sheppard was in the contest and led
the formerly popular deacons, bi3 vote
being 49, against Garfield's 4fi and Smith's
43. This was taken as evidence of a de
sire for change, and as 65 was necessary
for a choice no one was elected. Judge
Sawyer moved to adjourn until next
Wednesday evening, and the meeting dis
solved without settling upon deacons.
A interesting occasion is anticipated
Wednesday night.

tish Kite Free Accepted Masons, was
held in Masonic Temple yesterday after
noon, all the grand officers being present.
The reading of the proceedings of the
last held communication was dispensed
with, bat each member of the body was
furnished with a printed copy. '
The petition of seventeen candidates
for degrees and those of nine for admis
sion by affiliation were presented and re-
ferred to a committee, which subse
quently reported favorably upon each.

roviewed the events of the year. The
followed tne reading of the reports o
George J. Hobe, grand registrar, and S.
W. Levy, grand treasurer, which, with
the reports from subordinate bodies, were,

at the session to-day.
In the printed proceedings is the follow
ing recommendation :
We believe that the Grand Consistory shou'<:
remove from its roll all evidence of rescinded
charters and, therefore, recommend that th(
numbers of chartered bodies be revised and
renumbered in accordance with their rank o
seniority and that changes be made.
"In accordance with this recommendn
tion the San Francisco Lodge of Perfec
tion was numbered No. 1; that of Oaklan
No. 2; that of Los AneeJes No. 3; that of
Sacramento No. 4, and tbat of Marysvili <
No. 5.
The lodge of Marysville, Pacific, wa i
on the old roll as No. 2 and when it carat
to the reading of the announcement ihn
it had been, Changed to No. 5 there was i
strenuous objection from the Marysvili*
district and, after some discussion, th<
matter was referred to the committee o.
grievances. . : r *
After the disposition of the matter th>
grand body was called off until 10 o'clocl
this morning, when reports of committee:
will be received. In the : afternoon th
election of officers will be held. ,

Chinese Ilatchetinen Grow Restless
*. From Inaction, â Latest Method in
Scientific Assassination.
The Chinese are again growing restless.
The pagan spirit, has reposed at ease for
fourteen moons and thinks so good a
ecord as a law-abiding citizen should
â serve as partial exoneration for resurrect
ing the hatchet.
During the last few evenings the high
under has been much in evidence on the
â¢meets of Chinatown and. mysterious con
ferences in regular meeting places have
not been infrequen t. To those acquainted
\iih Chinese tactics this boldness pre
faces anothe r murderous outbreak.
Since Chew Sing, a See Yup man, was
issassinated on Jackson street, supposedly
n revenge for the murder of a man on
s;ocklon street, the Celestial mind has
.ot been entirely at rest. It is an indig
itty hard for the See Yups to bear that
me of their number should have crossed
he Stygian River last, and if this condi
. ion of affairs be allowed to continue
much longer, it will appear in the light of
. i public disgrace.
One of the latest tricks of the highbind
â¢rs commends itself for its ingenuity, if
lothing else. When a prominent high
binder starts out in search of a man
narked as his victim he carries no weap-,
â¢ -ns. If the police, knowing his record,
earch him, they will find him unarmed.
. But along with him go two or three
uher hatchetmen not known to be such.
One of these carries the weapon intended
;o consummate the deed. When the vie-,
iiu is found he hands the revolver or
*nife over to the one selected to do the
shooting. Chen Ging's death illustrates
* his latest method of scientific murder.

AS TO POINTS OF LAW.
Judge Morrow Shows That State Courts
Must Not Interfere With Federal
Tribunals.
United States District Judge Morrow*
rendered an opinion Yesterday in the
matter of the application of A. C. Forsyth,
receiver for the Oregon Pacific Railroad
Company, for a writ of mandamus. For
syth was appointed receiver for the com
pany by one of the State courts. Charles
Clark was the receiver for the same com
pany in Oregon. In the case of R. D.
Chandler against the steamship Wil
lamette Valley, a decree was entered in
the United States District Court on June
9, 1896, directing the clerk, Southard Hoff
man, to pay to Charles Clark, receiver of
the Oregon Pacific Railroad Company,
claimant of the steamship Willamette
Valley and of the surplus proceeds de
rived from its sale, or to his attorneys,
after payment of all costs in the case, the
remnant of the proceeds in the registry ol
the court, amounting to $23,524 45. Later
in the year the clerk of the court and the
Judge signed two checks drawn on the
Assistant Treasurer of the United States.
One was made payable to Charles Clark,
receiver, for $19,918 29 and the other was
in favor of Page & Eels, attorneys, for
$3606 16.
Tne check for Clark was placed in an
envelope and addressed to him at Corn
wallis, Or., but before it was deposited in
the United States ' mail, the clerk was
served by the Sheriff with a writ of execu
tion issued out of the Superior Court of
San Francisco in an action pending in that
court entitled W. A. Swineion against the
Oregon Pacific Railroad Company. In
that action a judgment had been rendered
against the defendant for the sums of $15,
--363 78 and $1115 75 costs. With the writ of
execution, the Sheriff served a notice on
the clerk that all debts owing by him to
the Oregon Pacific Railroad Company and
the credits and other personal property in
his possession and under his control
belonging to the company were attached
in â  pursuance of said writ. A similar
writ was served upon Page & Eells.
On September 28 Superior Judge J. M.
Sewell in this action made an order re
quiring Southaid; Hoffman and Charles
Page and concerning property in their
custody * and i control, and concerning
money owing to the Oregon Pacific Rail
road Company, and enjoining tbem from
transferring said property. After hearing
the testimony in the I case Judge Sewell
appointed A. C. Forsyth Â receiver of the
railroad company's property, ; and this
order included^ the property (checks) in
the â¢, hands ; of. Clerk Hoffman and At
torney Page. The decree was subse
quently modified : by : Judge Sewell so as
not to infrige upon the: jurisdiction of the
District* Court, but he allowed the re
ceiver, Forsyth, authority to | begin pro
ceedings for * the recovery the check as
he might be advised by the District Court..
; Thus Ââ¢ the ' action Jin garnishment f was
begun against Southard Hoffman to secure
the check in his hands, nÂ»t 'as an in
dividual but as clerk of the United States
District Court." .. ' " ' : Â« â¢
Judge Morrow in his opinion says:
i I consider it equally improper to direct a
suit to be brought in the State court against
Colonel Hoffman or -to order him to deliver
the check to the receiver. ; â¢**â  . ' â¢â¢â¢ â 
Ij After discussing the case in twenty-four
pages of type-written matter Judge Mor
row says: "It is clear, therefore, that un
der the principles of law referred to as ap
plied yto the . circumstances p "and facts of
'.the case at bar the petition should be dis
missed, and ;it is so ordered, and the cost
of this proceeding ,to be paid by the peti
tioner.".; v. : y : :--'''C:^'.'' : ~S"', ;'â :;/. 'â â¢.'â '"â  ~- ; '*-'-' â _'.'' : - V"v
hi In other words tho money was in Clerk
Hoffman's possession not as an individual,'
but "as an officer of the Federal court, and
was in fact in . the possession of; the court
itself. Hence ; the i Federal 7 court is : not
obliged to recognize a mandamus from
any State court.

late Henry and Walter Keney of that city.
