VIENNA, ACSTBIA, May 19.â The Neve
Freie Presse publishes a dispatch giving
an account of the landing of 4foo Greek
troops at Avlona, Albania, wi;h a view of
making an attack upon the roar of the
Ottoman force in Epirus. Learning of
this movement, Osman Pasha sent an
overwhelming Turkish force from Janina
to meet them. A battle ensued and lasted
for twenty-fcur hours. The Greeks were
defeated, retiring with a loss of -000 killed.
LONDON", Eng., May 19.â 1t is evident
from dispatches received here that the
Turkish advance guard continued its for
ward movement after the pourparlers for
an armistice began. Tue Greeks resisted,
and a series of ssirmishes ensued, in one
of which a foreign legion was involved.
Tne commander of the lesion, Captain Va
ralassi, was mortaliv wounded. The Turks
advanced to Antinitza, midway between
Dhomoko and Lamia, and the Greeks re
tired to the latter place.
The correspondent of the Morning Post,
who was with the Greek army at Dho
moKo, has reached Athens, from which
city he telegraphs that the retreat of the
Greeks was made in good orJer. The
moon brightly illuminated the rough
country through which the troops passed,
enabling tliem To readily see tneir way.
The Crown Prince displayed, grual cool
ness and courage.
A Constantinople resume of the official
view cf the situation, while claiming that
the Turkish demands are fnily justified,
declares that tbe Pone wouid not create a
difficulty regarding the payment of an m
demnitv or the ceision of Tnessaly, but
that it is impossible to modify its de
mands for the abolition of capitulations
in favor of Greek subjects in the Turkish
empire.
Should Europe attempt to forcibly com
pel tne Porte to yield this point, a situa
tion would be created which, it is declared,
would endanger the general peace. The
Porte could not be answerable for the
grave consequences that would follow the
inevitable excitement of the Turkish pop
ulace.

WASHINGTON. D C, May 19.â The
accident to the new drydock in the Brook

at first realized. It is now certain that
the navy will be unable to u^-e it again for
large vessels for six months and perhaps
longer. Rear Admiral Bunce telegraphed
Commodore Matthews, chief of the

Landing of General Smolenski's Troops From Halmyros and Re-enforcements From Athens at Stylida.
Stylida is a small town of 1800 inhabitants, beautifully situated on the northern side of the Gulf of Lamia. It is the seaport of Lamia, some ten miles to the
west, as well as all the Sphercheios Valley and the southern part of Thessaly. It is the only port now within reach of Prince Constantino's array on the Orthrys
Mountains, and is praciically the base of supplies.
on the Eastern coast, as the Port Royal
dock can lake none of the battle-ships ex
cept nt extraordinary stages of high tide,
which occur, as a rule, semi-annuolly.
Fortunately few of the battle-ships re

the possibility of some accident befalling
them which might render it imperative
for the ship to be taken from the water
without delay and that renders the situ
ation embarrassing.
The battle-ship lowa goes into commis

the next few months.
A GIRL'S AWFUL DEATH.
Her Father a Powerless Spectator Wh le
an Elevator Slcwy Crushes Out
Her Life.
BOSTON, Mass.. May 19. â Adelaide
Cogswell, a beautiful young woman 18
years of age, met a most horrible death
this afternoon, while attempting to run
her father's freicht elevator in the factory
of William E. Martin & Co. at 96 South
street. 1) sobedience cost her her life, as
her father had strictly enjoined her not to
touch the elevator, and women were never
permitted to ride on it.
One of the witnesses of the scene was
her father. The cruel mechinery pinned
down the unfortunate girl and slowly
crushed her life our, while her heart-rend
ing screams tilled the entire bluet. Men
wept and turned away their faces power
less to reach her. The elevator literally
tore her head from her body and rolled it
at the feet of the spectators. Just then
the engine was stopped, but it waa too
late. The factory employes were so
shocked by the tragedy that they were
unfitted for work to-day.

Exciting: Scene Following: the Brutal
Killing of a Woman by Her
Ex-Husband.
RANDSBURG, Cat-., May 10.â Mrs.
Emily Davidson, one of the first women
to come to this rough mining camp to
seek her fortune, was murdered by her
lormer husband on the main street
at II o'clock this morning. Twenty min
utes later the murderer was hurried out ot
town by a po^se of citizens' committee
members, just in time to escape a mob
which had gathered to lynch him. His
guards had little time to spare at that, for
the leaden of the mob, learning that they
had been tricked, were hurryinc to pre
vent the escape of their intended prey,
and the men in charge of Davidson were
compelled to make a show of arms 10 drive
them back.
It is probable that Davidson would hare
been lynched within ten minutes after Ms
crime was commuted, but several cool
headed citizens sent the mob on a wild
goose chase to the Office saloon by telling
them that a meeting of the citizens' com
mittee was to be held there at once to de
cide the fate of the ruurderftr. While the
miners were gathering at the Office, prep
arations were being made to hurry David
son to Mojave by team, and before the
rougli bordur men knew that they had
been the victims of a strategy the assas
sin and his guards bad started on their
way.
For several months the woman had con
ducted a cheap restaurant on Butte
avenue. Shortly after she opened it
Davidson came and took charge of the
kitchen. Soon he began to find fault with
her management, and about three weeks
ago he left for Los Angeles. From, that
city Davidson sent many letters and tele
grams nsking his w:fe to come to him, but
no attention was paid to them. Finally
he sent word that, he would come and
compel her to return witb him. The
woman expecteJ trouble, but not of a
serious character, and she was not sur
prised when he appeared this morning.
Davidson arrived on the Kramer stage
at 10 o'clock and at once went to the res
taurant.
"I see you're not glad at my coming,"
said the ex-husband when his salutation
to her on entering the restaurant was
not answered.
"I don't want anything to do with
you," was hei reply.
Without pivin? the intruder furtner
notice, Mrs. Davidson went out through
the kitchen door to a neighboring store
for a bottle of vinegar. Davidson awaited
her return, and went out to meet her. She
tried to avoid him by crossine the
street, but he crossed over af'.er her. On
meeting her he aaid something, and sev
eral bystanders heard her exclaim, "No,
no.no. no!" Davidson graÂ»i ed one of
her hands and drew a pistol. The woman
struck the weapon aside, and the bullet
crashed through the bottle she was carry
ing. She then tried to shield her face
from' a second bullet, which entered and
passtd through her ritrht shoulder. As
the woman was falling Davidson shot her
in the left, side. . The fourth sbot was fired
at her prostrate - bo<3y, but missed its
mart. . Ââ * i *Â«;. .-.r -,-_
Men who had witnessed the ihooting â
it was all done so quickly that they had
not time to interfere â came running up,
and while some seized the assassin and
hustled him off to the camp's jail others
raised the dying woman and carried her
into the restaurant. She lived but a few
minutes.
On the way to the lock-up Davidson
raved like a madman, declaring that he
was crazy and repeatedly calling for a re
volver with which to end his life. When
searched in his cell another loaded pistol
was found on his person.
Soon the news of thp brutal murder
spread and men came running from all
directions. Low muttering 3 soon devel
oped into shon.s from the more hot
headed ones to hang Davidson at once.
The friends ot law and order" hastily de
ckled to entice the mob away, and passed
out word that the Citizens' Committee
would meet at onct.
In the meantime the citizens' commit
tee was not idle. A light wagon with the
best span of mules in the district was
fitted out an 1 held in readiness, while
Citizen Fucard went among the people
telling them to hurry to the meeting
place. Fugard worked his vÂ» - ay along
Butte avenue toward the calaboose. On
his arrival there (he team hove in sight,
and a prominent mine-owner, growing
suspicious, asked Fugard:
"Are you going to take that fellow
away?"
Fugard looked at his questioner a mo
ment and exclaimed, "What, me? Not
much," and with a look of disgust wended
his way to the lockup and ordered the
committeemen to hurry.
As soon as the prisoner was brought
out and hurried into the wagon a cry
went up, but Constable Bohannan's shot
gun and the pistols of the other four com
antteeinen held the most anxious of the
would-be lynchers ut bay. The mules
were whipped up and dashed out of town,
followed by yells of rage from the baffled
miners.
Davidson was taken to Bakersfield to
night.

CAREER OF TUE DA.TIDSOSS.
(rained Notoriety in a Sensational Suit
Againnt a Millionaire.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 19.â David
I. Davidson and the woman known as
Mrs. Emily Davidson, passing as his wife,
had a checkers:! career in Los Angeles.
At 117 East First street they kept a res
taurant, which was sometimes controlled
by both together and from time to time
was the individual property of one or t.e
other. The apparent domestic trouble be
tween the two did not have any lasting
effect upon their financial affairs here,
for the ownership of their establishment
seemed to pass back and forth between
ibem.
The Davidsons first came into promi
nence last October, when they figured in a
sensational denouement, that has since
been denounced as blackmail. Davidson,
accompanied by two detectives, found
Mrs. Davidson in company with Henry
Worthington, a Denver millionaire, then
sojourning here, and from evidence then
obtained in a dramatic way a divorce suit
was instigated by Davidson on statutory
grounds. He was given a decree about
four months ago.
After the divorce was granted Davidson
went to Randsburg and opened a restau
rant, leaving tne Los Angeles place in
charge of Emily. Two weeks later she
followed him and Davidson came back.
Tne fact that they were divorced did not
seem to interfere in the leist with their
mode of life. D ivid^on came to Los An
geles to prosecute a suit against Worth
in gton for $1-0,000 for alienating the affec
tions ot his wife.
The case was tried in the Superior Court
on the 12th inst. and resulted in a verdict
for the defendant. In his answer to the
complaint against him Wo; thing ton de
nounced the Davidsons as a pair of black
mailers and immoral persons, and de
clared that tno woman was not David
son's wife and the two had engaged in a
conspiracy to extort money from him.
Davidson left this city Tuesday nicht,
accompanied as far as the station by E. A.
Bartlett, bis steward, who claims that
Davidson gave him the restaurant here.
Bartlett says that I c believes the murder
of Mrs. Davidson to have been long pre
meditated, for before leaving this city
Davidson said to him:
"In case I don't come back you take the
restaurant and run it for what you can
make out of it."
Bartlett says that when Davidson left
the city he had $1000 in money on his per
son and wore a $500 diamond pin.
Davidson's father is said to be a million
aire, living in Santa Cruz County, and he
has relatives in San Francisco.

IN A TILT.
Elklns Indulges In Bitter Invective
Against the Attitude of This
Country.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 19.â Tha
Cuban debate in the Senate to-day was
one to be long remembered. There was
an unusually large attendance of Sena
tors, and every seat in the galleries was
occupied. The regular debate was pre
ceded by running explanation and com
mentary on the subject of the famous in
terview which two members of the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations, Davi3 and
Foraker, had with the President and Sec
retary of State, when important informa
tion was imparted with the injunction
that the names of the American Consuls
in Cuba from whom it was derived should
not be made public lest they ini^ht be
subjected to injury or assassination.
While Foraker was explaining the cir
cumstances of his visit, he was asked
point blank whether he or the Secretary
of State had stated that the divulgence of
the names of the Consuls would involve
ihcir assassination. The reply was that
the statement was not made in just such
language, but was to that effect.
Cannon of Utah made a strong plea in
behalf of Cuba, and many of his most elo
quent periods were responded to by accla
mations from the galleries. "When I
came to this Senate," Cannon said, "there
were but three Iriends of the then Demo
cratic administration, consequently there
were but three anti- jingoes. Jingoism in
parties may come and pro, but among the
people it will go on forever.
"If to seizs that mad dog Wevler â that
ravisher of women, assassin of men and
crucifier of children â be jingoism, 70,000,000
of our citizens are jingoes. Tne other
263,000 of the population are some of them
in trade; few, tbann God, are in the news
paper business, and fewer still, but more
powerful, are members of this Senate.
[Laughter.]
"International law," he declared, "is a
gyve upon the wrists of tho republic and
a sword in the hands of tyranny. Inter
national law invoked this struggle. It is
not a barnacle, but a hissing serpent,
and it is our duty to crush its head with
our heel if we are bruised in so doing."
Referring to Hawley's assertion that the
United States was not prepared for war.
Cannon said it was better prepared for
war than for the inevitable National dis
integration that would follow on cow
ardice.
Foraker took a very advanced position
in favor of the recognition of belligerency.
He was replied to by Hoar, who in most
sarcastic and bitter tones characterized
the resolution as "a mouse followed by a
brass band of proclamation."
Foraker discussed the effect under par
liamentary law of the recognition of bel
ligerency and admitted, as Hoar bad
claimed yesterday, thai it would give
Spanish gunboats the right to search
American vessels.
"Kijrbt of search," Elkins broke in,
"means war." Resuming he said: "Isn't
it time the United Statea should cease to
police its waters iv the interest of Spain
and take a position of absolute neutrality?
The United States should not stand as a
quasi co-operator with Spain in this
brutal war. It is time to put an end to
such a covenant with sin and league with
hell, and by no vote of mine shall that un
boly alliance continue."
The Senate at 6 p. m. adjourned till to
morrow.

MORGAVS JttaOLUTIOy.
Vote to fio Taken in a JFnw Day* and It
HW Surely Fas*.
WASHINGTON, D. C. May 19.âMor
gan's resolution providing for tue recog
nition of Cuban belligerency will reach a
vote in the Senate in a very few days and
pass by a large majority. All indications
point to the approaching end of a Ions;
session of debate and tbe rapid breaking
down of the opposition forces. The voie
will be reached, moreover, by amicable
agreement and without resort todog-in
the-manger methods by members of con
flicting factions. The truth of the matter
ia that the opposition to the resolution
has broken down under the overwhelming
sentiment in its favor, so that its final
passage can now be prevented only by
the adoption of downrisht filibustering
tactics. No Republican Senator, not even
Hale or Hoar, appears willing to resort to
this method, and so after a few more
speeches have been made ami the cor
respondence called for by the Senate has
been submitted a vote will be tafcen by
common consent.
Several of tne managers among the Re
publicans are opposed 10 the Morgan reso
lution, but they are now alive to the wis
dom and necessity of permitting a vote to
be taken, and while the two subjects of
Cuba and the tariff may for a Jew days
run along side by side in the proceedings
of the Senate, the sentiment ot the ma
jority will prevail and the Morsran resolu
tion be adopted. It is quite possible that on
Monday an arrangement will be made in
open Senate for taking a vote. Mnny Re
publican Senators are still inclined to2
criticize the administration for its ap
parent desire to go slowin the Cuban mat
ter, and especially for its expressed deter
mination to withhold certain information
received from Consuls which they say
would be dangerous to make public for
fear that Spanish officials would vent
their indignation upon Consuls who over
their own signatures have sent informa
tion to the State Department damaging to
the cause of Spain. \
In the Senate this afternoon thÂ«re was a
very lively tilt between Foraker and
Eikins over the action of the administra
tion in comre'-ling Senators to act in the
dark by withholding information on the
Cuban question, and Foraker, with ap
parent cheerfulness, explained that it was
no fault of his, for he, if he had his way,
would publish all the facts broadcast to
the world to-morrow morning. Asa mem
ber of the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions Foraker bad been allowed to ex
amine some of the prescribed correspDnd
ence at the State Department. When he
sends the correspondence to tne Senate he
will withhold some of it perhaps per
manently, bat possibly only until it can
be submitted to tbe Senate in executive
session. . .

a < ri-ii in Spain.
MADRIu, Spain. May 18.â At a meet
ing of Liucra! Senators and Deputies to
day Senor Sagasta made an important
speech. He said:
"We have 200,000 troops in Cuba, but are
not even masters of the territory trodden
by our soldiers. At the same moment
Carlisrn is organizing itself in the peninÂ«
sula and menaces us with a new war,
thanks to the immunity it enjoys, while
the seeds of separatism are germinating
in some of the provinces. ]>'â  J
"The picture could not be gloomier. We
have war in Cuba and in the Philippines
and we have attempts at civil war at
home. The Government is not responsi
ble for them, but it is unfortunate in its
administration. Re.'orms in Cuba will not
solve t!ie Cuban problem.
"In the face of this situation the Liberal
i.arty has decided to break the truce it
has accordea the Government during tha
liiat two years. Tne Government has ei
isted until now because of the complais
ance of the Liberals. Henceforth the
Liberals will throw all the responsibility
upon tue Government."
The speech was greatly applauded. It
portends stormy sittings for both cham
bers. It is predicted that Canovas will be
thrown from power within a fortnight.
There is much excitement in political cir
cles.

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 19.â During
his speech on the Morgan resolution In
the Senate to-day Foraker read extracts
from consular reports to show the actual
existence of war in Cuba, but withheld
the names of the authors. He also read a
note from Secretary Oiney to the Spanish
Minister dated April 4, 1896, as follows:
We are interested as a civilized and Christian
nation in the speedy termination of civil strife
characterized by exceptional bitterness and
exceptional excesses on the part of both com
batants. We are interested in the non-inter
ruption oi the extensive tra-ie relations which
have been and should continue to be of great
advantage to both countries
The authority of Spain is subverted and the
functions of its Government are in abeyance
or practically suspended throughout the
greater part of the island. Outside of the
towns still under Spanish rule, anarchy, law
lessness and terrorism are rampant. The re
sult is a systemiitic war upon the industries
of the island and upon ail means by which
the}' are carried on.
Speaking of the interest of th= United
Slates in thiÂ« struggle, Oiney in the same
(ommun'.catioa said:
We are interested in the prevention of that
wholesale destruction of property on the
island which is making no discrimination be
tween enemies and neutrals and is utterly
destroying many American investments
that should be of immense value and is
impoverishing great numbers of American
citizens. On all these questions and in all
taese ways the interest of the United States
in the existing situation in Cuba yields only
to that of Spain herself and has led many
good and honest persons to insist that inter
vention to terminate the conflict is the imme
diate and imperative duty of the United
States.
In reply De Lome says there is no effec
tual way to pacify Cuba unless it begins
with the absolute submission of the rebels
to Spain. He points out that the United
States could greatly contribute to it- paci
fication by a ricorous hunting down of
filibusters who start from our shores.

WASHINGTON, D. tt, May 19.â "0h,
we'll give 'em something to eat," said
Representative Hitt to-day in reply to a
question as to the possibility of a majority
in the House to-morrow upon the Senate
joint resolution appropriating $50,000 for
the relief of Americans suffering in Cuba.
â¢He explained that he meant the Commit
tee on Rules would report an order for its
consideration and that it would pass. He
taid there should be no debate.
Mr. Bailey, the Democratic leader, said:
"Should the present minority report
recommending Morgan's belligerency res
olution be laken up in connection with
the relief proposition, I am not sure yet
what ouÃht to be done about debate. If
we can get twenty minutes on a side 1
think we will have the best of them. But
whatever the Republicans propose we
thai! oppose until it conies to the passage
ot the joint resolution, that we'll all vote
tor, of course, but first we want to go on
record as favoring tha belligerency resolu

Legacies.
i
By Means of Smuggled Letters He
Raises Hopes That Are
Never Realized.
TRENTON. N. J., May 19â Secretary
Shearer of the American Tract Society of
New York came to Trenton to-day to in
vestigate a letter he had received from
Convict Edward Stoddard it reference to
the will of the late A. J. Davis of Butte,
Mont. Stoddard is serving eight years
for forgery. Recently he sent a letter to
the American Tract Society in which he
claimed to have been the author of the
forged will in the Davis case which was
set aside. He said he knew where the
original will was and that the will gave
$10,000 each to the Tract Society, the
American Bible Society and the American
Board of Foreign Missions and large
Sums to other institutions and relatives.
Secretary Shearer saw Keeper Moore
and was soon convinced that Stoddard is a
liar and is using the prison as headquar
ters to carry on a confidence game. He
aiso learned that Stoddard some months
ago had written a letter to Colonel Inger
sol!, counsel in the Davis will contest, in
which he gave an altogether different
story about the contents of the will, the
whereabouts of which he claimed to
know.
Several months ago Stoddard smuggled
a letter to Ada Richmond, the actress, in
which he claimed to know of the exis
tence of documents that would establish
her right to part of the fortune of the late
John Stetson of Boston. She and her
lawyer came to Trenton, and after an in
terview with Stoddard they were con
vinced that he was attempting to secure
money from them and that he was a
fraud.
Later Stoddard smuggled out another
letter, directed to Mrs. John Stetson, in
which he tried to induce her to buy infor
mation which, he said, would be valuable
to her. Mrs. Stetson also declined his
offer.
Stoddard is an expert penman and has
served time in Connecticut, Illinois and
Tennessee. He escaped from Tennessee
by forging an application for pardon. By
his own confession he was in the Tennes
see prison at tue time he claims to have
secured possession of the Davis will, and
of which he intimates he made a forged
copy.
To a reporter Stoddard refused to talk,
except to say that he would teil his story
for $2000; that he had a good thing and
would not gg yp it away.
ORDERED TO INDICT THE COURT.
Tennessee Judge Insiructs a Grand Jury
to Utilize Knowledge That He
Was Drunk.
CHATTANOOGA,TENN.,May 19.â Judge
Estill of this judicial circuit, who has
borne a reputation fcr fearlessness in court,
to-day summoned the Grand Jury into
bis nresence and thus addressed himseli
to Foreman Samuel Morgan:
"Mr. Foreman, I understand you hnve
information that the Judge of this court
was intoxicated at the last term of court.
If such is a fact it is \ our duty to indict
the Judge of this court for drunkenness."
"I-have-beard-it-said," stammered the
foreman, "that you were drunk at that
lime."
"Then, Mr. Foreman," sad the Judge,
"it is your plain duty to indict this court,
and I instruct you to do so if there is suffi
cient evidence to warrant you in so rind
ing.' '
"I did not know," said the foreman,
"that we had a right to indict the court."
"I charge you," said Judge Esiili, in a
commanding voice, "to investigate the
matter thoroughly, and, if there is one
particle oi ground upon which yon can do
so, to bring in an indictment against tlie
Judge of this court. Your duty is plain.
Do not shirk it."
hBUTGBRT'B CJ&K AT CHICAGO.
Inspector Sehaack'* Arbitrary Conduct
for the Prosecution.
CHICAGO, 111., May 19.â 1f Inspector
Sehaack fails to make out a case against
Adolph Leutgert, whom he charges with
murdering his wife, he is likely to meet
with serious trouble.
To-morrow Lawyer Vincent will prefer
charges against Sehaack and Chief Kepley
will be asked to dismiss him on theground
that he has violated the statutes in re
fusing to allow Vincient to see his client.
Anqther affair for the inspector to lace
is the habeas corpus proceedings in the
Superior Court. Judge Hutchinson's
order to produce the prisoner was not
complied with.
Hutchinson entered an order continu
ing the case until to-morrow, and direct
ins Bhaack to show why the order had not
been obeyed. This may place the inspec
tor in contempt of court
To-day Leutgert's sausage factory was
searched thoroughly, but little was lound
that could be considered of importance as
evidence. It will be no surprise to many
of the prosecution should make a failure
in its efforts to convict the prisoner.

INTERESTS THE COAST.
Work on ihe San Francisco Posicfffcs to
Be Pushed, and Oakland's Ap
propriation Passed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 19.â The
Senate to-day passed Senator Perkins' bill
appropriating $350,0)0 for anew postcilice
building at Oakland. This is the second
time that Senator Perkins has passed it
through the upper body of Congress.
Representative Hilborn is disheartened
over the prospect of being able to get it
through the House. He was not able to
secure its passage in the last Congress,
and there seems to be little chance that he
will be more successful at this time.
Representative Loud was at the Post
office Department to-day to see about the
removal of station X of the San Francisco
Postoffice, which is now located in the
Palace Hotel. This is a very important
sub-station. I< s revenues last year
amounted to $175,003. It has been, pro
posed to remove it to a point on Mission
street, within two blocks of the Palace
Hotel, as there is not room enough in the
hotel 10 accommodate such a big branch
ollice. Congressman Loud recommended
tlie change. It will not hi made at pres
ent, however.
Mr. Loud was also assured that additional
letter carriers would be furnishel for San
Josp The mail has never been delivered
in East or West Ban Jose, but will be
hereafter, and at least two additional car
riers will bi provided.
Congressman Loud said to The Call
correspondent to-ni^ht that it was the
purpose of the Treasury Department to
rush the work on the &an Francisco Post
office as rapidly as. possible, rie says i hat
he has not yet spoken to the Assistant
Secretary or to the supervising architect
about the fcind of stone to be used, for thÂ«
reason that he wanted them to get a good
start on t;<e work of removing the old
buildings and excavating tor the founda
tion before he broached the subj >ct oi tho
kind of stone to be used. Mr. Loud
thinks ie might ba well to construct the
lower part of the building of granite
and the upper part of sandstone. In this
case the sandstone might be furnished
from the Santa Cruz quarries, from which
the Stanford University and San Jose
postoffice building were constructed, or
from the Colusa sandstone quarries. If
granite is used, the Raymond quarries
may furnish the stone. In any event, he
believes that the stone used should be
aad will be the California product.
WORKING FOR BIMETALLISM.
The President's Interest in ihe Subjsct
and His Instructions to Our Ministers
at European Courts.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 19.â Great
interest is felt by President McKinley in
the preparatory measures to secure an in
ternational agreement for bimetallism,
and a dispatch has been sent by his di
rection through the State Department to
the United States Minister at St. Peters
burg, in which our four diplomatic rep
resentatives are instructed to pave the way
for the negotiations of the monetary com
missioners. Each isdirected by the Presi
dent to sound the ministry of the Govern
ment to which he is accredited as to the
chances for securing a conference between
the United States and other great nations
looking to a bimetallic agreement, nnd
urge that attention be given the repre
sentations of the commissioners.
France has shown sympathy witn the
purpose of the commission, and the ad
ministration hopes to secure its co-opera
tion in attaining delimte results. It is
said here that when the commissioners
have completea their negotiations the
Fren h Government will join with the
United Stutes in inviting other powers to
hold a monetary conference. T?iat is the
expectation of the President, and it is
probably the result of an intimation from
Paris.
GENERAL HARTS PROSPECTS.

WASHINGTON,- D. C. May 19.â Ex-
Atturney-Gener.il W. H. H. Hart has re
turned from New YorK. He exnects a
decision on the Blythe case on M iv 24.
and is certaiu that it will be ia fayor of
Florence.
General .Hart called on the President to
day. He says that he has received an
assurance thai he will either be appointed
Assistant Attorney-General, in charge of
Indian depredation capes before the Court
of Claim Â«. or else he will be made counsel
for the United Stat'fe in the foreclosure
suits against the Kansas Pacific and Cen
tral Pacific railroads. Mr. Hart says lie
has not much choice between the two
places. He says the President assured
him that his name was considered at the
Cabinet meeting to-day in connection
with the Assistant Attorney-Generalship,
but inasmuch as Attorney-General Mc-
Kenna was not present at the meeting no
action was taken. Mr. Hart believes that
his appointment depends on McKenna's
recommendation. Hart leaves for Cali
fornia at 3:40 o'clock to-morrow morning.

MISER-HERMIT'S
MISERABLE END
Death of a Famous Old
Maiden Lady at
Boston.
Hoarded Many Thousands of
Dollars, but Succumbs
to Starvation.
For Fifty Years No Human Foot
Save Her Own Had Crossed
Her Doorstep.
BOSTON, Mass, May 19.â Miss Fannie
Richardson, the famous wealthy old maid
miser-hermit, starved herself to death in
her impenetrable castle here to-day, while
from $50,000 to $100,000 lay there hoarded.
She was 76 ysars old. For half a century
no human foot save her own had crossed
her threshold and she had not stepped
outdoors in all that time. She
lived in a miserable tenement-house in
the very busiest section of tlie city. She
owned me house ana kept it looking as if
vacant all the time, all the blinds beine
closed and the doors locked.
Thousands of people pass the house
every day, but not one ever saw her and
very few know of her existence. The
milkman came every morning, but instead
of carrying his pint or half pint into the
house, he would stop beneath a side win
dow of the little alleyway and pour the
milk into a tinpail lowered for that pur
pose. By the same device her groceries
and other merchandise were delivered.
She had nothing to do with the world
outside, and devoted her energies to the
hoarding of money. She was without rela
tives, and it was not until after her death
that her mode of living was fully known.
The undertaker's visit to her rooms to
day revealed t c fact that they were very
scantily furnished, the whole value of the
old and ragged furniture not exceeding
$30. MiÃ3 Richardson was the daughter,
by his second wife, of Zaccheus Richard
son, who died before the war, and was a
tavern-keeper of considerable repute. The
big fire of 1859 swept away almost every
building in that section, but the old tavern
and the hermit's den still stood.
It is related that of iate years Miss
Richardson has had a great aversion to
the old tavern next door, and some say it
was because she was superstitious. A
stage-driver committed suicide by hang
ing in the building sixty year^ ago, and
thereafter it was said his ghost walked
there nights. What led Miss Kichardson
to take up her solitary life no one knows.
HAWAII AS A TERRITORY.
Minister Damon, En Route to the Quoen's
Jubilee. Taiks Annexation in
New York.
NEW YORK, N. \., May 19â Damon.
Minister of Finance of Hawaii, sailed on
the Teutonic to-day for England to offi
cially represent his country at the Queen's
Jubilee. Damon said be expected to re
turn during the laUer part of June and
might p.iy a visit to Washington, D. C,
He said:
"I am glad to see that interest in an
nexation has not waned within the last
four years. That gives us all the greatest
encouragement and leads us to hope that,
sooner or later, we may become a part of
this republic. Other questions have come
up, bc-LMi diseu-isft 1 and dropped, but tne
annexation of Hawaii is still ripe and
creates preat interest. I strongly favor
annexation, and cun say we are ready for
it nt any time. My opinion is that it will
be greatly to the advantage of the United
States in every way:
"Do yon â wish Hawaii to come in as a
State or a Territory ?" was asked.
"Not as a State for I recognize that with
our mixed population it would not be a
practical step. The political parties in
this country are so evenly divid -d that it
would not do to have Hawaii in the Union
as a State. We might then hold the
balance of power, and that would not be
desirable. In fact, that possibility would
prevent annexation. If we can come into
the Union as a Territory, or somewhat
like a State, that will suit us. We believe
the United States would not lose any
thing politically or otherwise, but would
gain much."
CANADIAN SEALERS.
Appearances of Dissatisfaction With the
Existing Regulations F xed by the
Pans Agreement.
OTTAWA, Ont.. May 19.â 1n the House
of Commons to-uight the Government was
asked if it is ;uv..re thi*t much dissatisfac
tion exists among the sealers of British
Columbia as to the operation of the pres
ent sealing regulations, and that the mat
ter is now the subject before the Legisla
ture o f that province.
In reply Hon. Davies, Minister of Ma
rine Fisheries, stated thai he is not aware
that sucn a condition of tinners is prevail
ing. He did Know, however, that consid
erable dissatisfaction had been shown of
late by Americans in respect to sealing
regulations; the United States Govern
ment had gone so fur as to represent to
the imperial Government the desirability
of amending the Paris agreement This
proposal had been referred to the Cana
dian Government for its approval or re
jection.
The Canadian Government did not see
any reason fordisturbing the ru!eÂ» adopted
under the riudings of the Paris tribunal,
and had, therefore, dissented from the
American view of a necessity existing for
modilying that agreement. He had no
hesitation in saying that he thought there
would be no alteration or amendment of
the agreement entered into between the
United Staies and Great Britain in regard
to Bering Sea sealing regulations, and that
'he same would continue in force and b'
undisturbed until made void by the expir
ation of the time of the agreement, which
would occur next year.
HANNA WILL BE CHOSEN.
Regarded as Certain That He Will Be
Elected United States Senator
to Succeed Himself.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 19.â Affairs in
the Jlei.ubhi.-an part? have taken such
shape now that Hanna will probably be
elected Senator with little opposition.
Thirteen counties have held conventions,
and all but two of them have indorsed
Hanna And their candidates for the Legis
lature have been instructed to vote for
him. The two opposing counties are
small ones and their opposition amounts
to very little. The State Central Coramit
tpe and Governor Bushnell'shome county
(Clarke) have iniJorsea Hanna. and the
Governor for re-election. The most
influential politicians identified with the
former factional trouble between Hanna
and Foraker have all along advocated
hsrmony, and their influence has finally
triumphed.
ThÂ« Democrats are almost sure to put
np a free-silver man for the place. John
R. McLean, editor of the .Enquirer, is the
most prominent candidate and will likely
be named.
OVATION TO CORBETT.
New York Marveled at the Physical De
ve/epment of Sharks/ in the Â£x
hibtion Bout.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 19.â Over 5000
persons cheered the pugilistic stars, Cor
bett, Maher, Sharkey and McCoy, who
appeared in exhibition bouts with friendly
partners to-night in the Palace Athletic
Club, under the management of William
A. Brady.
Sharkey boxed for exhibition rounds
with Tom Lansing. Snarkey's wonder
ful physique caused universal comment.
Huge muscles stood out like bunches of
steel wire. When he began lively box ng
the spectators marveled at his general ap-
Dearance and wondered how he would
come out with Maher. Lansing, who is
Kid McCoy's sparring partner, proved to
be exceptionally clever, ana altogether
the bout was most enjjyable to lovers oi
pugilism.
When Corbett came on to box wifh his
partner, Jim McVey, the big crowd arose
ana cheered him for five minutes. In re
ply to a demand for a speech the ex-cham
pion said :
"All I can say is that I think I am en
titled to another fight with Fitzsirumons.
That was the only time in my li!e that I
was on the floor for ten seconds, and there
is a question &a to the time at that.
"Other men have been defeated, and
they deserve another chance to regain
their lost iaurels. Tfcerefore, I believe
that Fitzsimmons should meet me again.
I am ready with any amount of money to
make another match with him for the
championship of the world."
This was greeted by loud cheers and
ones of ''That's right," after which Cor
bett boxed the usual lively exhibition
with iiis trainer. \V hen Corbett left the
ring he received an ovation which lasted
until he got to hi* dressing-room.

BRUTALLY SLAIN
Cold-Blooded Crime of a
Worthless Colored
Ruffian.
After Constantly Beating His
Wife He Finally Takes
Her Life.
The Victim a Hard-Working Cook
Who Had Supported Both
for Years.
MODESTO, Oal., May 19â This morn
ing, between 6 ana 7 o'clock, in the sub
urbs of this city, James Berry, a colored
ruffian, shot and instantly killed his wife,
Alice, in the most cold-blooded manner.
For some time it has been known among
the colored population that Berry was
treating his wife cruelly and that she lived
in constant fear of him, though she her
self was silenced by his threats to murder
her if she ever made complaint against
him.
It came out at the Coroner's inquest
that Berry was never known to work, but
that the wife labored hard for the support
of both. She had been a servant of the
late J. D. fcpencer np to bis death, and up
to yesterday she was engaged at the home
of J. F Tucker, a prominent real estate
agent Oi tnis city, who says Mrs. Berry
was in every way a good servant and a
good woman.
Yesterday Mrs. Berry's employers
noticed that she was in great distress, and
upon inquiry she reluctantly told of her
husband beating her the bight before and
of her terror of him. About 8 o'clock las:
night Sheriff .Purvis was called to Mr.
Tucker's residence, where ha found Berry,
and ordere;! him to go away and behave
himself. Berry went sullenly away, mut
tering to himself. Alice Berry did not
go home, but went to the house of a
neighbor, Mrs. Belle Campbell, and asked
to stay ail night. She was admitted and
given a room, where she remained until
disturbed, about half-past 6. by the ap
proach of her furious husband. The latter
went to the different doors and windows
knocking and demanding entrance, but
Mrs. Campbell, in obedience to the terri
faed wife, said nothing.
The murderer finally crept in at the sit
ting-room window, and, confronting Mrs.
Campbeil, asked for Alice. He received
the response, "She is not here," but at
this iuncture .Berry discovered his wife
leaving the place by the back way, and
followed in pursuit to a house near by,
which his wife had entered, he demanded
entrance, which was refused. He then
forced his way through tne house toward
the barn, caught his wife and proceeded
to beat her unmercifully, all the time
using fearfully obscene language.
As his wife tied across the street, dressed
only in her night clothes, toward Mrs.
Campbell's, the murderer fired at her. He
followed her to the room in which she
slept last night Hnd completed his work
by shooting a 38-caliber bullet through
her breast, severing the aortu. He then
walked out of doors, where he saw the
frightened Mrs. Campbell, and said: "She's
there. I've killed her." He afterward
went downtown and gave himself up to
Marshall Young, who was already look
ing for him.
The prisoner, when called on this after
noon Jor an interview dv a Call repre
sentative, swaggered forth with his hat on
one side of his bu' let head and said :
"All thai I have to say is that me and
my wife had a falling out Sunday night
find she called me a iiarand I slapped her.
Yesterday' she refused to go home with
me. That's all I got to say. Her and me
Had a falling-out and I shot her."

ten miles east of this city, at noon to-day.

self-destruction one day last week by
slashine his wrist with a knife. Coroner

MILL VALLEY, Cal., May 19.â This is
conductor's week on the Mill Valley

Hundreds of the Eastern visitors have ac

by President J. B. Stetson of the North
Pacilic Coast Railroad and President Sid

Thus far the weather has been perlect and
from tlie summit of ihe mountain the

unobstructed view of the bay of San Fran

18-year-o!d girl of this city, was subpenaed !
to appear a? a witness in the United
States court at Los Angeles tomorrow in
a Bakersfield counterfeiting ca^e. S:e
mysteriously disappeared about 9 o'clock
last evening. Diligent search has been
made all day, but so far not the slightest
trace of her has been found. Her parents
and friends are t: antic over ncr disap

for her action. She has always been
noted as a "home girl." It is said that
her testimony was very material for the

Miss Winslow was never in court, and it
is suggested that she became frightened
over having to testify. Another theory is
that the defense might be responsible for
her strange disappearance.

PHOENIX BRAVES
DANCE WITH JOY
Glad Hand for McCord
and the Hatchet
Buried.
Torchlight Procession Honors
the New Governor's Ap
pointment.
Skatch of the Career of the Man
Nominated as Arizona's
Chief Executive.
PHCENIX. Ariz.. May 19.â The news
came from Washington early this morn
ing that Myron H. McCord had been ap
pointed Governor of Arizona and Charles
Akers S cretary of the Territory.
In spite of the fierce and prolonged
struggle made against the appointment of
McCord by at least half of the Republican
party of the Territory, there is general re
joicing to-nicht and every evidence of
harmony in the party. T c streets of
Phoenix are ablaze with bonfires, and the
torchlight procession is greater than those
of last fall.
N. A. Morford, who led the home fight
against McCord, declares his allegiance to
the new Governor, believes that the ap
pointment will harmonize the warring
factions in the Republican party and that
McCord will make an able executive
officer.
Charles H. Akers, the new Secretary of
the Territory, is a well-known Prcscott
man whose appointment gives general
satisfaction.
At the ratification meeting held to-night
there were present representatives of all
the hitherto warring factions, and all of
them expressed their desiie to bury the
hatchet.
It is believed that ex-Governor Hughes,
under whose brief and troublesome ad
ministration McCord held an important
office, will be. tendered a similar position
by the new Governor. It is generally be
lieved that the President knew the fate of
his nominations in thÂ«Â» Senate before he
made them, and that McCord will be
speedily confirmed.
Myron H. McCord is the original Me-
Kinley man of Arizona, and at one time
serve*! in Congress with fie man who is
now President. He was born in McKeun
County, Pa., November 26, 1840, and In the
public schools of that county received his
aducation.
He engaged in the lumber business in
1854. locating at Shawano, Wis., where he
remained until 1874. He subsequently
removed to Merrill, in that State, where
he engaged in the manufacture of sash,
donrs and blfnris most successfully until
1884, when he became a banker ana was
one of the organizers of the First Nntionul
Bank anu a director in the same. During
the years 1873, 74,7 5 and '80 and '81, he
was a member r>f the Wisconsin Legisla
ture, and in 1883 he was elected from the
Ninth District of Wisconsin a member of
Conzre'S on the Republican ticket, serving
one term.
In ISO.'? he came to Arizona and locatpd
at Phnenix, where he engaged in farming
and fruit-raisin tr, which still continue to
claim his attention. He owns a fine ranch
and has lifty acres in fruit. In March,
1895. he was appointed citizen-member of
the Board of Control, and had charge in
part of the charitable, penal nnd reforma
tory motitutioris of the Territory.
Mr. Mc'ord is a thirty-second degree
Mason and a member of the Mystic Shrine.
DO MOT WANT HAWAII.
Marquis Ito at Vctoria Talks Politics,
Tariff and Friendship in Relation
to Ths Country.
VICTORIA, B. C, May 19.â Marquis
Ito, who arrived from Japan on the
steamer Empress (f India, spent all yes
terday at the quarantine station. He is
accompanied by Tosada, Marquis Kido
and S. Tokiokia of the imperial house
hold, and goes to London as adviser to
Prince Arisugawa, special Japanese envoy
to the Queen's jubilee.
Speaking of the reports that Japan seeks
to annex Hawaii, Ito denies this emphat
ically. He said: "If the Hawaiian Gov
ernment should offer us the islands we
would refuse them. They are too faraway
to be of any use to us. B sides. Japan
wishes to be on friendly termÂ« with the
United States, and the Washington Gov
ernment wonld be certain to regard our
taKing possession of the islands as an un
friendly act.
â¢'We have, however, certain treaty
rights nnd we propose to see that they
are respected," ho continued. 'The
people of America do not understand the
Japanese people. They dsM us with
other orientals, which is a mistake. We
have now a full measure of popular con
stitutional government, although we have
not yet become sufficiently familiarized
with the new conditions to adopt party
government as it exists in Great Britain
and America.
"In manufacturing we will be competi
tors, but only in China. We buy raw cot
ton in the United States, India an 1 China,
and make it un into yarn and sell it in
great quantities to the Chinese. But so
far as our competing in America or else
where is c< ncerned there need not be < c
casion for the least anxiety. Should Can
ada refuse in her new tariff to grant us
the tnost-favored-nation clause, we woud
protest, of course.
"We know of no reason why such ex
ceptional treatment should be accorded
us. Canada has nothing to fear from us
in any way, but everything to gain from
us."
The party will so direct to New York,
sailing thence on May 29 by the Gaseoigne
for Paris, w era they will meet Prince
Anisgawa and with him so to London for
the jubile3, returning by the Empress
route to Japan.
INDIANS IN A DIVORCE COURT.
Suit for a Legal Separation Brought by a
Ninet)-Year-Od Niece of Old
CA/e/ Seattle.
TACOMA, Wash., May 19.â There was
a sensation in the Superior Court to-day
when Mary Seattle, said to be a niece of
old Chief Seattle, apneared to tastifv in a
divorce suit she has brought against John
Seattle, her spouse. Interest was height
ened by the fact that both parties are
nearing the century mark, the defendant
being over 90 years old. John married
the widow Seattle five years ago, and alter
a stormy experience of two years went
back to his own ranch, consisting of eighty
acres of valuable valley land, which Mrs.
Seattle wants given to her. Her com
plaint alleges cruel treatment and failure
to provide, which John's answer denies in
vigorous whko-man fashion.
Mrs. Seattle spent most of the day on
the stand, ond assisted by an interpreter
detailtd tue utter wortblessr.ess oi her last
lord and master. She testified that hfe
never did anything for the suDport 01 the
family, but that he did buy the groceries,
bring up the wood, catch the salmon and
die toe potatoes.
From the evidence it appears that there
have Deen numerous cases in various
courts of the county wherein either one or
both of the Seattles have been engaged,
and both seem to possess a mania for tbe
excitement of the courts, with the knowl
edge that there will be the lawyers to pay.
After careuiliy going ovr the evi
dence, and asking many questions, Judae
Kean announced that the charges were
too general and supported by insufficient
evidence of crueliy to warrant a divorce.
This was related to the Seattles, who
shrugged their shoulders and walked out
of the courtroom with stoic indifference,
followed by an old Indian woman who
had been asleep on the courtroom floor.
HORRIBLE FAMINE IN CHINA.
Provoked bp Starvation Into Insurrection,
Many Were B headed and Hundreds
Are Killing Themselves.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 19.â A rising
of indignant citizens, provoked by famine,
against the law, has resulted in Chinese
mandarins in Hupeh slicing alive Tang
K:io and four other aristocrats, and cut
ting off the heads of six y of their follow
ers.
While Shanghai and, indeed, China
generally, has been contributing with
great liberality to the Indian famine, few
people seem aware that there is a famine
in China. Yet from Chung King in the
west to Ichang in the east, all through the
beautiful Yangtse gorges, a district famed
in song and legend, people are dying oi
hunger. Even around Shasi, further east,
they are famishing.
At Chung King two months ago a hun
dred people a day were said to be dying of
starvation and living skeletons were walk
ing about begging in the streets and
bodies lay dead on the river bank. Coun
try people crowded into the Vale of
Wanhsien to get something to eat. The
conditions are more hopeless toward
Kweichowfu and the gorge*. About three
miles from Kwoifu two little boys were
found out on the mountain side getting
grass to eat. The town was full of people
begging rice, but there was no rice to De
bouebt at any price nnd r.oining to eat at
all. Nearly all the people were taking
opium for the purpose of killing them
selves. Many of these people have money
and there is lots of rice, but the drought
has dried up the rivers and the rice can
not be got to them.

YANK AND JOHOY EEB.
A Pathetic Incident of One of thÂ« Bat-
ties of the Civil War.
William Wilkerson, who was for many
years jailer at Fayette County, and who
was noted for his fidelity to truth, related
the following pathetic incident of heroism
wlkich he witnessed shortly after the bat
tle of Richmond, Ky., in lgC2:
"A son of my friend, Hon. Cassius M.
Clay, was killed in the fight at Rchmond,
and it was my duty to visit the battlefield
to identify the body and take it to his
father's home. While riding slowly over
the sc^ne of the buttle I heard groans,
which I was sure came from a cornfield
near at hand. Looking down the corn
rows 1 soon dircovered two wounded sol
diers lying about forty yards apart. One
was a Federal and the other was a Con
federate. A cannon ball had broken and
terribly mangled bnth of the Confederate's
legs, while the Federal was shot through
tbe body and thiph.
â¢' 'I am dying for water,' I heard the
Federal say just as I discovered them. His
words sounded as if they came from a
parched mouth.
" 'I have some water in my canteen.
You are welcome to a drink if you'll comn
here,' said the Confederate, who hsd
feebiy raised his head from the ground to
look at his late enemy when he heard his
pitiful cry for water.
" 'I couldn't move to save my life,'
groaned the Federal, as he dropped his
hend to the Rround, while his whole body
qujvered with agony.
"Then I beheld an act of heroism which
held me spellbound nntii it was too late
for me to g ye the assistance I should have
rendered. The Confederate lifted his head
again and took another Jook at his
wounded foe, and I saw an expression ot
tender pity come over his pain-distorted
face as he said:
" 'Hold out a little longer, Yank, and I'il
try to come to you.' Then the brave feliow,
by digging his fingers in the ground and
catching hold of ttie cornstalks, painfuily
dragced himself to the Federal's side, the
blood from his mangled legs making a red
trail the entire distance. The tears ran
down my cheeks like rain, and, out of
sympathy for him, I groaned every time
he moved, but 1 was so lost to everything
except the fellow's heroism that I did not
once think of helping him.
"When the painful journey was finished
he offered his canteen to the Federal, who
took it and drank eagerly, the water seem
ing to sizzle as it passed down his parched
throat. Then with a deep sigh of relief
be reached out to the Confederate, and it
was plain to see as they clasped hands
and looted into each other's eyes that
whatever of hate may have ranKled once
in the hearts of ihese men had now piven
place to mutual sympathy and love. Even
while I watched them I snw the Confed
erate's body quiver as if in a spasm of
pain, and when his head dropped to tne
ground I knew that a hero bad crossed
the dark river. Tae Federal kissed the
dead hero's hand repeatedly and cried
like a child until I had him removed to
the hospital, where he. too, vied the next
day."â Lsxington and Leader.

HANFORD`S SKY
LIT WITH FIRE.
CorgeousEntertainment
for the Knights
of Pythias.
Elaborate Reception Prepared
for Supreme Chancellor
Colgrove.
Candidates Lining Up for Election
â D. O. O. K. Lodge Institutedâ
The Valley Road.
HANFOUD, Cat.., May 10.â It has been
8 very warm day, but the Grand Lodge of
the Knights of Pytiiias stuck to its work
morning and afternoon.
It was on the programme that the uni
formed rank and the members of the
Grand Lodge should parade during tbe
afternoon, but the Grand Lodge refused to
adjourn for the purpose and the event was
â postponed until this evening. Perhaps
the weather exerted some influence in
this matter, for within the opera-house
where tbe session is held the blinds arc all
drawn down until the place is in twilight,
but the atmosphere is comparatively cool.
At 6 o'clock, however, led by the Han
ford band in uniforms of white, the
Knights formed in procession and marched
through all the principal streets of the
city. They made a splendid showing, j
The parade was under command of 15. S.
Gourney, grand marshal, and was re
viewed by Brigadier-General C. P. Mc-
Glashan. The uniformed rank forces of
the camp were under command of Colonel
Fish of the Second Regiment, Colonel
Nerney had command of the brigade staff,
Captain Fisher of Division 1 and Captain
Mosgrave was commander of the local
division. They wore full-dress uniforms
and white helmets and marched to the
opera-house, where the Grand Lodee was
in waiting, under command of Colonel P.
C Lohmeyer. The uniformed rank formed
as aa escort, and the procession went over
the route laid out, which terminated at
the campground on Irwin street. There it
passed in review before the brigadier
general.
To-nijjht the Knights and ladie? are be
ing entertained at Hill's Hall. The hall
is handsomely dressed with the red, wnite
and gold, in which also the city is fes
tooned, swathed and bannered from end
to end. Palms, vines and flowers added j
10 the effect in the hall, while the whole
is brilliant with electric lights. The lo
cal committees have done their work well.
The music of the big local band is adding
all the melody that niieht be asked to
mate the affair enjoyable.
The work of the Grand Lodge is now
becoming exceedingly interesting to its
members and the Knights generally.
>.ew candidates have entered the Held for
the honor of entertaining the Grand
Lodge next year. They are Piacerville
and Healasburg. Nevada City, which
Las already enjoyed the honor, is marine
a play for pledges for 1*99. The greatest
interest is manifested. Red Bluff set up
a claim to having had an understanding
VitO the last session that she should be
honored this year. The other cities dis
pute thÂ»Â«, however, and declare it ia a fair
field, and that the best man, or the best
town, the one that offers or deserves the
most at the bands of the order at this
moment, should win. The representa
tives of the several towns have printed
tickets and are circulating them and their
arguments busily.
But the contest between the ambitions
and enterprising cities rales somewhat
before the interest manifested in the elec
tion of officers. Grand Chancellor Mc-
Glashan retires naturally by rule; by un
written law the vice grand, W. H. Grand of
"Woodland, succeeds to the office, while C.
L. Patton of San Francisco, now grand
prelate, by this same law becomes vice
grand.
The fight that is on is for grand prelate,
nnd for this office these are candidates:
H. R. Arndt ol San tÂ»ieeo, State Senator
E. J. Wolfe of San Francisco, and Joeph
Colegrove and .1. H. Liggett, of Sacra
mento. The contest for this place, which
places the successful candidate in direct
line for grand chancellor and is equiva
lent, indeed, to electing him to the office
two years hence, is, of course, of the warm
est description.
For grand keeper of the records and
Feal?, Colonel Herman Sbaffner of San
Francisco, who hes held the office for so
many year?, will be chosen again.. Grand
Master cf the Exchequer Steve G. Little of
Dixon, will also be re-elected.
For grand master-at-arms there are two
candidates, J. H. Abbott ol" Stockton and
F. W. G. JMorosco of San Francisco. TherÂ«
may be others. This office w;:l ue awarded
on a geographical basis arcording as the
election of the higher officers in contest
may be determined.
There are three trustees to be elected,
and so far as heard from there are five
candidates. They are C. O. Alkire of
Riverside, C. O. Clarke of Mott, F. Â£. Uor
rigan of Merced. Colonel A. Perrier of San
Francisco, I. lrwin of Oceanside and
George Saunders of San Francisco.
||For the office of supreme representa
tive there is another contest hotter than
the weather. To be a supreme represen
tative one must be a past grand chancellor.
The newest of these has entered the tizht
in his own enereetic fashion, but he has
for competitor? a distinguished list. They
are Judge A. J. Buckles 01 Sutsun, T. j.
Crowiey of San Rafael, Carl E. Lindray
of Santa Cruz. George E. Church of Fresno
and Walker C. Graves of San Francisco.
James Johnson of Sacramento will be
elected inner guard, ana J. H. Biackman
of Sti-ckton will probably oe elected outer
guard. The election will be held on Fri
day.
To-morrow the Grand Lodge Will give
another day of sharp attention to business.
By the evening train from the north,
Supreme Chancellor Colgrove, the highest
officer of the order, will arrive. Past
Supreme Representative Eii T. Blackmer
of San Diego, has been dispatched to meet
him at the State line. Past Grand Chan
cellora Stanton L. Carter, George Samueis
and T. J. Crowley will meet him at Gosh
en. Here he will be met at the depot by
i!ie entire Grand I^odgeandthe Uniformed
Rank and riding in a four horse carriage,
will be escorted to the quarters reserved
for him at the Aborn. He will after
ward bo escorted to the lodgeroom, where
he will ba formally welcomed by the
Mayor and City officials.
The opera-house will be open to the
public for the time and the people will
have the privil<^9 of hearing tbe highest
officer of the ofoer in the world tell them
what Pythianism is and what it is doing.
The supreme chancellor, who comes direct
from a session of the grand lodge in Ore
gon, will go from here to Arizona to the
grand lodge of that State, ana from there
he will go to Juneau, Alaska, to institute
the order in that Territory. Alaska
Lodge No. 1 has been oreanized by Past
Grand Chancellor F. A. Brooks, formerly
of California Lodge No.l of San Francisco,
who is now at that fur northern point as
agent of the Pacilic Coast Steamship Com-
pany.
A lodge of the D. O. O. X., which is to
Pythianism what the Shrine is to Masonry
was instituted here to-night.
Every member of the Grand Ixidge was
to-itay presented with a souvenir 1-pound
box of niisins.
The Grand Temple, Ftaihbme Sisters, in
session here, has twenty-five of the thirty
six temples of the State represented by an
attendance of sixty delegates.
The grand officers in attendance are:
I.yd.a Monroe of lliverside, grand chief;
Mary Fitzgerald of Sacramento, grand
senior; Ada McGuire of San Francisco,
grand jinior; Clara Belle Far no of Oak
land, grand manager; Louisa Holmes of
East Oakland, g-Â»nd M. of R. and C. ;
Mrs. Conway of Mercpd, grand outer
guard; Mrs. Weldon of Grass Valley, past
grand chief; Mrs. Katzenstein of Sacra
mento and Mrs. Madiien of Oakland, su
preme rppresentatives. The report of
the grand chief revealed a rapid growth,
of the order. Tnere nave been eleven new
temples organized during the past y*Â»ar,
ana the total membership numbers 2000
in this State. The election of officers will
take place to-morrow.
To-morrow evening after the reception
at the opera-house to Supreme Chan
PYTHIAN KNIGHTS Who Are Prominent in the Council:
o f the Order at Hanford.
cellor Colgrove, knights and ladies and
their friends will be driven to the Lucerne :
Vineyard, where there will be a reception I
and dance. Superintendent (hittemlen
is making tbe most elaborate prepara
tions for the affair. He has transformed
his immense dining hall, which is a com
plete bunding in itself, into a ballroom.
He has bad professional decorators at
work for several days, and is practically
putting a new floor down for the dance.
Carriages will be enlisted without limit to I
carry the guests to and fro. A splendid
collation, with an ocean of claret punch,
is being prepared, and thÂ« sky will be lit
with fireworks.
The work of the Grand Lodge will con
clude on Friday, but every member, Witt
all the ladies, will remain over for the big
demonstration on Saturday, Kings County
di>y, when the coming of the Valley road
will be celebrated in magnificent shape.
People from all over the surrounding
country will flock into the city. A special
train will carry without charge a tlirong
of invited guests from Stockton, Fresno
and way stations. It will be an epoch
marker in this county.
MAKING LINCOLN PRESENTABLE.
Mrs. Lincoln "Fixed V\t" tin. President-
Klect to Meet a Delegation.
In narraiing "When Lincoln Was First
Inaugurated," in tbe Ladies' Horae Jour
nal, Stephen Fiske writes interestingly of
tbe memorable tourney from Springfield,
111., to tbe National capital, and tells of
Mrs. Lincoln's efforts to have her hns
band look presentable when receiving a
delegation that was to greet tbem upon
reaching New York City.
"The train stopped," writes Mr. Fiske,
"and through tne windows immense
crowds could be seen. The cheering
urowned the blowing off steam of the loco
motive. Then Mrs. Lincoln opened her
handbag ana said:
" 'Abraham. I must fix you up a bit for
the<*<* city folks.'
"Mr. Lincoln gently lifted her upon the
i seat before him; she parted, combed ana
brushed his hair and arranged his black
: necktie.
"'Do I look nice now, mother?' he af
fectionately askad.
â¢â¦â¢Well, you'll do, Abraham,' replied
Mrs. Lincoln critically. So he kissed her
and lifteu her down from the seat, and
turned to meet Mayor Wood, courtly and
suave, and to have his hand shaken by the
other New York official-."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 20, 1897.
GOES FORTH FROM
PRISON A PAUPER
Ex-Millionaire Finigan
Released From the
Marin Jail.
Given His Freedom Pending
the Insolvency Proceedings
in Court.
Triumphs Over His Wife's Attor
neys After Passing Six Weeks
In a Dreary Cell.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., May 19. â Mrs.
Emily B. Finigan is not in possession of
the $1050 ordered by Superior Judge P, M.
Angellotti to be paid to ber, yet her hus
band who has been confined in the County
Jail of Marin for six weeks and one day
for not drawing a check in that sum to
her credit walked forth from his cell to
day a free man and a pauper.
It was 11 o'clock to-day before the at
torneys for Colonel Finicjan came into
court to ask for the release of their client.
While the case was proceeding Colonel
Finigan was still locked in the ladies' cell
in the basement of the Court-house. At
torney Sweeney read the order reciting
the fact that Colonel Finigan baa pre
sented his sworn petition that he was in
solvent and unable to comply with ihe
court's order to pay Mrs. Finigan the ali
mony demanded.
Judge Angellotti Baid that the question
was a new one to the courts of California
and that he could find no California Su
preme Court decision on this point where
the debtor filed his petition in insolvency
ana turned all his property over to the
Sheriff. The Judge stated that he would
release Colonel Finiean pending tbe in
so Ivency proceedings. So there is" a string
attached to Colonel Finigan's liberty.
There was an interesting scene in
Colonel Finigan's ccli when he was re
leased. His daughter, his attorneys, the
Sheriff and a number of newspaper men
were present to bid the prisoner
godspeed, Ke shook hands with his
friends and walked about as happy as a
schoolboy witn a new toy. There was a
bunch of roses on the tabie in his cell, and
while the sun beat down unmercifully
upon the heads of those outside, the cell
where Colonel Finisan had passed six
weeks of liis 1 fewas as cool and pleasant
a spot as one could find.
"I suppose we will have toput a 'to-let'
sign on the door," said he' and smiled.
"I'jl have to leave my picture gallery,
too," be continued as he looked at the
cartoons and coiorpd engravings from the
comic papers which adorned his wall.
The co:onel was not in a hurry to leave,
and be lingered in the orison for ttorae
time. Then he said good-by and thanked
his jailers for tbe kind treatment he had
rect'ived.
Next Monday an assignee will be ap
pointed to latce charge of the affairs of
Colonel Finigan.
TELEGRAPHY WITHOUT WIRES.
Authoritative Account of a Simple and
Important Invention.
W. H. Preece, the telegraphic expert of
the postollice, nad a surprise in store for
his audience at Toynbee Hall on Saturday
night, when he lectured on "Telegraphy
Without Wires," says the London
Cliroiiii'lo. There is, o! course, nothing
new In the fact of being able to com
municate without wires, but toward the
close of nis lecture Mr. Preece announced
ttiat a new invention, which might have
the widest possiDle influence not only on
the future of telegraphy, but on the safe
navigation of ships, had lately been
brought before the department, and no
expense would be snared to test it. Mr.
Marconi, a young Italian e!ectric:an, came
to him recently, he said, with a system of
telegraphy without wires, depending not
on electro-magnetic but on electrostatic
effects â that is to say on electric waves
set up of n much higher rate of vibra
tion, 250.000,000 a second i:. fact.
These vibrations were projected through
space in straight lives, and could be re
flected and refracted like lightâ indeed,
they were capable of ail the phe
nomena which light was allowed logo
through. The inventionâ which dealt
with the method of receiving and sending
messages by this meaus â was tirst experi
mented with on the roof of the postofflce,
ami then for three-quarters of a mil* on
Salisbury Plain. Mr. Marconi was pres
ent that night, and this was the first occa
sion on which the apparatus had been
shown, except to Government officials.
The great difference between the system
which had already been tried and Mr.
Marconi's system was that in the former a
wire on each side was necessary ana in
the latter no wire was required. Vibra
tions were simply set up by one apparatus
and received by the other, the secret being
that the receiver must respond to the
number of vibrations of the sender.
The apparatus was then exhibited.
What appeared to be just two ordinary
boxes were stationed at each end of the
mom, the current wa3 set in motion at
one and a beli was immediately rang in
the other. "To sbow tnat tbere was no
deception" Mr. Marcoui held the receiver
and carried it about, the beli ringing
whenever the vibrations at the other box
were set up. Continuing, Mr. Preece said
he had had the greatest possible pleasure
in telling Mr. Marconi that day that the
postoffice had deciaed to spare no expense
in experimenting with his apparatus and
one of the first trials would be from
Penarth to an island in the channel. He
might add that he had the greatest faith
in the apparatus. The curious thing
about it was that there was no new prin
ciple introduced.
The first man who taueht us how to
generate these waves was Hertz, the Ger
man physicist, and they had been
developed by others. But in marine prac
tical use of these waves Mr. Marconi had
invented devices which were highly novel
and very beautiful, and when they were
patented and could be made public he
thought they would be admired by every
body. Lord Kelvin it was who dubbed the
apparatus first used for sotting up these
vibrations '"the electric eye," and in this
connection he mi.ht say mat there had
been a great deal of nonsense written about
Professor Bose, who, beyond experiment
ing on these waves, had uonc nothing. He
ventured to say that the subject was not
only interesting in itself, but if trie ex
periments were successfulâ as he believed
they wouM beâ it would be of inestimable
value to our ships, for it would provide
another easy way of communicating with
lightships and iighthouses.
To take an instance: Since last year
they had nad a cable with the Fastnet
light, the first light seen by Ailantic
voyager.-, but in the early part of this
year it broke down, anil they had never
been able yet to land on the rock in ordtr
to repair ii. But there was a possibility
beyond this ct enabling ships as they
came near dangerous rocfcs and mallows
to receive an intimation of the fact by
these electric waves. Neither day nor
night made any difference, fog nor rain
nor snow would not interfere with thorn,
and if the invention was what ne believed
it to be our mariners would nave been
civen a new sense and n new triend,
which would make navigation infinitely
easier and safer than it now was.
MADEID SOCIETY TO-DAY.
Kven in. the Distress of War-Time Span
ish Gayety Goes On in the Old Way.
The Queen Regent of Spain, appears
nowhere in public at present except dur
ing her Saturday drive to a church where,
according to ancient custom, the sovereign
of Spain goes weekly, to pray â his
mamma with himâ so that the public sees
them en route. The church, by the way.
like all the churches in Madrid, is very
ugly and very gorqeons.-not'like the noble
catnedralg of other Spanish cities. The
Infanta Isabella, aunt of the Kin;?, drives
daily in tnc park, the Buon Retiro. eoes to
the Royal Theaier, and in general does
what sne can to re.-erve tue look of
gayety which Madrid still wears under
the shadow ol war. _ v .
"Everything rpanish is for the Span
iards?." This favorite adage of the Cas
tiiians is in especial force and favor at
Madrid at this moment. No European
capital is less cosmopolitan tlian the
capital of Spain. The Spanish dishk- of
foreigners is an ingrained thing, althoiuh.
until the present state of strained rela
tions between Spain and Jhe United
States, the Spaniards in general snowed
more liking for our compatriots than for
any Europeans. The distance and the
freedom of these "Estados Unidos"
aftVci the popular Spanish imagination,
and .Americans traveling in the Iberian
Peninsula have fouud a quick relaxation
of manner on the part of Spaniards on
first learning that they were "not English
English," but "Americans speaking Eng
lish, " a relaxing followed o.ten by cor
diality.
Americans resident in Spain have also
come to know Spanish Lome life better
than other foreigners, even in Madrid. In
the southern tnwns in Audaiusia, particu
larly in Granada, the cordialky of the peo
ple has been heightened by a mutual in
terest in the American whose namo is now
perpetuated in a hotel on AlbambraHill.
To be sure, the uneducated in Granada
look upon tho memory of Washington
Irvine as more or less associated with
that of the Moors, in whose old palace he
dwelt; but, at all events, he was an
Amer.'can, and brines many of his coun
try folk with money to spend in the very
city when* Ferdinand and Isabella, who
discovered these Americans, lie entombed.
In Madrid there is a more active know
ledge of the need of connection with
modern life. But there also pride in a
glorious pust is much greater than wis
dom in present difficulties or courage for
tho future. A curious insistence upon
things Spanisn prevails, altboueh the
M;i(iiilene women get most of their ex
treme fashions from Paris, and the men
most of theirs from London.
But even now, in the distress of war
time, the especial gayt-ties of Spanish life
ro on in their usual distinctive fashion.

There are several wooden railways in
Canada and the United States. One of them
is in the province of Quebec and is thirty
miles long. The rails are of maple, four
by seven inches, and trains are run over
them with remarkable smoothness at the
rate of twenty-five mile an hour. This
is used for the transportation of timbsr,
and the rolling stock consists of one en
gine and twenty* five cars.
The natives of Gibraltar and also the
Moors across the strait have a tradition
that somewhere on the rock there exist?
a cavern whence a subterranean passage
leads under the Btrait to the mountains
on the other side. The existence of this
passage, they say, is known to the mon
keys, who regularly use it in passing from
one comment to the other.
GOLD-FINDERS`
BIG ASSEMBLY
California Will Be on Hand
at the Denver Gath
ering.
A New Agitation for a Cabinet
0 ficer Will Be Vigorously
Started There.
The Official Call for the First latei
national Gold-Mining Convention
Starts Activity Hire.
The International Gold Mining conven
tion, which will meet in Denver on July 7
for a three days' session, has at last
loomed ud in a definite way before the
mining interests of California. Tiie circu
lars of invitation from the executive com
mittee in charge have reached Secretary
Julian Sonntag of ihe California Miners'
Association, Governor Badd and commer
cial organizations.
Leading California mining men are dis
playing interest in the convention. This
will be the tirst general gathering of min
ing men ever held. Its originators and
promoter!", the commercial and mining
organizations of Denver, have called it
"international," and the mining countries
of British, Central and South America
are asked to join in, but for practical pur
poses it will be an American interstate af
fair.
This being tne first convention and a
now thing the programme and scope are
naturally somewhat inchoate. Probably
the biggest single thing taken up will be
the proposition to create a department of
mining in the Federal Government and a
Cabinet officer representing this vast in
terest. This idea was tirst given an im
petus by the California Miners' Associa
tion'with the vigorous cnanioionship of
The Call. The demand will be vigor
ously expressed by the convention and it
will undoubtedly be presented to the trans-
Mississippi Congress.
The Californians will actively urge this
proposition, and also the one for a revision
and extension of the Federal mining laws,
which the California Miners' Associa
tion took up a year ago. Uniformity ol
State legislation is another of Che many
definite things now in view. One of the
most important features will be a discus
sion and display of the best methods of
gold mining and gold saving.
California will be entit'ed to send an
army of delegates, and quite a number
will doubtless po. The Governor is to
name thirty, each county and each city
and each town is entitled to five, and so
is every chamber of commerce, miners'
organization aud commercial organiza
tion.
Upon receivinc tue ofiiciaf call yes
terday Secretary Sonntag at once wrote to
President J. H. Nftfi and a meeting of the
executive committee will be held in a few
days to take action looking to an active
and creditable participation from this
State. The call is iigned by Robert F.
Hunter, chairman of the executive com
mittee, and Irwin Mabon, secretary, and
contains a summary of the objects of the
convention.
Secretary Sonntag and others want a
large mineral exhibit sent from the min
ing bureau, but nothing in this direction
has been done. It remains, to be seen
how far California makers of mining
machinery will be inclined to sand ex
hibits. The time for preparation is very
short and the success of the convention
can now be only guess'd at in auvauce,
but the first one will doubiless be fol
lowed by other aud greater ones, and the
second one will probably be bed in San
Francisco.
FINGERS BEfORE PORKS.
Concerning the Origin of Spooim â Those
of the Thirteenth Century.
If you desire to know about the scarcity
of really reliable data on the history of
spoons, take down your handbooks and
encyclopedias and see if it doesn't take
you a long while to learn anything con
cerning their origin, "nativity," etc. In
fact, the antiquarians do not pretend to
give us anything of value in that line. It
is admitted tiiat they are "very ancient,"
but just exactly how old they are, and by
whom and where they were first used, are
points upon which we are left completely
in the dark. Creighton s^ys: "Spoons
must have been a very ancient invention,
for a Saxon spoon of perforated silver gilt,
ornamented with gems, was found in a
crave at S:\rre, Tuanet."
When forks were unicnown spoons
played a very important part at the tabie.
Spoons of the thirteenth century, and
even later, had handles terminating i>i a
knob, knot, acorn or other odd and cum
bersome devices. About the period of the
restoration, of which so much i* said in
English history, a great change was made
in the forms of spoons. In some of the
unique patterns the "spoon" patt was
divided into two, three, and even four
Darts, and even the handle always split
or twisted or turned up, instead of down
ana back. Spoons of that period wore all
blunt, instead of being pointed, as in the
forms generally seen at present. They
continued short and blunt down to the
time of George 1, when they were first
made pointet and had the handles turned
down instead of up.
About the year 1500 what were known
as "apostle spoons" were introduced.
They were so called because they had the
figures of the twelve apostles carved upon
their handles. They were generally given
by sponsors to children at their time of
baptism. The wealthy presented the en
tire twelve â those who could not afford to
indu't-e in such extravagance giving one
or more, according as they felt able.
The most curious and remarkable spoon
in the world, perhaps, is a ''coronation
spoon,' 1 preserved among the other royal
relics in ihe Tower of London. The bowl
is of gold and the handle ot silver. The
handle is split down the middle and set
with all kinds of rrecons stonea. The
relic iÂ« valued at about Â£20,000, or upward
or $100,000.â St. Louis Republic

VTL MILES MEDICAL CO., Elkhart, Ind,
Home Journal. The article !Â» unique as
being the first written by a President or
life in the White House, and in descnoine
the routine of a Chief Executive. A
feature that he treats with directness
relates to the Presidents interruptions
from callers and office-seekers. "It. is
a rare iood fortune," he write?, "during
the early months of an administration if
the President gets one wholly uninter
rupted hour at his desk each day. Ihe
President's time is so Broken into bits
that he is often driven to late nighi work,
or to set up a UesK in his bedroom when
preparing a message or other papers re
quiring unbroken attention.
"Thoughtlessness is the root of all this.
'I only want five minutes'; and if he were
the only one it could be spar d ; but his
double is at his heels, and the urgent puo
lic business is postponed or done at night
with a jaded mind. It may be said that
untimely visitors should be excluded, and
so they should; Out thouuhtfulness on
their part would be a cure without a
smart." Regarding the office-seekers'
persistency in having personal interviews
with tiie President, General Harrison
asserts that they advance their cause but
little if at all. "But the feeline that
something: is or may be gained by a per
sonal interview prevails, and for the first
year and a half of an administration the
President spends from four to six houra
of each day talking about things he will
not have to act upon for months, while
the things that ought to be done presently
are hurtfully postponed.
"If the President could make up and
publish an appointment doctat and notify
all persons having anything to say in a
Darticaltjr case to 'draw near' on a fixed
day, it wonld result in a great saving of |
time all around, and a great saving of
money to the applicants, who could re
main at home until summoned to appear.
No papers should appear after the sub
mission of the case, and motions for a re
hearing and for a new trial should be
barred."

3 THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALLGIBSON`S
SKIRTS ARE
UNSMIRCHED
Chief Lees Exposes Another
Fake Durrant
Story.
ITS AUTHOR IS A MRS.
SCHWAITZER
Her Tale Sought to Involve the
Pastor of Emmanuel
Church.
POSITIVE PEOOF OF ITS "UTTER
UNRELIABILITY.
It Would Seem That Attorney Tubb's
Mouth Has B:en Copyrighted
b/ " The Examiner."
At deliberate a fake as was ever foisted
upon the readers of a newepaper was that
published in the Examiner, purporting to
be the discovery ot an important new wit
ness in connection with the Emmanuel
Baptist Church tragedies. The "gold
brick" yarn is briefly and bpst told in the
opening sentences of the Examiner's ar
ticle:
"A very important witness in the Min
nie Williams case was discovered yester
day in Mrs. Schwaitzer. She positively
affirms that on April 12, 1895, the day be
fore the body of Minnie Williams was
found in the Emmanuel Baptist Church,
she saw the unfortunate girl with the Rev.
J. Georpe Gibson on the Alameda ferry
boat coming to this City."
After giving what is alleged to be the
newly discovered witness' reasons for not
having made her Knowledge public earlier
the fake article says:
â¢The information came to the knowl
edge of the Chief of Police and yesterday
he summoned Mrs. Scnwaitzer and Dr.
G.bson before him."
Then, pretending to describe the identi
fication of Gibson by Mrs. Schwaitzer in
the presence of Chief Lees the story con
tinue.-:
"Ye?," she said, pointing to Dr. Gibson,
"I know that man; I saw him on the
Aianieda boat with Minnie Williams on
April 12, 1895. That is the man."
Notwithstanding that ail this appar
ently most important testimony is given
with the utmost positiveness, it is known
that it was published on the unsupported
recital of Mrs. Schwaitzer, though there
was ample time to confirm or contradict
the startling statements made by the long
â¢ lient witness.
Cnie.t Lees, in most emphatic words and
manner, pronounced the whole story a
concoction, without a fiber of lact in it.
In tne first place Chief Lees denied that
he bad sent for the woman, and declares
that the came to bis office of her own ac
coid Tuesday afternoon to tell her story.
He added that she was examined by him
for five hours in relation to what she
claimed to have seen on April 12, 1c95,
and made so many contradictory state
ments to well-established facts that he
had no doubt that her taie was unworthy
of a moment's credence. When she Jeit
yhe promised to return to the Chief's
ollice at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, but
f*iied to put in an appearance at any time
during the day.
Captain Lees further stated that the
Examiner had had no communication
with him whatever relative lo the woman's
s-tory before it was published, though Mrs.
Schwaiizer left his office shortly alter 6
p m., and he was in his ififice until 11 p. m.
}le also remarked while speaking of tlie
latest product of the freak enterprise of
the Examiner: "My opinion is tnat the
whole story was sei up in type at the time
this woman was talking to me."
During her long interview with Chief
Ivees Mrs. SchwÂ«itzer made a statement
that w ai so at variance with iacts previous
ly established beyond a shadow ol doubt
that he was constrained to look upon her
story as being manuiactured simply for
the purpose of distracting GovernorjUudd
and influencing the latter in his considera
tion ol the appeal recently made for cletn-
ency.
Alter Mrs. Schwaitzer took her depart
ure from Chief Lees' office Tuesday Detec
tive Seymour displayed his astutem-ss by
offer.ntt to wager with his superior that
her fako story would appear in the Exam
iner the next morning.
Mrs. Schwai'.zer's story as told to Chief
Lees C3mprises about 5000 words, aad was
taken down in snortliana at the time.
She stated that she became acquainted
with Minnie Williams in January, 1895.
Ai that time Miss Williams came to her
houie to buy some "packages of things."
iSbe afterward visited Miss Williamson
business at the latter' s home at Mrs. Mor
gan's in Alameda. She called at Mrs.
Morgan's on April 12, 1895, to see Miss
Williams, and the door wus opened by an
obi woman. M:s< William* was nor at
home. Later in the day she saw Miss
Williams on the Alameda boat bound for
ban Francisco in company with a man
â whom she described as follows:
"I should judge fie was a man who
looked between 30 and 35â may be 40. He
was a tail m: n. He bad on dark clothes
and gloves and carried his overcoat on his
arm. He had n lelescope basket in his
hand, which he carried lor her. He took
off one of his gioves and wore a piain
ring on his Jittle linger, and he had three
little scars on liis neck. I thought he was
a bad man. He was more tlian medium
t-zs; a little taller than you (Chief L?es)â
cb>ut 5 feet 11 inches, I should jud^e.
When he was speaking I noticed Le bad
lone, slim finger*.''
Then, in what Chief Lees declares was
r.n attempt io injure the reputation of the
dead girl, Mrs. Schwaiizer stated that Mmi
i â  Willams confided io her a story to the
effect that t-he (Minnie) had been secretly
married to a man in high position.
Continuing, she said that Miss Williams
r.nd the gentleman with her took the
Valencia-street car.
During tne preliminary hearing of the
Williams caÂ»e it was shown that Durrant
and the ill-fated g*ri took a Howard-street
car.
Further along Mr.'. Schwaitzer, referring
to the gentleman who she declared accom
panied Minnie Williams on the boat.
h& d : "The man had a strange little mo
tion with his head and a very pleasant
way of smiling, and I would know him in
a thousand ll ever I should see him again."
In relat.ng her personal histoiy shesaid
that at ibis time she worked lor a medi
<me company, selling a "female remedy
in capsules, it ionic for young girls." Her
business with Minnie Williams was to sell
her these.
Among the retsonssbe ascribed for not
conveying her information earlier to the
authorities or to Durrant's parents and
friends was her aversion to newspaper no
toriety. Yet she first poured her peculiar
story into the ears of an Examiner re
porier before visiting Chief Lees, fearing
evidently that the latter would effectually
protect her from "nevspnper notoriety."
The story came to the Durrants, she be
lieved, through Harry Morse, who Heard
it iroiu Mrs. Thrasher, to whom 6he had
told it.
Making another attempt to describe the
man who she said was with Minnie
Williamson the boat, she stated: "His
hair wa~ ruixea with irray. He was a nice
looking man and looket like some profes
sional man. His hair looked like a dirty
reddish brown originally. Had a peculiar
smile."
As a matter of fret Dr. Gibson's hair is
biack and curly and without a trace of
gray.
When questioned relative to herself she
positively declined to give her maiden
name, but admitted t hat she had been em
ployed as a "spotter" for the railroad com
pany.
At on<> time she casually stated that
Minnie Wiiliains had told her something
ai out Blanche Lamont, but when askei
to tell what this was, she re used to say.
She hnaliy said she wanted 10 consult
some memorandum first and woull re
turn on the morrow to unburden herself
of the secret, but her to-morrow is yet to
come.
Shortly before the interview concluded
Chief Lees called the following KÂ«"ntlemen
into his office: Capta n Bohen, Detective
Byram, Sergeant Moffltt, Officer Me-
Laughhn and Dr. Gilson, who had teen
previously telephoned for. He as*e<! Mrs.
Schwui;z?r if any of these gentlemen
looked like the man s-he saw on the boat.
She looked at them all and picked out
Dr. Gibson as the man who said looked
like the one she saw on the boat, but she
would not say that it was he. Her selec
tion was due, it is claimed, to the
that showed on Gitson's neck, and to
which reference has been made in the pub
lished accounts of the various Jepal pro
ceeding?.
Any one who has ever seen Dr. Gibson
w 11 readily notice that Mrs. Schwauzsr s
description of him was widely at variance
with the facts, so far as height and hair
are concerned.
Her most conspicuous departure from
fact is, however, recorded in the following
assertion :
"1 went about a year ago to Morgan's.
The same old lady came to the door, and
1 spoke to her about Minnie, and she said
the poor Ifctle child had pone away. This
ms preity near a year agoâabout May,
1896. The old lady "recognized me."
As a matter of fact on the very day that
Minnie Williams was murdered the Mor
gans were preparing to move into the
State of Washington and did so shortly
after.
Apart from the intrinsic evidence that
Mrs. Schwa tzÂ»r's long-deferred and prcu-
Jinr statemeni bears of being unworthy of
creden>e, according to the opinion of
Chief LÂ»es ttiere is other evidence to prove
that the man assertion of her storyâ the
t>res?nce of a gentleman, prejumaoly Rev.
J. George Gibson, on the boat with Minnie
Williams â is false.
Before Pastor Gibson left Chief Lees'
office on Tuesday the latter asked him to
forward a statement of his movement! on
April 12, 1895. This was received by Chief
Lees yesterday. It reads as follow^:
'Firstâ At the church about 9 o'clock
A. M. ,
"Secondâ At the Yuunp Men's Chris
tian A-sociaiion meeting, listening to the
Rev. Henry Varley.
"Thirdâ Met George King and Mr.
Worth, our organist, as 1 was leaving the
church.
"Fourthâ l went off wifh them for a few
minutes' conversation with iheru.
"Fifthâ l got Innch at Ruten's restau
rant, almoÂ«t opposite where i room.
"S:xthâ Went to my room and rested
till supper.
"Seventhâ Got supper at the same place.
Left about 6 p. m.
"Eighthâ Went from the restaurant to
the church. Left the church at 7:30.
"Ninthâ l arrived at Dr. Vogel's about
7:35.
â¢â¢Tenthâ Left Dr. Vogel's at 11:15 P. M.
"Eleventh â Three youne people saw me
home from the Christian Endeavor meet
ing at Dr. Vogel's at 11:15 p. M.
â¢ Twelfthâ The landlady heard me pass
into my room.
"Thirteenth â The landlord saw me
! come out about 7 o'clock in the morning.
[See Call of April 15, 1895]
â¢I wriie this in a big hurry and hope it
j is what yon want."
This history of the day as spent by Gib
| son is verified by the testimony of others.
It was also shown during the hearing of
the Minnie Williams cane that it was a
few minuses of 8 o'clock when the girl
! left the home of Mrs. A. D. Voy, where
j she had gone after coming to this side
from Alarneda on the fatal 12th of Apiil
to go to the meeting at Dr. Vogel's. And
the fact of Dr. Gibson's arrival at Vogel's
I Jong before that time is positively testified
I to by a number of people. This is pointed
to es being conclusive of Gibson having
nothing to do with the killing of the
young girl.
But there is reliable evidence in the
hands of Chief Lees to absolutely dis
i orove the assertion that Minnie Williams
I was accompanied by a gentleman on the
boat while coming from Alameda.
Three persons are ready to testify to
this fact. They have not heretofore
figured in the case at all.
One of these is Mrs. Witty, whose hus
band kept a barber-shop near Gobey's
sa loop-
She ?aid that she came over on the
evening of the 12th of April, 1895, on the
| boat with the Williams girl. She said
! what attracted her to the girl was that
i ."he had a lot of beautiful flower?. Mrs.
Witty looked at the flowers all the way
coming over.
When the Williams girl came off the
boat Mrs. Witty kept next to her all the
| why out and kept looking at the flowers.
There was a young man, Bmall-siz?d.
' like Durrant, who seemed to be waiting
! for Miss Williams, and as the girl got off
j the boat he stepped up and took off bis
1 hat and paused an instant, after which
I they walked off talking. Mrs. Witty
i turned to the right, they turned to the
left. Mrs. Witty still followed the flow
ers and saw the young man and Miss
Williams talking and walking toward
tne Howard-street turn-table.
The two other witnesses who will testify
when called upon to do so that no one ac
companied Miss Williams to this City are
a Mr. Harris and his wife, who also came
over on the boat witn the young lady.
Detective Harry N. Morse stated that
Mr-. Schwaiizer told her tale to him some
two years Â«go. His reason for not divulg
ing it wa-< because it referred to the Mi:i
r.ie William* case and had nothing to do
with the Limont case for which Durrant
wah undergoing trial.
Morse made an insinuation against the
methods of the police in the matter, and
said that when the schoolgirls were asked
to identify Durrant he was brought into
the room alone, while Mrs. Schwaiizer was
asked io pick GiDson out of five men.
Attorney George A. A. Tnbb, when
j asked why he put so pointed a question
i to Clarence W r olf about the thousand
lilies, replied :
"because I believe that right there lies
th" base of the whole mystery."
In his desperate endeavor to win fame
or notoriety in the case, Tubb, pernans
fearing that not enough shadow could bs
cast on Pastor Gibson to pain a commuta
tion o." sentence, has snen E mer Wolf
and secured from him a type-written
statement comprising twelve "or fifteen
pages explaining his whereabouts on
April 3 and April 12.
As Wolf has seventy witnesses to ac
count for bis whereabouts on the former
date anil thirty-six for the latter, Tubb
may conclude to drop him. The police
JjHve had a similar statement for some
time, but have not made its contents pub
lic because they saw plainly that Wolf
had no connection with the casa in a crim
inal way.
Mrs. Schwnitzer stated yest-rday that
TThat she had ?aid was true. Site reit

WASHED BY AN EMPEROS.
Francis Joseph Bathes the Feet of
Twelve Old Men.
Recently Emperor Francis Josepn, as
usual on Holy Thursday, washed the feet
of twelve old men who dined at the Berg
palace in Vienna. There were present,
says our* correspondent, ten archdukes be
sides the Emperor to remove the dishes,
which his Majesty himself placed on the
prettily decorated table, only one side of
wnich was occupied. The whole cere
mony, at which the diplomatic corps,
Hugh McDonnell and His Bride.
pious ladies of the nobility and such of
the public as had obtained tickets were
present, is performed with military pre
cision. When the dinner is over and the
table removed a long white cloth is laid
over the twelve old men's knees, their
feet are bared, and while the court chap
lain reads ti.e chapter of the day in Latin,
the Emperor, attended by two prelates,
who carry a golden ewer and basin, pre
pares for the sacred ceremony. At the
word?. "Et coepit lavare pedes discipu
lorum," he kneels down before the oiliest
of the old men t who sits first in the row,
and when the prelate has poured water
over his feet the Emperor dries them.
He then advances on his knees to the
second old man, repeats the action, and so
on to the end. When he rises to his feet
again he washes his hands, and then puts
me long string of a bag with thirty silver
pieces round each old man's neck. The
ceremony is then over, and the Emperor,
with his court, retires, while the withered
old men are taken to carriages waiting
fi r them by the stalwart soldiers of the
bodyguard.
Each of the Emperor's guests takes
away a large wooden bucket of old-fash
ioned shape, with all the dishes of the
dinner, tne mug, plate and jug. be-ides a
large pottle of exquisite wine. During the
dinner the dishes were not touched. The
twelve old women, whose feet the Em
press used to wash, do not now (says our
correspondent) come to the palase, but
have tneir presents s*nt to their homes.
The Empress lias not performed the cere
mony since 18S3. The Emperor, through
out his long reign, has shirked the duty
only once, in 1889. after his son's death.
Sir Horace and Lady Rumbold for the
first time attended this ceremony this
year, and seemed depply interested in it.
The French and Turkish Emba-sadors
were also present. â London Daily News.

Ctevelnnder Who Refuaed a Crown.
In bis account of the coronation at Mos
cow, in HarDer's for February, Richard
Harding Davis 'says there were enough
glories aDout Prince* and other prominent
people connected with the event to fill
many books. He adds: "More inter
esting to roe, perhaps, than all the
others was the little hereditary Prince
of the little rockbound principality of
Montenegro, which Mr. McGaban of
Cleveland, Ohio, helped give to one of
liia relatives; and without heeding the
Montenegrins' cry of 'Thou hast rid u^ of
kings, be tbou king,' went on to Con
stantinople, where he nursed a friend
out of a fever, and died of that same fever
at the age of 33. Mr. McGahan of Cleve
land, Ohio, the reporter who could have
been King had be wished it, lies buried
now on the hills above the Bosporus, and
Skobeleff and the officers of every ship of
war In the harbor stood beside the
grave when they buried him; and some
day his s ory will be told properly, and
Americans will visit his resting-place in
his home of exile. I saw several Princes
at the coronation who were waiiine for
<rowns; but I saw no Princa litse Mc-
Gahan, who had refused one."
BETSY BONAPARTE.
An Old Romance Revived by a Recent
Wedding.
Ninety-three years ago a small French
man-of-war, cruising about the North AtÂ«
lantic, fell in with an English frigate, and
ran lor shelter to the harbor ol New York.
Among the officers on board was Jerome
Bonaparte, the youngest brother of Napo
leon I, and while the British fleet lay off
Sandy Hook waiting for the Frenchman to
leave bis harbor of refuge young Bonaparte
made himself merry with his Yankee
friends and sympathizers, and fell in love
with Betsy Patterson, the youngest daugh
ter of a Baltimore merchant, who was
beautiful and bright and gay. His atten
tions were so ardent that M. Pichon, the
French Consul-General at New York,
thought it necessary to warn him that h;s
brother would not approve his roarriaee
with the daughter of an American mer
chant, and lie also notified Mr. Patterson
of the consequences that would likely fol
low such a match. But young Bonarart?
would heed no admonitions, and Mr. Pat
terson considered his daughter the equal
of her royal suitor, whose family had not
been many years upon tlie throne. The
marriage took place on Christmas day,
1803, the ceremony being performed by
Archbishop Carroll of the Catholicchurch.
The wrath of Napoleon soon burst upon
the youns coudlg. He ordered Jerome to
return to France forthwith, but forbade
the "young person," as he called his
brother's bride, to accompany him. All
Frencn vessels were forbidden to give her
transp'Ttation, and she was prohibited
from landing upon French soil.
For several months young Bonaparte
defied his brother, but finally saiied for
Europe, accompanied i>v his Uride. Being
forbidden to land in France, she went to
London, where she remained whi;e her
husband visited Paris in hopes of effect
ing a reconciliation. But Napoleon was
inexorable, and by a method which was
available to the royal families of that day
the Emperor declared a divorce, and pÂ«r
suadeii his brother to marry the Princess
Catherine of Wurtemberg. Napoleon
offered Betsey Bonaparte a large sum of
money and a pension if she would recog
nize the divorce and discard the name of
his family. But she declined to do so,
and her claims were the subject of long
and tedious diplomatic negotiations.
After parting !rora mm in London she
never saw her husband but once, and then
accidentally in a picture gallery in Wur
temberg, where she came face to face with
him and his new wile. There was no in
terview, but a natural recognition, and
Jerome remarked to Catherine, in a tone
that was heard by bystanders:
"That is my American wife."
A son was born to Bnsy Bonaparte
while she was waiting for justice in Lon
don. He grew to manhood, inherited the
property that had been bestowed upon
her and married Susau Williams, by whom
he bad two sons, Jerome and Charles.
The latter is a resident of Baltimore, a
most estimable citizen and quite active as
a reformer in political affairs. The
younger Jerome resides in Washington
and married Lou.se Edgar, a grand
daughter of Daniel Webster. His daugh
ter, Louise Eugenia Bonaparte, was
married the omer day at St. Paul's
Church in this city to Count Adam de
Moitke Huitteldtof Denmark, whose ac
quaintance she made in Paris, where
Count Moltke's fsther was for several
years the Danish Embassador. â Washing

MADE BY QUEEN BESS.
A Book Cover Kmbroidered by the
Royal Fingeia.
Why might not expert women â those
endowed with needle skill and good taste
try their bands at the embroidering of
book covers? Cyril Davenport shows in
the Portfolio the most noted of all em
broidered boot covers, the worK of Queen
E izabeth. The volume so decorateu was
Matthew Parker's "De Antiquitate Bri
tannicse Eccleaise, " and was possibly a
presentation coi>y from the author, who,
in 1572, was Archbishop of Canterbury.
The Queen chose a dark green velvet,
for green was a Tudor color, and Â«he em
broidered in gold. The design has its pe
culiarities. The idea conveyed is that of
a park, and the queen tries to indicate by
a wooden inclosure the name of the au
thor of the volume, Matthew Parker.
Decorations of book covers with what is
called In heraldry "a canting device" are
very old. There is a kind of paling run
ning round the four sides of the book
cover.
There are five deer, and the royal nee
dlewoman has made them all does. An
antlered stag the Queen did not fancy.
Ther* are two snakes, possibly a "noli me
tangere" whim of the great lady's. As for
flowers, there are many nondescript ones,
supposabiy heartsease, daisies and carna
tions. It is conventional work. One -leer
lias broken down the paling and the head
of the animal browsos through tha gap.
On the other side of the book thereare
four panels with the Tutior roses.
The embroidery was not the coup d'es
sai of the Queen's, for when she was 11
years old ?he worked a cover for a book.
'â¢The Miroir, or Glasse of the Synpeful
Soul," for Queen Catherine Parr. It is in
braid work of gold and silver, embroid
ered on blue silk. E izabeth's favorite
flower being the heartsease, she em
broidered four of these flowers at the
corners.
Queen Elizabeth may have been toward
the end of her life a hard old woman, but
she was a highly educated one, lor, when a
child, she had translated the "Miroir, or
GJasse," telling how she did it "out of
* renche ryme into Englis-h prose, joyning
the sentences together as well as the cap
acitie of my symple witte and small learn
ing coulde extends themselves." The
dedication is pretty. "To our most nob c
and virtuous quene Katherin, her humble
daughter wisueth perpetuall felicitie and
everlasting joye."
Elizabeth was better educated than most
women of tier day, and knew her Latin
and Greek, and had the faculty of noi for
getting. Hume says that on one occasion
the Polish Enibassador was apparently
wanting in respect to her; thereupon she
rated him in choice Latin, and when she
had finished she turned about to her cour
tiers and said : "S'death, .uy Lords (for
she whs addicted to swearing), I have been
obliged to scour un mv old Latin that hath
long lain rusting."â New York Times.
Six Kentucky MHrriagpg.
At the village of Roley one day not long

TEIED HIM TOE A MONTH.
Thomas A. Scott's First Employment by
the Pennsylvania Railroad.
In 1850 the Pennsylvania Railroad was
completed to Duncansville on the Alle
gheny Mountains, where connection was
made with the Portage Railroad over the
mountains. Chief Enprineer J. Ed ar
Thomson desired a capable man lor sta
tion agent at Duncansville and Dr. Given
of Columbia recommended Thomas A.
Scott, a younz man who formerly worked
for him. Mr. Thomson telegraphed to
Scott to see him in Harrisburg, . The
death of President Roberts prompts Mi
gargee to tell in the Philadelphia Times
the story of the first mee;ing ol Thomson
and Scoti, each of whom was afterward
pre-ident of the Pennsy.vania Railroad.
Thomson was sitting the next day in hia
office in Harrisburg when in walked a
visitor who was a picture of manly beauty
mid wore about him such a breezy air ot
independence as plainly indicated that
corporation chieftains had no terrors for
him. Hii l^ng yellow hair straggled over
his shoulders, a wide-brirom d slouch hat
was perched on the back of his head, his
pants were tucked in his boots and his
hands were exploring the very depths of
his pockets.
â¢â¢Young man, what do you want?" in
quired Engineer Tuomson. looking around
and gazinc on tins picture.
"I believe you telegraphed for me," was
the response in a very clear but respect
ful tone, but with no appearance of em
barrassment.
"What is your name?"
"Thomas A. Scott."
"Are you the young man Dr. Given re
commended?"
'â¢Yes, sir,"
The chief engineer, after a long and
earnest scrutiny of the long hair, the big
bnt, the doot-ericasod pants and the
Docket-hidden hands, said suddenly and
brusquely, "I don't think you will suit
me."
"That doesn't make a darned bit of
difference," replied the fair young man
with tae golden locks, not one whit
abashed. "I made up my mind to come
down here anyway and try you for a
month and if I liked you to stay and it I
didn't I woind mighty soon tell you so.
G( od-day, sir."
"Hold on, there," called out Chief
Thomson as the young man was walking
from the floor, probably demonstrating
more quickness ot determination than be
ever afterward displayed. "Gome bac&
here. I gue.-Â»s 1 will try you for a month."
And he tried bun for many years after

How to Buy Shoes.
Dr. Samuel Appleton gives some rules
about loot wear which every person will
derive comfort in heeding: '
Never wear a shoe* that will not allow
the great toe to lie in a straight line.
' Never wear a shoe with a sole narrower
than the outline of the foot traced with a
Dcncil close under the round ed^e.
' Never weer a bboe that pinches the heel.
Never wear a shoe so lerge in the heel
that the foot is not kept in place.
Never wear a slioe tbnt has depressions
in any part of the sole todropany jointor
bearing below the level plane.
: Never wear a slioe with, the toe turning
up very much, as this causes the cords on
the upper part of the loot to contract.
Never wear a shoe that presses up into
the lioliow of the foot.
' Never have the top of the boots tight, as
it interferes with the action of tne calf
muscles, manes one walk badly and spoils
the shape ot the ankle.
Never come lrom high heels to low heels
at one jump.
Never wear one pair of shoes all the
time, unless obiigeu to do so. Two pairs
of boots rvorn a day at a time alternately
give more service and are much more
healthful., â :
; Never wear leather sole linings to stand
upon. White cotion drilling or linen is
m.icli better and more healthful
; Never wear a snort stocking," or one
which after bein^ washed is not, at l^ast,
one-half inch longer than the loot. , Bear
in mind that stockings, shrink. Be sure
thai"' they will allow your * toes to spread
out at extreme ends, as this keeps the
joints in place Â«nU' makes Â» strong and at
tractive foot. As to s-.iipe of stockings the
single digital or "one-toe stocking" is the
bent. . . .' . , . ;.-' . .- â . : â  . â , -
Never think that the feet will grow
large from wearing proper shoes. Pinch
ing and distorting makes them grow not
only large but uns.ghtly. A proper, nat
urai use of all the muscles makes them
compact and attractive. â Health Culture.

A DIGNIFIED EETOET.
How a Bootblack Called Down Pro
fessor Blaclcie.
B!akie often told "on himself" this
anecdo c, which seems to indicate that
personalities are not agreeable, even to
those who deserve criticism.
This genial old prjfesÂ«or used to form
a very picturesque feature in the Edin
burgh streets. He was a wiry old patri
arch, with handsome features and hair
falling in ringlets about his shoulders; no
one who had seen him could possibly for
get him.
One day he was accosted by a very dirty
little bootblack with his "Shine your
boots, sir?"
The professor was impressed by the
film messi ness of the boy's face.
"I don't want a shine, my lad," said he:
"but if you'll go and wash your face I'll
give you sixpence.''
"A" richt, sir," was the lad's reply.
Then he went over to a neighboring
fountain and made his ablutions. Re
turning, he held out his hands for the
money.
"Well, my lad," said the professor,
"you hare earned your sixpence. Here
it is."

Au Interesting' Brief.
Collectors of law literature who are in
search of that which is interesting as well
as instructive should procure from Messrs.
Alexander and Green a copy of their brief
in the horse and cow case of Gulliver vs.
Blauvelt, in which William C. Gulliver,
the well-known la wyer, recovered aver
dict of 1600 for injuries inflicted upon a
saddle horse by a cow said to belong to
the defendant, which was tethered by a
chain on a rural highway in New Jersey.
The author of this argument declares
therein that the "defendant is anxious to
have his cow take her place among the
immortals, along with the white heifer
10, beloved by the King of Gods and
harried by his queen, and the cow that
overleaped the moon (presumably in a 1
effort 10 join Taurus in Zodiac), and Mrs.
0 Leary's cow that is said to have over
turned the lamp anxl started the Chicago
fire." He also suggests that thedefendant
was jealous of Mr. Burgess' purple cow,
and quotes for the benefit of the court the
celebrated lines:
I never saw a purple cow,
I never bope to <cc one;
But I ran tell you anyhow
I'd ratber see than be one.
The horse that was hurt by the rival of
the pnrp'e cow was named Robin Hood.

Business Office Â« ill receive prompt attention.
NO EXTKA CHARGE.
The weather Is decidedly picnicky.
He that can get an outing has an
inning.
The gingerbread fete is over and now
the dogs come in to take the cake.
It would not be a bad idea to settle the
Cuban question ri?ht just to eive Europe
an object lesson in dealing with Crete.
The term "filibustering" is regarded in
the Senate as an impolite expression;
"temporary delay" is the proper phrase.
Senator Wellington met a Waterloo
when he struck Senator Mason in debate
on the Cuban question, but he didn't
win ii.
Senator Mason may not be able to make
the old fogies of the Bsnate go forward,
but he keeps waking them up and won't
let them sleep.
Tne Turk stopped his march on Athene
when the Czar showed his hand, but
whether he will retire or not depends on
the Kaiser's show down.
The Sultan is now in a position where
he can listen complacently while the
European concert talks without feeling
the slightest desire to interrupt it or bring
it to a close.
Senator Aldrirh conferred a favor by
letting us know of the opposition to the
duty on fruits and wine?, for we are now
aware that the attack is coming and we
can prepare to meet it.
The Mission Park movement continues
to move on at sufficient speed to engage
attention and keep the public interested.
Each successive meeting of the promoters
of the enterprise shows good work done
and good plans for more in the future.
Work on the new Federal building 1>
promised at an earlier date than waÂ« ex
pected last weelt, and those who have
been sneering at the movement in this
City to forward the enterprise will soon
have to force a smile and pretend they
1 kÂ« it.
We are told that Turkey stopped her
onward march because the Czar said so;
but all the same the fact is conspicuous
that she did not stop until she hart driven
the Greek troops completely out of Thes
saly and occupied at Dhomoko the strong
est fortress on ber old frontier.
Consul-General Lee reports that 800
American citizens are starving in Havana,
and still the Democrats of the House of
Representatives postpone a vote of money
for their relief in order to give Bailey of
Texas an opportunity to snow his skill in
performing parliamentary tricks.
Senator Hoar's reference during the
Cuban debate to the mosquito as an in
fect having "very much buzz and very
little sting" leads to the conclusion that
he is a very thick-skinned gentleman in
deed. To people of ordinary sensitive
ness the sting of a mosquito is extremely
hefty in comparison with the weight of
the animal.
it is about settled that the Tammany
Democracy in New York will join the
Bryan winp of the party and kick the cold
men out. In the meantime David Ban
nett Hill talks diligently of local issues
and tri^s to harmonize the factions on ft
platform which means nothing. It is a
good Fight as it stands, and the harder it
gets the belter it is.
Senator Hoar is reported to have said
he "would have free hides for New Ens
land shoe factories if he had to stay in
Washington until October," and if he
reailv si id it be should be assured there
are Western Senators who will have the
hide products of the cattle industry pro
lecteci if they have to itay in Washington
until November.
In order to accommodate the greater
number of delegates at the Postal Congress
at Washington the discussions are carried
on in French, which shows how much
benefit Franc* still retninn from tbe old
time power that enabled her to make her
language the one of universal use in the
diplomacy of nations. Tbe only tongue
that approaches a world language is that
of England, and yet to this day when in
ternational gatherings are held it is always
found that more members can SDeak
French than English. Thus custom lives
long after the cause which brought it into
existence has vanished from the world.
The managers of tbe jubilee parade in
London have decided that peers and mem
bers of Parliament must pay for teats on
the stands provided for them, and there
is naturally a howl. New York gave free
Beats to Congressmen and Governors on
Grant day, and the British dignitaries
think they should have as good treatment
as is accorded to similar folks in this
country. The howl, however, is not like
ly to have much effect. Whoever has a
feat must pay for it. London is not senti
mental in money matters, and ha* so
many Lords hanging around that she is
not going to do kowtow to them to the
extent J of letting them into her show as
deadheads.
TURKEY AND THE POWERS.
During a grave crisis in the affairs of
England, when a dangerous issue was
seriously menacing the Government, one
o' the wits of Parliament at that time ex
pressed the situation as it affected the
House of Commons in the quatrain which
has since become famous:
I hear a lion in the lobby roar:
Kay. Mr. speaker, shall we clo^e the door
.And keep him out, or sbali we let him In
And do our Desi to put him out again?
The powers of Europe have not profited
by the wit and wi-djm embodied in the
verse. Tliey heard the Turk roaring at
tne doors of Greece, Dut were not wise
enough to shut the door ana keep him
out. Believing that it would be of some
advantage to have the Greek* beaten and
subdued, they left the way open for the
Turk to enter, and are now confronted
with the serious problem of getting him
out again.
Although it is announced that the
march of the Turkish trc-ODS on Athens
was stopped because the Czar of Rus
sia made a vigorous protest, the fact
remains that E.I hem Pasha aid not check
the advance of nis troors until he had
driven the Greets completely out of Thes
saly, and, by the capture of D omoko, put
Turkey in possession of the strongholds of
her ancient frontier. It does not appear,
therefore, that the voice of the Czar was
decisive in the matter. The probability is
that the Turks went just as far as they in
tended to go, and have stopped because
they are satisfied with the position they
now occupy.
Lord Salisbury, in an address on Tues
day evening before the Junior Conserva
tive Club, declared the powers would never
allow Christian communities to pass from
Christian rulers and fall to the Sultan's
Government. That, he said, would be
something which the public opinion of
Europe would not tolerate.
There is something of encouragement in
Salisbury's words, but.unfortunately.it has
been clearly shown ever since the pre-ent
crisis in the Levant culminatel in war
that the wishes of Great Britain in the
matter count for little, and that the only
power which can be looked to for a settle
ment of the is-ue is the alliance of the
three emperors. This alliance mnv be
disinclined 10 permit the Turks to remain
in possession of Thessaly, but it remains
to be seen whether that disinclination is
sufficiently strong to impel them to make
war against Turkey if the Sultan would
refuse to abandon his conquest.
It is clear the situation lias not been
rendered in any less degree dangerous 10
the peace of Kurope by the success of the
Turks. It has simply jÂ»ut a new problem
in the place of the olrt one. It is not now
a question of liberating Crete but of liber
ating Thessaly, and the difficulty of the
powers is increased by the fact thai
Turkey is not now despondent as she was
when the Cretan troubles began, but is
erect, flushed with victory, confident in
her arms and apparently ready for nny
contest which Europe may impose upon
her.
SPEEDING THE WORK.
In Â»n interview with our Washington
correspondent on Tuesday the Supervis
ing Architect of the treasury sta'ed that
so far from ihere being any prospect of
further dela> in the construction of the
new Federal building, as was sneenngly
asserted by the Examiner, the plans and
specifications for the work are so far ad
vanced that they will be completed much
sooner than was thought. "When yon
were here last," said the architect to our
correspondent, "I thought they would be
ready in tnirty days, but I am told by the
engineers and draughtsmen that they will
be completed in about a week."
It is now the expectation ( f the treasury
officials to advertise for bids for the work
of excavation and laying the foundations
of the building in about two wesks. These
advertisements will run until nearly the
end of June, at which time contract will
be awarded and the work of construction
will immediately begin. These promises
are so definite in their nature there hardly
seems room for further doubt upon tho
subject.
We have virtually won the battle fora
ypsedy beginning of the work and may
now direct our energies to the end of ob
taining the use of Californian miterial
for the edifice. Nothing should be im
ported from the East which can be ob
tained in this State, tor we would lose a
large part of the benefits to be expected
from the construction of the building if
any great portion of the material used in
it were obtained from distant localities.
The Call directed attention some days
ago to a report from Washington that a
Now England company was endeavoring
to obtain the contract for furnishing stone
for the building and urged the commercial
and industrial bodies of the City to exert
their influence to defeat the scheme. It is
gratifying to note that a prompt response
was made by several of the most influen
tial organizUions in the City. The pro
test of our people against the u-e of East
ern stone has been sent to Washington
and will doubtless have due weight and in
fluence there. We must, however, keep
close watch on the business at this time.
The contracts will soon be let and now is
tbe time for action on our part if we ex
pect to obtain all the possible benefits
from them.
HEW YOBK POLITICS.
The incorporation of Greater New York,
which will go into effect the first of next
year, has keenly stimulated the politicians
of that city. The prize to be struggled for
at the elections, which occur this fall, is
one of the greatest in the Unitea States.
Greater New York will be as populous and
as rich as almoÂ»t any Stale in the Union,
and the patronage at the disposal of its
officials will be enormous. The municipal
struggles of the past will be almost as
nothing compared with that which will
engage the people of the combined city in
the contest to determine to what party or
set of men shall be entrusted tbe responsi
bility of beginning tht new government
and laving the foundations of its future
administration.
Under normal conditions Greater New
York will be a Democratic city. There is,
however, a large independent vote, and it
is believed thnt if this vote can be united
with the Republicans it will be possible to
attain a complete Republican victory this
fall. To that end Senator Flatt and the
abler leaders of the Republican party are
now directing their energies.
It happens, however, that among the
independents of New York there are a
large number of mugwumps who can
never combine with anybody unless they
are permitted to have their own way. It
is this rule or rain element among the so
called good citizens of Greater New York
that constitutes the danger at the present,
time, borne of the leader* of this party
seem determined to nominate a citizen*'
ticket separate from the Republican ticket,
although all the wiser leaders of the party
warn them that such a course would in
evitab y result in the triumph of Tam
many Democracy.
The issue is one of sufficient importance
to interest tlie whole country. II Tam
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, M\Y 20, 1897,
many obtains control of New York this
fall it will be able to exert a powerful in
fluence upon the Congressional elections
next year, and may possibly hold i;s
power long enough to affect the Presi
dential election of 1900. Thi? makes the
is^ue a matter of National concern. It is
to be hoped that sufficient pressure can
be brought upon the leaders of the so
called "good-citizens' movement" to in
duce them to combine with the Repub
licans. It is certainly to their interest to
do so. They cannot expect eond govern
ment from Tammany. They will be well
assured of it under a Republican admin
istration, and it would be a monstrous
folly for any number of men to set up a
third ticket and thus divide the vote of
(he better element and leave to Tammany
a virtual walkover.
LAND AND LABOR.
Now that the promoiors of the plan to
provide work for the unemployed by fur
nishing them means for obtaining land
on which they can work with profit to
themselves and eventually establish
homes, have an opportunity to obtain the
co-operation of so great a captain of indus
try as Claus Spreckels, the chaaces for
success are so greatly increased as to ren
der it well nigh assured. It seems that
nothing more is now needed than ordi
nary ragaci'y and energy to put the col
onization plan into operation and make
it a genuine triumph for humanity and in
dustry.
In the interview between Mr. Srrecfcels
and Major Winchell of the Salvation
Army, and ex-Mayor EUert, which was
publisbe I in The Call yesterday, Mr.
Spreckels exprensed a willingne-s to do
everything in his power to aid the pro
iect. He pointed oat that more than a
hundred families hive already been in
stalled on land whicn he owns and have
been provided with everything necessary
to enable them to cultivate their farms
with profit. There is room for many
more such families on land owned by Mr.
Spreckels, ami he specified that he would
soon have 600 acres in one tract and 6000
acres in another, well fitted for beet cul
ture, on which he would bo glad to estab
lish families, provided the men are indus
trious and really mean to work.
Mr. Spr3ckels is not the only man who
is willing to give aid to the project, nor
are hi-Â» lands the only tracts that have
been offered for settlement. It is stated
that since the scheme was ri'st advanced,
Major Winchell his been offered upward
of 300.000 acres in different parts of the
State. As it is the intention to assign
only ten acres to each family, this would
make room for homes for all industrious
unemployed in California.
Of course, the land is not everywhere
equally valuable and the inducements to
settlers are not in all cases equal to too?*
offered on the beet lands of Mr. Spreckels.
Nevertheless it is probable that there is
hardly a 10-acre tract in all that has been
offered out of which an industrious and
thrifty fami y could not make a good liv
ing and save money.
The plan is one of such importance it
will engage the attention of all who are
interested in the problem of the unem
ployed. In ordinary hands but little
would be expected from it; but when di
rected by an organization like that of the
Salvation Army, which has so frequently
proven its ability to manage men in large
masses, and aiael by such experienced
capitnhsts and business men as Mr.
Sprpckpls, the outlook iÂ«i sufficiently en
couraging to justify the most sanguine
expectations.
It is within the limits of probability
that we are on the verge of solving the
problem of the unemployed and the
proolem of big estates at the same time by
opening land to the landless and making
way for uomes for those who are now
homeless under conditions that promise
prosperity to all who industriously profit
by the opoortunitv offered.

status of fraternity, now work /or the com

Mrs. Marion J. Perry of Aiba Circle of Vallejo
read from manuscriptâ a roll 27 feot in
lengthâ a humorous skit In verse, but tbe
versification wan not a 8 long ns the paper on
which it was written would nave led tbe lis
teners to believe. It was a happy description
of ii de egate's visit to ihe previous convention
at Ukiab and of (hi sights and scenes there.
Tnere were some remarks by Mrs. Hulpru
ncr, supreme sub-chief companion, P. F. Mo
Nuity, apnst officer of the order, and John
Falconer, tbe .'ouuder of the order nn this

last named wat that the success of the order
depends upon the individual efforts of the
members to maintain its principles, n ihe
sinking of selfish ambition and in tbeicarry
mg out of tbe idea of ;he greatest good to the
greatest number. The convention was con
gratulated upon the good work thnt had been
done during tbe past year and upon the fact
tim i a c "riftin disturbing element bad been

but lour representatives of the uterner sex,
and tbe place was almost an Aiamless Eden in
winch tbe greatest harmony and good nature
prevailed, and as for merriment tnere was no
end to it while the company remained assem
bled there.
After an excellent menu bad been discuss ed
between tbe exchange of bon mod, anecdotes
and reco. lections ot the events of the conven
tions, past and irei-eni, the louiider of tie
order, Sir. Falconer, on behalf of the Supreme

ing, presented to Mrs. Minnie Asher. past su

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Frau Muterna will never sing in public again,
either in concert or opera. Gencrul regret is
expressed to the European papers at h^r
decision, which she declares is irrevocable, for
while Materna's grand voice is far from being
what It was in her zenith, she is a much more
flocomplished singer, from the standpoint of
vocal technique, than most oJ the younger
Wagnerian artists now before the public, and
she interprets the Bayreuth master's music
with an authority that no other living singer
cnn claim. She was Wagner's ideal primadouna
for his heavier female roles, and he himself
taught her exactly how he wished hia music to
be interpreted. rfaterna said farewell to the
operatic stage in Vienna in 1894, with the
intention of devoting herself to teaching and
concert work. About a year ago she received a
Government pension which made her inde
pendent, but she still continued teaching and
occasionally appearing In public. The other
day a grand banquet was tendered ncr by a
number of Viennese journalists and men of
letters. Materna made aspeech and astonished
the company by announcing her irrevocable
FRAU MATERNA, Who Will Never Sing in Public Again.
intention of disappearing entirely from pub'.ic
life. She concluded her address by reading
the admiring letters which Wagner wrote her
when she created his Brunehilde at Bayreuth
"Letters," said Materna, "which will always
remnin the most glorious and cherished
souvenir of my career."
Americans have heard so much during he
past winter about Jean de Reszke being the
one and only great operatic tenor to be pro
cured, even at a ruinous expenditure of Amer
ican dollars, that it ought to interest Amer
ican opera-lovers to see that Monsieur Jean's
nose is entirely put out of joint in Paris by an
Italian tenorâ none other than Tamagno, who
has been a good deal despised on this side of
the Atlantic since Jean's sway began. "Ta
magno is no artist," say Jean's American ad
mirers. "He has a phenomenal voice, a mere
accident of nature, but his art is conspicuous
by its absence." Well, Tamagno ha 9 just burst
upon Paris, and In a few representations has
j-ucceeded in discounting the popularity that
Jean has been laboriously building up for
years. In the first place he performed the
miracle of mating a national theater (the
Grand Opera-house) give Verdi's "Otello" In
Italian, which was a new departure, and
aroused all the French jlngoists aeainst himâ
before he sangâ for even the jitigolsts have
marshaled themselves under his banner now.
The enthusiasm over "Otello" Is said to have
reached tne delirium point, and President
Felix Faure terminated the gala performance
by decorating Tamagno. The criticisms are
unanimous in Tamagno's praise. Following
are a few random extracts: Le Petit Journalâ
"One must consider Tamagno as a prodigy of
nature." Le Journalâ "Tamagno defies criti
cism on account of the startling superiority
of hiÂ« tragic power and of his voice." LeGau
loisâ" â¢Otello' puts the genius ol its inter
preter side by side wlih the genius ol its crea
tor." And bo uu through the whole list of
papers.
Jean de Reszke. in spite of his superior fin
ish, never iv his best days had a phenomenal
voice, and considering the arrogant way in
which he has "bossed" American operatic
affairs for at least one season on iho strength
of his European reputation, it is pleasant to
find that Iv Paris, his very strongnold, Mon
sieur Jean is being made to find that he is
"not nil- oniy pebble on the botch," as they
say at the music halls.

Last Monday, the 17th, the summer season

Mme. Nordica has not succeeded in making
a very lasting Impression in Paris with her
Elsa in 'Lohengrin." This is an extract from
La Figaro's criticism: "Her appearances at
Bayreuth have given to her very exotic
tn'.ent the official and very serviceable stamp
which she was in want of before. The public
courteously received this artist, whose style,
warm, it is true, is lacking in sincerity and
simplicity; whose pronunciation is very de
fective, and whose voice, although pretty
when she sings softly, is not always in tune
when she sings with force."

News from Cape Town, as to the voyage
of the British ship BeJford from this port,

Macdonald yesterday. Both the medical

According to the letter received by Dr.
Hay, there was a mutiny aboard the
Behord on her trip to Cape Town and
seventeen of the mutineers were arrested
as soon as the vessel reached port.
When the Bellord left San Francisco
Captain McKinnon took along with him a

father was years ago one of the best
known physicians in San Francisco, and
when he died the mother in a measure

was brought to bear on Captain McKin

well with the men shipped in San Fran
csco. The latter objected to the airs he
put on and threw him out of the forecas
tle. The mate interfered, he wrote, and
the men threw the mate into the scupper.
Then the port watch struck work and the
ship was lett without a helmsman. When
she began to yaw the starboard watch was
called on, and many of these being old
sailors who had made several voyaces
with Captain McKinnoo, responded, and
the Beiford was again put. on her way.
In the meantime, the letter contin
ued, a free fight had been going
on among the men who stood by
the captain and mate and those who
thought Holland was not do;nca fair shure
of work. The captain and his men pained
the day, and when the vessel readied Cape
Town ail the mutineers were placed uuder
arr st.
Ttie Belford left here on January 7 last
with a cargo of wheat, barley and general
raprchamiise.
The <>teara schooner Lakme ran into
M.ssion-street wharf last Tuesday nij;ht.
A strong flood title was running and the
vessel became un man actable. The amount
of damage to both steamer and wharf will
not amount to more than $250.
The marines from the Bennington, Mon
terey, Monadnock and Alert were ashore
in a body yesterday and were drilied on
Lombard-street wharf. It is the first time
they have come toitet or, and the object
was to have them in readiness for the
Memorial-day exercises.
The British suip L;amore, Captain Fer
guson, will probably sail for Scotland to
morrow. She has on board the only cargo
if reawood lumber irom this port that has
ever gone to the Clyde. The ship is bound
for Gia-gow, and in order to bring her
down to the Piimsol mark a quantity of
lumber nas leen piled on her deck. The
L'smore is a smart ship, and Captain Fer
guson is confident thai he will be along
side the quays in Glasgow before vessels
that sail tor Liverpool days after him.
John Fox, one of the sweepers on the
water Iront, was given a reception yester
day. He got a duy off to no to Stockton
in order to vote the Democratic ticket dur
me the local election. He was on the
winning side, and when he returned to
duty yesterday the wharfingers and col
iectors from Main, Beale, Harrison and
Freemont street wnarves got together and
presented him with a magnlhcent iioral
wreath. The emblem was selected by
Wharfinger Deasy, and many of the flow
ers came from his own garden. Fox now
thinks that one of the greatest elections
in the country is the one in which ttie
unite I Republicans ana Democrats swept
San Joaquin County.

James A. Waymire returned to-night
unannounced Irom his Eastern journey
via Chicago, and shortly aiter his arrival
he was called upon by a representative
of The Call at his beautiful villa. Oak
Shale, on Buena Vista avenue, Alaraeda.
Mr. Waymire was not disposed, on account
of faticue and other reasons of policy, to
talk about matters political, though lie
admitted that ih* President Had made
him promises of political preferment
which are satisfactory to him.
"1 did not go East," said he, "to get an
office and did not expect anything when 1
went there. I did call on the President,
as the dispatches have said, and we talked
over political matters in California. The
President was kind enough to say ha in
tended to offer me suitable recognition
for what humble services 1 performed in
bit behalf and 1 have no doubt that in
tlie proper time something wiii be sug
gested by him that will be satisfactory to
me. Further than that I could not say
anything concerning ;he interviews I had
with him. Moat of my time was taken up
in New York on matters of private busi
ness in regard mostly to irrigation securi
ties and the result hat been more than
satisfactory.
"I iniirht add that whi'e I was in Wash
ington 1 did what 1 could to help in toe
award of official preferment to those that
I believed were deserving of It in Califor
nia and whom I felt under obligations to
for services to me during the last cam
paign."
Friends of Mr. Waymire who claim to
be in his contidence lnuniatea that the
President's promises assured Mr. Waymire
of his future appointment to the vacancy
on t c bench oi the United States District
Court by reason of the promotion of W.
W. Morrow to the Circuit Court bench,

YOUNG BARILLAS
HAS GONE HOME
Unfounded Report of His
Marriage on the
Vigilant.
M 33 Kate Eiosey Said to B 1
the Heroine of a Ro
manes.
Captain Selovich Denis That He
Joined the Couple in the Bends
of Matnimny.
An evening paper yesterday published
a statement to the effect that Jose I.
.barillas, nephew of the ex- President of
Guatemala, had hired a tug last Tuesday
which took him and Miss Kate Kinsey,
the 17-year-old daughter of C. C. Kinsey,
outside the nine-fathom buoy, where they
were united in the holy bonds of wedlock
by the captain.
The story goes that young Barillas, who
came to San Francisco a year aso at the
age of 17, fell in love with Miss Kinsey six
months ago. Owinc to the youth of both
parties Mr. and Mrs. Kinaey objected to
their daughter marrying the Guatemalan,
and when the younc man presented Miss
Kate with an $300 diamond ring as a
i >ken of their engagement her parents or
dered her to return the pledge. This she
refused to do and they did not insist.
Young Barillas left on the steamer City
of S\*dney last Tuesday on his way to
Guatemala to look after his estate there,
but, according to the story, he made Miss
Kinsey his wife the day before. This
is the way in which the incident is nar
rated in the evening paper:
On Monday he consulted his attorney and
the latter showed him the way to fool lock
smiths and parents. Arrangements were
made to charter the tug Vigilant, and at 4
o'clock on that afternoon tbe poweriul tow
boat (teamed out toward the heads with a
h.ippy party on bourd. When the tug returned
Don Jose Barillas and Mi>s Kate Kinsey were
man and wife. Tiie tugboat got back at 6
o'clock and youug Mrs. Barillas went to her
home, leaving the happiest man on earth on
the wharf.
Cnpuln Joh.n Selovich tied the knot, and he
made it as fast and .strong as any clergyman
could have done. Many a little ceremony
like this has the captain performed, but never
did he tie a knot that was so satisfactory to
him.
TLe fact is that the Vigilant did not go
out on Monday. Superintendent McCoy
denied last evening that the me went out
or that any couple was married on board.
Uaptain John Selovicn was equally em
phatic in his denial of the story. In bluff
sailor style he denounced it as "a blank
dashed lie.''
Charles C. Kinsey, the girl's father, was
seen last nigr.t by a Call reporter at the
residence, 610 Fillmore street. In an
swer to questions as to the truth of the
story, lie said:
"1 Dave no statement to make. I am
no* seeking notoriety."
That was all that he would say.
Inquiry along the water front aa to any
other tng having taken a young couple
outside the Heads was met with a reply in
the negative.
PADRUTT WILL MARRY.
Refused a I>icenÂ«e by Cupid Danforth,
the High Sea* Will Be Re
â¢ orted To.
Charles Padrutt and Mrs. Eliza Shilliger
are victims of the recently enacted law
that provides that divorced persons must
wait one year before again assuming the
bonds of matrimony. Padrutt applied a
few days ago for a license to marry Mrs.
Shilliger, but Cupid Danforth refused to
issue one because the lady had been
divorced but a few weeks.
The prospective groom then decided to
be .named by the skipper of a tug on the
high seas, but as the price asKed was a
little higher than be thought right the
wedding has been deferred until better
arm moments can be made,
Padrutt is a teamiter working for Hulse,
Bradford & Co., and his leilow-employes
have taken so much interest in his venture
on the sea of matrimony that they pro
pose to see that he is married even if it is
necessary to charter an ocean steamer in
order to get the knot tied.

HIS SKULL FRACTURED.
Michael Merkle, Â» Cook, Struck by s
Mission-Street Klectrlc
Car.
Michael Merkle, a cook living at 149
Erie street, had his skull badly fractured
last night by being knocked down by a
Mission-street electric car. w . v
He was riding on a car on his way home,
about 6:30 o'clock, and when he reached
Erie street he signaled to the conductor
to sop. As he stepped off a car going
rapidly in the opposite direction struck
Mm and the blow knocted him down,
fracturing his skull. He was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, and Drs. Thompson
and Hartley trephined the skull, taking a
big piece out of it. Although tbe iracturo
is serious, the doctors think he will re
cover.
George Geidner, Sixteenth and York
streets, was with Merkle on the car and
was to go home with him. Geidner was
just stepping off when the car struck
Merfcle.
"The car was going at a rapid rate,"
said Geidner last night, ''and it is n
wonder to me that Me rice was not killed.
I did not hear the bell ringing and I feel
sure the motor man did not ring it. I had
one foot on the ground when Merkie was
struck and felt no excited that I did not
take the number of the car."

DO FARMERS WANT
A FREE MARKET?
If So, Where and How Ar
ranged? Ask Harbor
Commissioners.
Adams of the Santa Cruz Mount
ains Said to Be the Father
of the Law
N:xt Thursday a Big Delegation of
Leaiinj Grangers Hay Teil tin
Board What Is Desired.
The Gtate Harbor Commissioners nnd
representatives of the State Grange,
Patrons of Husbandry, discussed the tub
ject of a iree market yesterday afternoon.
Commissioners Harney and Chad bourne
were tnere, but Mr. Colnon was absent
enjoying his vacation in Stockton.
A. T. Dewey was the first man to speak
for the farmers in support of the market
proposition, but he prefaced his remarks
with a suggestion that the Commissioners
adjourn the meeting nntil a larger repre
sentation of fruit-growers and Gransers
could be present. He desired that the
farmers representing the Grange should
co-operate with the fruit men from all sec
tions of the btate. He asked that a future
time be designated for the Harbor Com
missioners to meet the parties most inter
ested.
Commissioner Harney remarked that
within twenty days the fruit season would
be upon us. He thought if any steps were
taken this season the start shoull be made
at once.
Mr. Dewey said he suggested postpone
ment in order to get the views of a lull
delegation of farmers.
Commissioner Chadbourne asked if it
would not be possible to get the farmers
here some time next weekâ Thursday, for
instance.
Commissioner Hnrney asked Mr. Dewey
if it would not have been better if the in
terested parties had come before the
board immediately after the law was
pa-sed authorizing the Commissioners to
build the market.
â 'Are you a farmer?" ssÃed the Com
missioner, addressing Mr. Dewey.
Mr. Dewey replied that he was a farmer
of Tulare County, and, answering other
questions, suid that fruit would come from
Tn'are to San Francisco if a free market
were established here. Tins year or next
year the Cny should nave the market.
Mr. Dewey also admitted that farmers
did not as a rule more with tnat rapidity
with which business men acted. It was
not possible for them to gel together often
and consult.
Replying to questions propounded by
Major Harney, Mr. Dewey said he did not
k iow tne quantity of fruit and other per
ishable larrn product* that came to San
Francisco annually. He did not know
Htiat wiiarf space would be required; he
did not know whether the quantity was
50,000 tons or 100,000 tons.
When tne major had fully convinced
the audience ol interested commission
merchants that Granger Dewey was not
innateu with data, the major kindly
tapped bis own reservoir of statistical
knowledge, and told the Grangers thai the
quantity of fruit and perishable |<roducts
annually coming to ttiis port from the
f:i"in- of California hardly fell short of
200,000 tons.
'1 httv.! the figures; I got them my
self," continued Major Harney. "Whail
want to establish now is that dereliction
of duty in the building of the free market
cannot be charged to the Harbor Com
missioners. We nave had no a'ivice from
the men who procur*d the enactment of
the law. We Have not been able to ascer
tain what (he farmers want."
W. H. Murray was next called out He
suggested that it would oe wise to have a
meeting ten days hence to hear lrom the
interested farmers.
In the general discussion which followed
the statement was made by Mr. Murray
tnat Mr. Adams of the Santa Cruz Mount
ain? prepared the bill for the free market
which the Legislature passeu.
Comruisiouer Cuadbourne said that if
some one would come forward and father
the law the board might be able to ascer
tain what was de-ired. He aÂ«ked Mt.
Murray if the interested farmers and
fruit-growers could not meet here in ban
Francisco as early as nei week.
Commissioner Harney explained that
no wharf had a capacity exceeding 200J
tons. Five wharves at least would bo
necessary to supply the accommodation*
for fruit.
Mr. Murray said he would not for a
minute suggest a retail proposition on the
wharf. Packnges should not be broken on
the whan.
After further discussion it was agreed
to take up the suoject again at the meet
ing of the Commissioners one week from
to-day. ____^_^__^__

Bishop Nichols Extols Gocd Samari
tan Mission as th: Ideal
Cathedral Type.
The Bishop's annual address was de
livered at the Episcopal Convention yes
terday and the proceedings were+elso
fruitful in a discussion on home mission
work of considerable interest to Episco
palians and in the appointment of com
mittees and the discussion of things in
tne canons.
The first question discussed at the
morning session was a suggestion of tlie
Board of Missions that a standard of $5000
should be act as the annual contribution
of the diocese to the home missionary
field. Rev. Joha A. Emery, who pre
sented the suggestion, pointed out tnat
the proposed contribution was not to be
compulsory, but merely a standard.
Rev. Dr. Spalding said: "Xliis sueges
tion of liie Board oi Missions is the great
est step iorward in catholic lines that our
church has taken for years. For the first
time we formally recognize that every
purish and mission in this diocese has a
special obligation to spread the gospel."
Vincent Nea.e of San Rafael moved that
t. c standard be made $7000. Tbe general
discussion whicn ioliowea brougntout the
generally expressed sentiment that the
Episcopalians of the diocese need rousing
to the need of supporting home mission
work. Some of tbe speakers made touch
ing allusions to people in remote places in
the interior, waiting for a missionary to
baptize tueir children and administer
spiritual comfort to their dying.
At the sii^g Mion of Bishop Nichols,
who presided, some ot t c missionaries
irom the ban Jouquin Valley. were called
on to sneak to the point. Rev. L. C San
lurd, in charge of Hie missions at Setma
and Saniord, spoke of the sirugf les of his
missions to ba sell-supporting; Rsv. W.
M. Bouri of Merced anU Madera told of
the two handfuts of people who were al
most losing sight of the spiritual object of
the missions in the efforts to raise enough
to pay taxes and indebtedness, and Key.
C. S. Lnaey of Hantord told tne conven
tion tnat what the San Juaquin needed
was an archangel, "lor they live on
heavenly food and do not want appro
priations from the Board of Missions."
ile v. H. Lee oi Contra Costa County and
H. M. Nagle, a layman, who has built the
first churcu at Rands burg, also spoke to
lue need of a more generous standard.
Bishop Nichols made an earnest plea
for tne Boaru of Missions, saying: "Tue
board ha- a wide ana definite policy, not
only for the present but lor the future, a
policy embracing the establishment of
cuans of missions through the mining
camps, along the coast aud along tbe
routes of new railroaus. We have plans
to reacti the great San Joaquin Valley,
but one part of our plan is omy to put tne
best men in tue missionary neid." At tue
conclusion of the Bishop's address the
motion for a standard of $7000 was unani
mously carried.
Rev. A. H. Pnelps presented tbe claims
of the Epucopal cnurch organ, "The Pa
cific Cnurcnman," tue proprietor of
wuich, Mr. Onver, recently died. Mrs.
Eva R. Oliver, his widow, intends to
manage the paper herself, and Bishop
Nichols added a warm appeal for Mr.-.
Oliver to that presented by Mr. Fhelps.
Tne Bishop t>aid: "She has shown a
ready ability in taking the work of tne
paper DP, and a skill which we should
recognize and support."
Tbe afternoon session wae chiefly occu
pied with elections, which resulted as fol
lows:

Rev. Dr. B. Akerly was continued
registrar of the diocese by a rising vote.
The points of greatest interest touched
on in tue B shop's annual address vere
tm allusions to the hopes of a cathedral
for tins diocese, and ha plea to tne ciergy
to look in o and adopt a system ot bjto
tematic giving, now ill use 1:1 some of {he
paribht-s of Â»ne diocese. Speaking of ihe
cathedral scheme, be said: "ihe first
thing to be secured is a proper diocesan
status. The Guod Samaritan Mission lias
been faithfully fostered by the City Mis
sionary Auxiliary Board, and comes
peculiarly recommended as of tne proper
cathedral type. The germs of the true
cathedral typel:e in the Good baniaritan
Mission. VVe noue and Dray lor its
progress."
Tue final adjustment of the funds be
tween the diocese of California and tne
diocese of Ljs Angeles was announced,
and the Bisoop stated that it was time to

Episcopal Ministers Dine.
The annual dinner usually given at the
close of the meeting of the Episcopal
ministers of the coast took place last
night at the Occidental Hotel. Bishop
W. F. Nichols presided. There were
about forty ministers pre.-ent. The dinner
was given in the south part of the main
dining-room and was a very pleasant
affair. The ministers sat down before 7
o'clock and did not leave till nearly 11.
There were many interesting speeches. In
which experiences in church work in differ
ent parts of California ana elsewhere were
fiiven.
The Police Tribunal.
The Police Commissioners met last night
and were in a merciful mood, a charge of sit
ting down while on duly against Policeman
E. J. McNamara was dismissed. Henry A.
Madden was charged with assaulting a citizen
in a aaloon, but the evidence sbouci that the
assailant was Maddens brother, and me
charge irai dismissed.

CLINTON`S RATES
TO BE FOUGHT
Supervisors Think That
His Cut Is Altogether
Tco Big.
Disposed to Give the Water
Company a Fair Show in
the Matter.
Dr. Rottanz Win Present a Schedule
as a Substitute for That cf
Dr. Clintcn.
Supervisor Clinton, Boss Rainey's man
in the Board of Supervisors, will find it a
hard job to crowd his 20 per cent reduc
tion in water rntes down the throats of
his colleagues in office, and there is pros
pect of a hyely fight over the mailer at
the meeting to-nignt.
Quite a number of Supervisors think
that the cut is too Heavy and it will result
in a legal combat with the water com
pany that may prevent any reduction be
ing accomplished. They are in favor of a
fair reduction that will permit the cor
poration to pay reasonable dividends on
its stock, but object to any measure that
savors of a ''cinch."
Then, again, there are members of the
board who believe that Supervisor Clin
ton has usurped too much power ia the
matter, and that presuming on his posi
tion as chairman of the Committee ou
Water and Water Supp y he lias pone
ahead in the preparation of a schedule of
rates without consulting his colleagues or
allowing them to incorporate any of tiiier
ideas ia the measure that will be pre
sented to the board.
Supervisor Rottanzi says ilat he is ro
mp to have a say in the question of fixing
rates, and that when the board meets to
consider the question he will have a sched
ule that he will offer as a substitute for
that of Dr. Clinton. He has far more fol-
Jovinj; in the board than Dr. Clinton, and
expects to have his plan for a reduction
accented.
Dr. Rottanzi Is not shouting his figures
from the housetops, but says that they
are the result of much hard study and
consultation wi'h brother Supervisors.
"I am r.ot rushing into the newspapers
to tell what 1 am going to propose," he
said, "and it seems to me that such things
should be kept back until the proper time
arrive* to give them out, and that is when
the question comes regularly before the
board."
It is not irriDrobab'e that others beside
Dr. Rottanzi will offer suggestions and
perhaps complete schedules, and that the
matter will nit have been decided when
the meeting adjourns.
Nearly Â£500,000 worth of artificial
flmvers are iÂ»ld in London yenrly.

THEY ARE TRACINGS
The Expert Gives His Opin
ioa on the Deed
Signatures.
It Was Another Dull Session
of the Fair- Craven
TriaL
More r<e?at.ves and Enlarg.d PtiOiO- '
'graphs Are Added to the Already
Burdensome Pie of Exhibits.
The hot wave certainly had its effect
upon the Fair-Craven trial yesterday, for
a duller session has not yet characterized
this tedious anl iong-drawn-out proceed
â¢ing.
The morning opened with Photographer
Donovan bade again on tiie witness-stand.
He went througn the old ceremony ot
identifying negatives, coatact plates and
enlarged reproductions of James G. Fair's
signatureâ things that had been turned
â  cv: by his experienced bands and cam
eras. Then David Carvaiho, tue New
York handwriting expert, was recalled
and he kept the stand throughout the bal
ance of the day. He resumed his ar.al<r
sis of the deeds which convey to Mrs.
Nettie R. Graven two of the mostvalu3ble
., pieces oi property and again essayed to
pick them to pieces from the hard-writing
expert standpoint. It waa Jill for one pr.r
-pose âl& show that he thought he believed
these documents were not genuine.
At the outset of the afternoon session
Judge S^acit toot occasion to mildly re
buke the attorneys for the plaintiff for not
making more rapid progress. He said ne
would insist upon there being more of an
effort to expedite matters.
CarraLho took the stand again, and in
answer to Attorney R. B. Muctiell said
he had made an exhaustive analysis of
Senator Fair's siznature and compared it
â with those appearing upon the pencil
will, the repubiication leaer and the d:s
puted e?ds.
'â¢Kindly _-.ye us your conclusions as to '
the genuineness of the disputed signa
tures, and also your reasons for reacning
tnose conclusions," said Mr. Mitchell im
pressively.
"In mj opinion they are not tne genu
ine signatures of James G. Fair," said the
expert, with equal impressiveness.
Carvalho then went on to explain, He ;
had made the startling : .-co very, accord- i
. te to ni- testimony, that Senator Fair
i.fted his â  -?a or pencil seven times in
signing nis name, and rarely ever devi
a:ed rona this rale. There seemed to be
evidences, too, that he -vrote it rapidly,
and it would be no difficulty for him to ;
scribble it plainly in the dark.
,â After â  careful study of the disputed i
signatures Carvalho saia he was com- j
pelled to confess that in many respects
they resembled marvelously the admit- \
telly genuine signatures. The slignt al
ieped discrepancies he discoverei were a
lew more "lifts" of the pencil in the dis- i
puted signatures than appeared to be tfie
rule with Senator Fair.
Carvalho wanted to assist himself along
ia his : scourâ by referring to some data
tha: he had compiled, but me: with, a S
stout objection from Mr. Foote. An argu- ;
rrrent followed, in which Judge Curtis and
Mr. Delma^ - ieipetwd in behalf of the ;
.defense's position, aud the result was that ;
â tne court sustained ths objection and di- !
recte-i the expert to depena ui>on his j
memory and ability to find flaws right
tnere in court unaided.
Resuming, Carvaiho said he was of the
opinion that the signature to the pencil |
v,ill Lad been "retouched" in fourteen dif
ierent places by the writer.
Ttie witness: said that he had discovered
wcat he termed irregularities of pen pres
sure in the disputed signatures, and some
misplacements of the same. He bel-.eve i
these had been written in a siow and
labored manner.
... As a wind-np ior CarvaJho'a direct ex
amination he was asked to stale how. la
â¢'â¢tiis opinion, the signatures to the deeds
s" were executed.
â â¢ ""I believe thevare drawingsâ trae.r.z?.
he said.
. Attorney Foote was not ready to pro
ceed with the cro^E-examination imme
tXlMtmij, so tlie case went over mtil this
morning in order to eive him an oppor
tunity to confer vilfa hi? associd:es-
Washed t'pon the Rocki.
IL Connell, while rowing la a boat along
the city front yesterday morning, disco red
the dead body of an anino-.vn man on the
rocks under the wharf at Main ar.d Folsora
streets. Tne deceased was evidently a labor
iaÂ» man, about 60 years old, with white hair
e-.d mustache. He was dres-ed in â  dark coat
aadvejtand light trousers wita black striDes
running through it. A carpenter's rnie a\nd a

VON TIEDEMANN`S CASE.
Judge Gcor^t 11. Bahn Testified That
He Believed the Defendant WaÂ«
Innocent.
Carl W. yon Tiedemann, on trial for
perjury, began his defense in Judge Wai
lace's court yesterday.
Readers of The Call will remember that
Yon Tiedemann was arrested on a charge |
of having assiite-.t in the production of a
bogus deed to whicn tne name of Harriet
P. Christy was 'orged.
In the forgery trial Yon Tiedsmann
aworÂ» that tne woman who imrjersonated j
Mrs. Christy was unknown to him before :
the negotiations began for the sale of the j
land, and identified a photograph of Mrs. l
Sarah Owen Spencer as a picture of the ',
woman who pretended to be Mrs. Christy.
He was acquitted on that charge, but
Mrs. Spencer was not in California when j
the deed was acknowledged, and conse- â 
quently Yon Tiedemann was arrested for :
perjury and that case is now on hearing. !
Lee D. Crai*, a notary public, testified j
that a woman representing herself to be I
Mrs. Harriet P. Christy was introduced to 1
him as the owner of the property de- j
scribed in the deed. He tnougnt the :
; woman who appeared before him to ac- i
. knowledge the deed somewhat resemb.ed j
Mrs, Sarah Owen Spencer, who was pres- |
ent in court, but Mr. Craig was not pre- j
pared to identify Mrs. Spencer as the per- j
son who impersonated Mrs. Christy.
Jadge(ieorge H. Bahrs proved to be the j
most favorable witness yet produced on j
behalf of Yon Tiedemann. Judce Bahrs }
ttstitied that ne was retained as attorney j
for Yon T edemann when he was first ar- j
rested. He cad a desre to satisfy mm- !
aeif in regard to Yon I:edemann's sincer
: ity, and accompanied him to Judge >
Denson's office, wnere a numter of photo- j
graphs were exhibited.
I'ne defendant unnesitatingly picked
oat a picture of Mrs. Spencer and said it
looked like the woman who palmsd her- !
' self off on him as Mrs. Christy, tne owner
of the proporty. An investigation of Mrs.
Spencer's record was made and Judge j
bahrs, taking ihat and other matters into
consideration, made up his mind that Yon j
Tiedemann was innocent and had been
imposed on by a lot of schemers.
John Coxie tp-iineii that he was In
Notary Craig's ertke when a woman pre
tending to bs Mr-. Christy actnowledged
the deed. The matter was impressed od
his mind by the fact that the papers were
full of the etory of the fraui a f w days
later. He couid not identify the woman,
but he sustained tae statement of Yon
liedmanu that tne deed was actnowl
edeed in the way he described.
Attorney Alexander Campbell read the
transcript of tne testimony of J. C. C.
Russell and Mrs. Jones, taker, at a former j
irial. Mr-. Jones said ihat Guy S. Whit
comb, a noted half-inieres; swindler, who
; had some dealings wi:h Yon Tiedemann,
! endeavored to induce her to imperscnate
Mrs. Christy, but she refused to have any- j
thing to do with it.
The trial will consume all of next week.

AGAINST CAEPÂ£T-BEATEES.
The Board of Health M ,-Â«y Isolate Them
as DuDgergut to Health.
It is probable that the Board of Health '
will soon begin an agitation to have tne
carpet-beating establishments of tnis City :
remoTed from thickly populated districts j
and placed where there ia less danger from ;
them to the public health.
Tne matter was discussed at a meeting
of the board yesterday and Dr. Lovelace ]
stated that they were a menace to health j
because of the disease eerms that are i
beaten out and spread abroad while going i
through the machinery. A complaint J
was received ajenast the Spanlding estab- !
iishment, but Dr. Loveiace stated that it :
was no worse than other* and that all |
should ba p.aced under restrictions.
. . The matter will be aitcusse-.i again when i
the board has been advised of its legal j
rigats in the premises.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 20, 1897.
TWO FAVORITES
WON AN INGLESIDE
Another Extremely Quiet
Day of Charity
, Racing.
Mainstay Was Extensively
Backed and Won in a*
Eig Gallop.
S\ Calatine Down-rd Milesio Very
Easily â Mollie R Let H;r Support
ers Eowa With a Thul.
Another ordinary sized crowd saw six
very cheap events decided at Ingleside
yesterday. The horses entered were, for
the most part, the cheaper class, and there
was a great scarcity of enthusiatm mani
fested. Favorites scored on two occasions.
i Atkin and Lottridge furnished tne fav
orite for the. two-year-old event in Milesiu,
which went to the post at odds of 3 to 2.
St. Calatine, the second choice, outran
her field from the jump, leading tne fav
orite out by fully eight lengths, cover
the four and one-half furlongs in :56.
Rosa, a 30 to 1 shot, ridden by Shepard,
was a close third.
The second event, at six furloDg*, was a
very open betting affair, with Ricardo,
Heartsease, Corriente and Joan ail weil
supported. The latter filly, sto 1 in the
ring at post time, headed Corriente when
straightened for the wire, and won by two
lengths from Heartsease, tho second
choice. Doubtful was a good third.
Tom Boyle landed the third purse hung
up with his mare San Tnzza, whica went
LO the post at odds of 6to 1. The second
choice, Sallie Clicquot, led ncr field to the
stretch, where San TnzzÂ» pulled out of
the bunch and in a herce drive downed
imp. Trance a short head. Horatio took
thow honors. King William, the favorite,
was shnt off at the end.
San Marco, played down to 2 to 1 favor
itism, captured the mile selling run very
easily at the wire. iiereutio, ridden by
Macklin. led to tne paddock, where Ber
gen shook the favorite up Â»nd he won
handily irom Olive in 1.42%. Veiox,
awÂ»y poorly, ran a very ordinary race.
AU o: the big money went in on Main
stay to win the six-furlone sprint that
came next, forcing his odds down to 6 to 5
â¢a the horses came out. Taking the lead
before the stretch was reached the big
cnestnut won as he please! from Lozan.
Pat Mur; by was third, beaten but half a
length.
"Bone-Doctor John Kobbins* mare Mol
lie R was blunged on to carry off tne final
race on the card at a mile, her odds being
hammered down from threes to Bto 5.
She raced with Tempestuous to the
stretch and then bad enough. The latter
h jr.Â«e, at 6 to 1 in the betting, maintained
the c.ip s"t, winnms by a head at the
wire irom William OB. an outsider.

MABEL KEATING`S BONDS.
For the Second Time Within a Week
They Uave BÂ«en Declared-
Worthleaa.
For the second time within a week
Judge Conlan has been forced to the con
clusion ihat bonds accepted by Judge
Campbell for tne release of Mabel Keat
ing, a notorious pickpocket, were worth
less.
On the first occasion she was released
on $1000 bonds while under arrest for
grand larceny and the Judge refuse! to
recognize the bond and issued a bench
warrant for her arrest. She â was arrested
and gave $500 cash bail lor her release.
Monday sue was heid to answer before
the Superior Court t>y Judge Conlan on
the grand larceny charse in $40uG bonds,
and that afternoon 9he was released,
bonds having been furnished.
The sureties were RocKwell McMnllin,
rancner, 71- Kea'ny street, and Mark
Sena, salesman, 621.' McAllister street.
McMuhin qualified oa 600 acres of land
in Ten Mile River Township near Fort
Br.tge. Mendocino County, valued at
$10,000, and Sma on a lot on Cypress
street, Oakland, vaiaed at $7000 and
mortgaged :or $1200. On a bond a few
days ago Sena vaiUÂ«J the same property
at $3-500, with a mongage of $700.
Expert Newman reported to Judge
Conlan yesterday mornin.' that in his
opinion the bond was worthless and
when Mabe.'s attorney demanded the re
turn of the $o*Ai cas!i bail, Clerk *oiey
on the advice oi Chief Lees refused and
the attorney threatened to bring sui:
against Foley lor $10,000 damages. The
grand larceny ci-Â» will probably be as-
Mened at once to one of the Supe.ior
Court* and a bench warrant issued for
Ma bels arrest.

CRASHED TOGETHER
AT FULL SPEED
Presidio Artillerists Rids
Against Each Other, Kill
ing Their Horses.
Fortunately the Riders Who
Were Thrown Were Shaken
Up, but Not Hart.
The Result of the Biseball Game and
the Sz-veral Evens of the Field
Day at tr.e Military Post.
There was a large attendance of citi
zens at the Presidio yesterday to witness
the events presented by toe soldiers of
tbat post at tha monthly field day.
Among the many spectators who occupied
the grand stand were Brigad.er-Generat
Shatter and Colonel Miles, the com
mander of the post.
There were many exciting events, but
the most exciting was a collision between
two men of Battery I, Third Artillery,
daring the moanted relay race, which re
salted in the killing of both horses.
There had been a race between a team
from Troop B, one from Trcop I, another
from Battery F and a fourth from Battery
C. Tne team from Troop I and from
Batttry F were the winnera and then
these two were to run again to determine
which shouid be the final victor.
Tnere were five men from each team at
scratch on the east eni of the 100-yarU !
course and a like number at scratch at the '
western end. One ruan carrying an en- ;
valope roUe at breakneck pace from one '
scratch to the o:her, passed the envelope ;
to one of the men at the otr.er end an- in
that way the envelope passed from one to
the other until the last man to receive it
had delivered it at the eastern scratch.
The men of Troop I did their work well,
bat the last messenger from east to west
did not make good connection with the .
man waiting at the western scratch, and
tbat occasioned some delay.
Tbe mounted man who last receive 1
tbe envelope saw that tbe â  delay nad Â«
caused bis team to lose, bat suddenly re
alized that it' be dropped out his -team
would lose second place, so be put spurs
to h s horse and started across the cuur.-e ;
as fast us his horse could go.
â  At the same moment another member
of the same team started to. return to the
stables, iollowinz tbe example of others
wt.o had preceded .him, going a; full
speed. The rider who waÂ« going ea-t
raised hi 3 head just in time to see the
other rider coming directly toward him. :
He reined bis horse so as to pa^a on the
left, but not soon Â«r,onÂ»h, and the result i
was that tbe westbound rider's horse ran |
his head against the right snoulaer of the I
norse ol ihe eaatboand rider.
There was a tembte impact, a noise that I
sounded l'.se two empty casfca strikir.e |
violently against each otner, the two :
horses fell and the men lumb:ed off. one
on bis back, the other on his s;de. T en i
there was a cry from the horrified spec
tators, for all for a moment thought the
men had b^n Killed. , .
All the officers wuhin the course and a
numoer of the soldiers ran np to where
the accident had occurrei. and i: was ;
soon discovered that whiie both men. ''
Freemer and Mickell, bad been severely I
shaken up, they were not injured. * but
it was different with tbe horses. The one j
that was eoing west had his neck broken !
and was dead almost as soon as he touched â¢
tbe ground.- The other had nis back
broken, and he lingered aDout ten minutes
ar.'i died.
Both horses were dragged off the parade
ground.
The came of baseball was the first event
of the day, and was between a nine from
the artillery and one from the infantry.
The following nameo composed the bat
tery team: Ifeycn, Giiaon, Haynes,
Thomas, Tony, Kuntz, Gienny, Sheriocs
and Petticord.
The iniantry team wa?: Kelly, Frey,
Vineyard, W.thington, Borfce, Noyes,
Engstrom, McC*eve ana Whitlow.
Ine men who took part in the pame de
veloped the fact tbat in each nine there
are some first-class batters aud good ;
catchers behind the bat, bat, except in a
f-?w instances, the fteiders were not very
successful The work of the fielders was, !
however, cons.derably interfered with ir>
the matter of gauging high bail*. The
exceptions were Gienny of Troop I. who,
in the third winning, caught, a riy as i
gracefully as was ever taken by a profes- j
sional. The other was Sergeant jjurke o: j
Com puny A, who also made a very pretty j
catch.
The game was played with a good deal
of vigor and spirit, which was continued
u:itii noon, when it was called. Seven in
nings had been played with the following
rexait: Artillery 12, infantry 19.

THE ADULTERATED BRANDY
Colonel Irish Will Not Allow
the "Sheep Dip" to Go
to En? and
Bat Collector Wiss Has the Pow.-r
to Override !be Naval o!ficer f 3
Wil ! .
Colonel John P. Irish, Naval Officer,
instructed his deputies yesterday not to
aiiow :he San Francisco United Btetei
Manufacturing Bonded Warehouse Com
piay to ship any of the "docored" Caii
lornia brandy out of this port.
His deputy, E. W. Maslin. waited at the
office until after the usual hour in order
that he might, carry out the instructions
of his chief and refuse to attach his official
signet of permssion to export the "sheep
dip," but none of the representatives of
the warehouse company put in an appear
ance and the aliezed brandy is stili under
the American flag.
Mr. Maslin was for many years secre
tary of the State Board of Trade and
tates a lively in'e-est in everything per
taining to the welfare of tne State.
He said:
'â¢Enelisb people who may buy that
dope under the guaranty that it came
from a bonded warehouse will have a very
poor idea of the quality of California
brandy. The term 'bonded warehouse'
means a good deal to arr Englishman. It
means that the United States Govern
ment has guaranteed the purity of the
article, according to his understanding of
it. The exportation of rbis stn9 will seri
ously iÃJun the wine and brandy makers
of California.
'â¢Tne Pure- Food Society, the State
Board of Trade, the V.ticuitural Society
and ail other interested parties should
take up the matter. They ought lo co
after other distillers here who are adul
terating California brandy with corn spir
its and prune juice, and mining the repu
tation of one of California' 3 chief prod
ucts."
Collector Wise has the power, however,
to override the sfÂ«VÂ»l Officer in this mat
ter, and allow the stuff to depart on its
errand oi burning holes in the liver oi the
proud Briton. _

The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it. If any. the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains,
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure Is high in the interior j
anu low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south alonâ¢ thÂ» coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low- Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure fallins to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

The.c wÂ»s nothing of special Interest In to-day's

They Â»rÂ»- offeci d no supper; from outside specu

ea*ly to place any estimate on the spring wheat
crop, which has not been In the ground in many
secilous over . three weeks. ' The tact remains
spring wheat ii never made until it is in bag.

Depressed Easteru and foreign markets did not
enthuse courage into wheat traders this morning.
Wea.her conditions favored au advance. Decem
ber wheat opened at $1 27%;* the next trade was
at $1 27J.4, closing $1 273/ 3 , sellers. Reports from
the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys give the
weather as very hot, with moderate north winds.
10:15 a. m skssion. [
The session opened with little or no animation.
Sellers and buyers kept away from each other's
limit*. A prominent shipper bid $1 27 for 3000
tons of December wheat. .\o one seemed inclined
to satisfy the bid.
Barley was in moderate demand at a small ad
vance over yesterday's qu cations,
11:16 A. m. SKSSION.
Stronger Chicago martcet stimulated prices in
wheat ut the opening. Buyers were willing to pay
*/4@%c over ciosing prices of the previous ses
siun. oitVriugs continue light, shorts bacomme
more nervous, un any further showing of
Htrencth they ill start covering. Inn qulei way
considerable short selling has been dove during
the past few days. Wheat in this market shows
remarkable strength cons.derin^ the weakness
in Eastern and foreign mar.ets. Local condi
: tions as yet are uncertain. The trade prefer heep
iv-K within reasonable limits until a more definite
basis s established.
Few p edict v larger wheat crop than last year,
while others claim a very much less one. 'lhese
estimates at present esiablish the fighting ground.
Present weatner couditious are not encouraging.
Much complaint is heard from sections heretofore
considered fortunate. (
2 P. M SKSSIOX. '
Wheat seemed to have more friends at the after
noon session. Weather conditions worked upon
the loflingi of shorts, causing them to chunge
from seller to buyer.
December opened at $1 27% and closed at
$1 i'B. Reports from the inienor were in favor of
longs. Tjere was quite a spnnkll X of new buy

BONUSES ARE DUE
Franchises Are So Mixed
That Collection Will
Be Difficult.
"Gross Receipts" on Transfer
Lines Is a Term Not Easy
to Construe.
The Berkelsy Consolidated Has Long
Been in the City's Debt but
Has Not Paid.
Oakland Office Fan Fwjokmoo Call,)
908 Broadway, May 19. i
The time has now arrived when the
bonuses 10 the city government, due from
come of the owners of aireel railroad fran
chises, have to be paid, and considerable
difficulty is anticipated in straightening
the matter out.
When the franchises were granted five
years ago there was a clause in each fran
chise ordering that th* company pay to
the City Treasurer one-quarter of one per
cent of the gross receipts of the road at
the end of five years. Little attention
was paid to this matter at the time and
the terms of the payment weri> lsft IB a
very. ambiguous condition. At subsequent
intervals the same roads acquired other
franchises for other sections of roads, and
now it is a matter of great difficulty to de
cide which part of the original road for
which a franchise was granted five years
ago shall pay the percentage.
As a matter of fact it la absolutely im
possible for street railroads to keep ac
count of how much money is collected on
the different sections of their system, be
cause they transfer from one branch to
another and cannot distribute, without
having a large force of clerks, tbe appor
tionment to each section having an in
dividual franchise. The matter will be
aomev.-hat simplified when the franchise
last granted sha.l havj been in uÂ«e for
five years, because 1 then the gross receipts
â will mean the entire income of the road.
Tne City Attorney has been instructed
by tbe Council to brine suit to collect tbe
percentage irom tbe Oakland Consoli
dated Company, winch is now controlled
by the Realty Syndicate, of which F. M.
bmiih is president.
The mam line of this road obtained its
franchise much more than five years aeo,
but no effort has yet been made to
collect the perc?ntage nor Has the road of
fered it. Since it was opened it has ex
tended its system by new franchises in all
directions, and as several roads wi.l have
bpen running for five years in a short time
the question of bonus will be watched with
great interest by them all.
As an indication of the methods that the
railroads are likely to adopt it has been
recalled that three years ago wheu there
was very excitable bidding for a fran
chise down Washington street, one com
pany offered to give the total receipts for
Â»he privilege of the franchise. When the
matter was decided tiie company calmly
stated that had it been awarded tne fran
chise it would have instructed its con
ductors not to have collected the fares of
passengers unlil turning into Thirteenth
street. There is little doubt but that as
bonuses becomes due the City wili have to
take iegei step* to collect them.
REGINA LITTLE DAMAGED
With Care Saturday's Fatality
Could Have Baen Prevented
Easily.
The Wreck Has B=tn Towei B^ck
10 Her Berth at the California
B(n '.house
Oakland Office Sa^t Fbahcroo Call.)
908 Broadway, May 19. f
The wreck of the Eegina wai toweci j
into the estuary this morning, and an ex- j
nmination showed that the damage done
to the hull wa3 very slight and can be re
paired for a few dollars. Had the ill-fated
party known where to look for the leak
tiiey couid easily hare stuffed it with one
of their yachting caps, but their ignor
ance of its locality cost two lives.
The relief party under Commodore
Lancaster found the ill-fated boat on the
ruud banks half submerged. Ttiey had \
little trouble in Dailinp the water oat of i
the cabin, when they discovered a hole a
little larger than a man's fist. It was
)i?bt amidships on the starboard side.
The rock had only penetrated the outside
timbers; it had not broken the ribs, nor
did it break tbe ceiling inside.
The nature of the accident was such
that the crew, while they could see the
water rushing into the boat, could not
possibly hare told where the hole was
situated, ana conÂ«equently nothing was
done to stop the fatal rush of tbe waters.
The hole in the plank* is of sufficient
BZ9 to *dniit enough of water to have
sunk the yacht in two or three rr.inutes,
and there is no doubt that the rapid man
ner in which the Kegina filled caused the
crew to lose their heads aud acramble a*
best they couid for safety.
The yacht was towed back to her old
berth, and was carefully inspecteJ to-day
by the survivors, who all admit that had
they known just wli*reshe struck it would
have been an easy matter to keep her
afloat.
Friends of the missing young menâ
Larue and Vaughn â returned tu-rtay from
the scene of tlie accident, having given up
all hope of finding the bodies in the vicin
ity until they wash ashore, which ihev
ate not likely to do for some days. It is
impossible to tell where the bodies may
eventuall.v b* found, as there are many
currents rushing around Red Kock, and
it is not improbable that the remains may
be carried out to sea and never recovered.

OFFICERS OF THE STATE EPWORTH LEAGUE.
OAKLAND, Cal.. May 19.â Several hundred delegates arrived to-day to take part in the sixth annual conference of the California Ep
worth League ef the Methodist Church South, which opened this evening with a reception. The actual business of the convention opens
to-morrow and there will be three sessions a day, closing on Sunday night. The proceedings to-morrow will be as follows:
Thursdayâ 9 a. m., praise service, led by Miss Clara Fisher of thlco; 0:30. organization and appointment of committees; 10, reports
from leagues.
2p. M., praise service, led by Rev. L. C. Ren fro of Lincoln ; 2:30, address, "What can bo done to make the literary department more
effective ?" by Miss Estelie Dnka of Downey, discussion and suggestions; 3:30. paper. "How are we studying the BibleT" by Mrs. E. G.
Humphrey of Linden; 3:50. "The Epworth Era," by Secretary Steel; 4:30, "What should we do with the reading course?" Mrs. L. W.

case of Mrs. M. S. McCulloueh asainst Dr.
M. E. McCullough should have been tried
to-day, but an extension of five days was
allowed. The deposition of the doctor is
being taken and contains much sensa
tional matter which will probably neces
sitate a deposition from tbe plaintiff. It
is very evident that all thought of com
promise has oeen dispensed with and that
both husband and wife have said so much
for publication that neither will be satis
fied except with an open trial.
MEDAL COMPETITION.
Public School Pupils to Write Essays
on the Free Library.
ALA.MEDA, Cal., May 19 âThe board
of trustees of the Free Library wish to
test public sentiment in a measure upon
the estimation in which the institution is
held by the people, and in order to do so
in a certain sense has decided to institute
a medal competition among the pupils of
the public schools. Two handsome silver
medals have been donated for tbe pur
pose, and the pupils are to be asked to
compete for them by writing essays upon
the subject, "The Public Library as an
j Adjunct to tue Public School Depart
j mem."
I These essays are to be not less than 200
| words and not more than 530 words in
j length, and the competition is open to all
t school children. One medal will be
! awarded to the boy having tne best essay
and the other to the girl who ranks high
est. It is expected that the children will
take ereat interest in the competition.
â  .-.-â â  .-High School Wanted.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. May 19.â Much of the j
time of the Board of Education at its
meeting last evening was taken up with !
the discussion of the necessity of a build- j
; ing for the High School. Superintendent
Sullivan pointed out that the present ac- j
cornmodations of the High School in the j
same structure with tha Height Gram- {
mar School are entirely inadequate and
are constantly becoming more so. ii.c
building now occupied is twenty years old,
and is not up to modern requirements in
any particular. The progress of the
school system in this city in the past ten
years has been something marvelous, and
it is in line with that progress that the
city is now asked to provide a suitab.e
bui.din? for the High School. Public sen
timent favors tne proposition, and it is
not apprehended that there will be any
serious opposition to tba raising of money
enough to erect a buildinc which shall ba
an ornament to the town and will suffice
for years to come.

CITY OFFICIALS AND THEIR IDEAS, NO. 6.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 19.â J. W. McClymonds, Superintendent of Scnools, believes that no
man in a political position should use "yes" and "no" hastily. When Mrs. Todd startled Oak
land and San Francisco with her book, "Plnxit," the devoted a whole chapter to McClymonds
under the title "Smooth Mac."
When asked recently if he had ever talked politics to School Directors, he replied: "You
see, that is very difficult to answer. Politics is a very peculiar quantity, and everybody has
their ows idea of how it is constituted. Kenily. that question is a 'cinch.' "
"Do you know you are living I ' wÂ«s once rsk -'d ot the Superintendent.
"Really, now, what with the many theories advocated of theosophists, vpirltualists, re
cmbodiment, etc., and the many definitions of life and death, it is really difficult to give a
decided answer that would be scientifically satisfactory to everybody," said lit.
Mr. McCiymonds Has just been re-elected for the lourta time.

Salisbury declares he ha* no real estate
in California, but owns property in Coofc
County, 111., valued at $250,000. This is
mortgaged to Wells- Fargo lor $110,000, and
there are other mortgages upon it, amount
ing In all to $150,000. Foreclosure suits
are now pending, and with interest and
co<ts there will be little, it anything, left
of the Illinois property.
It is also admitted that there are six suits
pending against him in the Circuit Court
of the Northern District of California to
recover $210,000, wth interest from July,
1892.
There are no assets, with the exception
of his personal property, valued at $400.
Salisbury says that so far as he knows
there exists no right of action in his be
half against any persons of value. He is
not positive on this point, but says that if
he lias any claims against anybody they
must be so old that he bits forgotten all
about them.

A OALFS COSTLY MEAL.
Chewed Up 9210, Which I'ncle Sam
Kindly Redeemed.
Treasurer Morgan to-day received a
little wooden b>x from Texas containing
a wad of what appeared to be fragments of
United States bills. Later in the day a
letter from J. B ackingame of a small
town near Gulveston, Tex., arrived nt the
Treasury Department which explained
the contents of the box. The wad of
crueii paper is all that is left of $210 owned
by Mr. Blacingarne, which he resiued
from the stomach of a yearling calf. It
seems that the Texan recently sold a herd
of cattle, for which ho received $470 in
billi, as follows: One $100, one $50 and
sixteen $20 bills. He Dlaced the money in
tn oidinary memoranJum locketfoook,
I at the bills were in such a poution that
the ends stuck leyond tlie edge of {be
book. Â£lackin;nme carelessly threw his
coat on the ground in a cow lot
and a yearling coming along ,Â«aw the
rreen hi! Is and proceeded to dev-ur them.
The animal took in the entire bunch at
one niot.nthful and was discovered in the
act of chewing Blacingame's $470 The
Texan, witn the assistance of his brother,
succeeded in recovering from the mouth
of the calf thirteen of the $20 bills in a
comparatively uninjured condition. This
money was aiterwari passed off by Blac
insamein payment for some caitle. The
calf was shortly killed and from its
stomach was taken a mass of chewed bills,
stained and discoloied. Tlie fragments
wt-re boxed up and sent to the redemution
division of the Treasury Department.
Blacngnme prepared a sworn statement
of the disappearanco of his money and
forwarded it to Treasurer Morgan. ThÂ«
latter hal the case examined and found
the facts to be as stated. According $210
in crisp, new bank not?s were to>day sent
to tne c.ttli) dealer io replace the money

SOON TO ELECT
A NEW CAPTAIN
Company F, Fifth Regiment,
Is Now Caucusing on
Candidates.
Captain Wethern's Promotion to
the Governor's Uaff Creates
a Vacancy.
Several H mb:rs Are Anxicm to
Command the Company Shou d
Ctbblcdick Decline.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90d Broadway, May 19. )
Now that Company IP, Fifth Infantry,
N. G. C, has fairly setilea in its new
quarters in the Hook building the talk
of who shall be captain has been resumed.
About one month ago Captain George
H. Wethern of Company F was promoted
to aid-de-camp with rank of major on
Major-GeneralJames' staff, but owing to
the fact that it lias not appeared in official
orders no action can be taken to elect his
successor.
Captain Wethern is an old member of
the National Guard, having been a mem
ber when Company F was a cavalry troop.
He has worked his way up from one posi
tion to another until before his promotion
be ranked with the ablest captains in the
guard. He was perfectly at home when
he commanded the battalion, and his
promotion is not a surprise to those who
know him.
With his men in the company he is
known as a perfect tactician and a wise
financier, always popular with bis large
company. The men regret losing him,
but are proud to see him honored.
At last Monday evening's meeting the
members discusse't the comine election
and the possible candidates for the cap
taincy.
Firstâ Lieutenant W. H. Cobbledick,
who is an old member of the guard, has
been offered the position and would be
the unanimous choice of the company,
out it is rumore 1 that Cobbiedick does
not want the position f in fact he says he
has not the time to devote to it.
Second â Lieaenant L. E. WenJt may,
in case Lieutenant Cobbledick finally de
clines, be elected captain.
The members offered Major John F.
Hayes, their former captain, the place,
but this was out of the question. Major
Hayes thanked the members and de
clined.
To fill the vacancy which will be caused
by the promotion of either Lieutenant
Wenk or Lieutenant Cobbledick some
member will have to be chosen from the
enlisted men in the ranks.
There are three men in the race, but the
best of feeling prevails.
The three are Quartermaster Sergeant
C. C. Covalt, First Sergeant Scott and
Second Sergeant J. Higterraeyer. Tt is
quite certain that Sergeant Scott will be
the choice of the company, as he is next
in line of promotion. However, Sergeants
Covalt and Hintermeyer have quite a fol
lowing.
L euienant Cobbledick is in command
of the company, and orders calling an
election are expected any day now.

A FAMOUS MODEL-MAKER
The Wizard of the National Museum
Now in a WorJchouve.
â¢Jack" Hendley, ib.9 famous "W zard"
Handley of the National Museum, ii now
an inmate of the hospital at the District
Workhouse. He is one of the mo3t re
markable men the Government In s ever
had in its employ, and since he lett the
service of the Museum an 1 Agricultural
Department, where he was a familiar
figure fjr year?, there has been no one
who could duplicate his work. Hsndley
was a moJel-luaksr. His geniusâ and the
t rra is usid advisedly â lies in a marvel
ous eye for form and color, with an equally
marvelous facility for reproducing the
same in his c Â»sts of plaster and other com
i ositions. Heniley can mimic anything
in the nt m re ( f art, from a housefly to a
stone hatchet of the monolithic period.
Professor Oiis Mason of the museum,
for whom some of Hundley's best work
ha* b*en done, confesses that he cannot
pick out one of Hendley's models in a
case full of prehistoric stone implements
without picking the pieces up and scratch
iiie them to Bad which one la made of
plaster. The w.zird has made scores of
fruit models for the Agricultural Depart
ment, fuzzy-coated peaches, transparent
Malaga grapes and red-hearted water
unions that would pass mutter on any
dinner table for the genuine article, and
one or two administrations back he made
half a dozen raw oysters on the half-shell
for a Cabinet officer, who used to regu
larly fool bis intimate friendsat dinner by
ringing in the fake bivalves on thÂ«m. And
fake they were, from the moist-looking
shells to the quarter of a lemon reposing
in the midst of the plate.

Professor Brown Goode had at the time
of his death what he considered the great
est piece of work Hendley ever did. It
was the model of a Potomac shad, made
in the flexible composition used tor all of
Hendley's fish casts. Its silver scales and
filmy tail and fins were as glistening and
lifelike as though it had just come ouf of
the water. But the most exquisite part
was where half the head had been sliced
down ana turned back, showing the pills
all done in the translucent collodion com
position, with the red and blue tracery of
the veins running through them, and the
white thornlike teeth shining in the jaws.

TOO BRAVE TO HGHT.
Two Stories of George I). Prenticeâ Hi*
Advent Into Kentucky.
Some stories of the late George D. Pren
tice, the famous Kentucky journalist,
wh;cn liave recently been collected, show
him to have been a brave man. Though
he was fully conscious that in Kentucky,
as he found it when he first went there, it
must bo necessary to "show fight," ne was
yet far from b.nng a duelist
Prentice's errand, whan, as a green
young Yankee, he went to Kentucky in
1830, was to write the life of Henry Clay.
He did the work largely at a place called
Olympian Springs and was fond of writ
ing out in the suade of a huge chestnut
tree In the woods.
Usually when thus engaged he kept a
shotgun with him, as occasionally tempting
gam* came his way and he had the uni
versal American hunting instinct. One
he sat with pencil and paper in hand, his
back against the chestnut tree and the
shotgun leaning against the other side of
the tree. His thoughts was lost in his
work.
But just then a very ugly looking back
woodsman came up and confronted him.
The man wore a buckskin jacket ana a
coonskin cap, and he carried a long-bar
reled rifle of the old backwoods type.
Evidently he was one of Clay's political
enemies, for he said, menacingly:
"Air you the chap that's writin' Henry
Clay's li c? 1 '
"Yes," said Prentice.
'Wai, you quit that and write my life,
and do it monat'ous quicK, too."
As quick as a rta-h Prentice reached
around the tree, seized his shotgun and
had it leveled on the backwoodsman.
"I won't write your life," said he, "but
I'll take it if you don't leave here!"
Then the fellow declared that he was
joking, but "allowed" that the good-look
ing, young Yankee was game, and de
parted in good order.
After he had begun to edit a Louisville
paper, Prentice was once challenged to a
duel. He responded to the invitation
thus:
"It takes only one fool to send a chal
leng*, but it takes two to hght. and I beg
to be omitted from the category."
He wfsonte assaulted in the street at
Louisville by another Kentucky editor
with a pistol, ana when, by the aid of his
Knife, he successfully defended himself
and over Dowered the man, forcing him to
drop the pistol, thecrowd called upon him
to inflict an injury with the knife on hij
assailant.
"How conld I harm an unarmed man ?"
Prentice asked the crowd; and ! c was ap
plauded as he suffered his assailant, wbcyn
he had himself disarmed, to arise.
It is needless to say that a man of such
physical and moral courage was permitted
to die a natural death. â Youth's Com
panion.

a guard ol honor to escort you to the park.
The G. A. R. follow in full force and the P. O.

want to give it. Your letter offering to pay for
our band, and also a leiter 10 Mr. Tobey, presi
oent oi the P. O. of A. We have no regular
band at present, although they could be got
together on short notice. I thank you for the
kind offer, but cannot allow the Bunker Hill
Association to be put to any expense on our
account. Will be pleased to have some of
your circulars. We had a Methodist picnic
here last week, and I had many calls for circu
lars our people wished to send their friends
in San Francisco. I received a few tind they
all brought some one. We are all looking for
a good time on the 17th, and there is great en
thusiasm over the celebration. Yours truly,

The dedication of "Bunker Hill Park" on

AS EMPEKOR'S TABLE.
Contract Between the German King
and II im Cook for Supplies.
The German Emperor, we were recently
iniormed, bas a contract with riis cook to
supply hm with lunches and dinners at
7s 6d a head, the wine coming from the
imperial cellar?. Of course, state dinners j
are paid for apart ; the contract is only for
family meals, to wbich, however, a few
persons are every day invited. The E!yÂ«ee ;
cook mast provide meals to the family, !
consisting, with the military and private j
(Â«ecretary, of seven persons, and feed j
eight private servant?, out of 70 Jrancs
a day. This leaves very little margin
for waste, and, in fact, compels the
servants to wait, just as in any bour
geois family, until the master's din
ner is over, and make the best of
what is left. When tnere are guests the
chef is allowed 10 make an extra charge,
not exceeding 8 francs a head. The wine
is provided by AI. Fa u re' 8 butler, and the
coffee comes from the pantry, which de
partment is responsible for the petit de
jeuner in the morning. The arrange men t>
are superintended by Mme. Faure horself,
who interviews any new kitchen official,
and acquaints him with her terms. State
dinners ere supplied by Pot?l et Chabot,
at not more than 12 francs a head, not in
cluding wine, coffee or cigars. This caterer
sometimes sends as many as forty cooks
and potboys, who bring their saucepans
with them and is'.ke possession of Hie big
kitchen under the terrace. Mme. Faure 1*
about to chance all the copper saucepans
of the Elysee kitchen (the small ones for
everyday use) which were purchased in
1848, and is getting new ones lined with
silver, for fear of lead poisoning. How
ever, as a dozen saucepans are enough for
Ihe usual requirements of the Elysee the
expense will not be very Kreat. So far
from tbe Elysee setting an exam; le ol'un
dernoc atic habits, us envious tongues
have asserted, it hardly keeps up with the
pace of the official world.
The President of the Senate spends
twice as much as M. Faure over hia pub
lic dinners â nam-ly, 25 francs. The
President ot the Senate does not receive
Â£60,000 a year, iike M. Faure, but he en
tenains so much less. The most hos
piiable President was M. Casimir-Perier,
who has a private foriune of Â£fX),000 a
>ear: the least hospitable one was M.
Grevy, who saved not only the greater
part of lii 3 salary, but nearly all his ex
panses, and retired with a pretty fortune.

Reputations of the Principals B ing
Smirched as the Scandal
Is Prcbed.
There does not seem to be any soft spot
for the Blair family to land on these days
The revelations of the wooing of MisÂ»
Lillian by General Barillas last summer,
as told by Attorney Dimond, are of eoursu
going to be vigorously contradicted, but
the negative affords almost as little con
solation as the positive.
In her refutation of Dimond's assertions
Miss Blair, her mother and sister have
made affidavits that they knew all the
time that the swarthy Don Juan, whose
frolics have kicked up all sorts of trouble,
had a wife and children awaiting his re
turn. But to fortify these statements and
purge herself of any taint of the charge of
blackmail the young woman has made
some very unpleasant admissions of her
relations with Barillas. Mrs. Blair, the
mother, and Mrs. Phillips, the sister,
have made corroborative sworn state
ments. Keally, it looks as if all the prin
cipals in the scandal will be smirched
Defore it is over.
When Miss Blair decided to abandon
her suit against Barillas she sought his
asent in this City, Louis Hirsch, of the
firm o' Castle Brothers, and to him she
unburdened her woes in a manner that
precipitated the present scandal. To
Hirsch the young woman and her mother
accused Dimond of conspiracy to black
mail the coffee-planter. Dr. Perrault and
Dentist Cranz were included, the women

declared, in the plot. For themselves
they reserved the role of instruments to
carry out the scheme. Dr. Cranz had
first learned of Miss Lillian's intimacy
with Barillas by a mere accidentâ he saw
the Guatemalan's picture In her watch
case. Soon he wormed the whole truth
from her, with a result that Dr. Perrault
was let into the secret, who in turn con
fided it to Attorney Pimond. According
to the Blairs the lawyer saw in the inti
macy existing between Lilian and Baril
las an opportunity for a suit of breach of
promise and seduction, or, in other words,
simple blackmail. Dimond then pro
ceeded to coach them in stories for the
witness-stand, and to this end prepared
statements for them to comm.it to
memory.
But at the last moment Mrs. Blair and
her daughters, repented of the part the
lawyer was creating for them, with a re
sult" that Barilias' agent was communi
cated with, and the whole plot laid before
him.
This was not the first intimation Hirsch
had that there wa* a "woman scrape" i n
store for Barillas. Rumors that Miss
Blair intended seeking damages for a
broken heart reached the ears of Castle
Brothers early in February, and they at
once advised Barillas, who was then re
turnina from Europe to take a steamer at
New York direct for Guatemala and thus
avoid trouble. Hirsch was then in Cen
tral America. Upon his return on March
28 Attorney Ach called upon him and in
formed him oi the true situation of af
fairs, at the same time thowing him the
letters and photographs Miss Blair had
turned over to DimonJ. Hirsch lost no
time in acquainting Barillas with the de
tails of the ca c e by mail. Ach had acreed
to wait until May 15 to give to the coffee
planter time to settle with Miss Blair, if
he^o desired. t"<Â« value of her wrongs be
ing fixed at $20,000.
But the gay old Don Juan evidently
thought he had been benefactor long
enough to the Blairs. Hirsch in his letter
had intimated that it was a blackmailing
scheme, and that Hibas, the interpreter,
was the chief schemer. And instead of a
check to repair Miss Blair's lacerated af
fections, there came back a cable to prose
cute the case to the end.
This was how Hirsch sized up the whole
affair:
MaTCh 30, 1897.
My Dear General: I returned here yesterday,
and only have time to write you a few words to
inform you what has happened since your de
parture from San Francisco, and what has
come to my knowledge since my arrival here.
I hHd hardly left the steamer when I received
a visit from a lawyer, who had been ioid 1 am
a friend of yours, and that I was prot cting
your interests. Tha conversation was opened
by him telling me of a girl named Lillian
Blair in relation with you while you were
here. Rumors of some difficulty with reier
ence to this girl came to the hearing of the
Messrs. Castle, and iortunuiely tliey tele
graphed you through the medium of J. Apari
cio & Co. not to come here under any circum
stances, aud to return to Guatemala by way of
Panama.
1 am very happy you have followed this ad
vice of my houÂ»e, because you would have
exposed yourself to disagreeable trouble had
you passed through here. For lack of time I
cannot write you in detail br this mail, but I
will tell you in a few words what has taken
place. Lillian Blair, ihrougn her attorneys
there are four she has employedâ has pre
pared a lawsuit asking for your arrest at the
moment of your arrival, accusing you of se
duction and breach of promise of marriage.
The principal witness is Ribas, of whom I
have spoken to you frequently. Ribas will
declare thai you have a*surea the girl that
you are a widower and that you would marry
her on your return to Snn Francisco. There
are furthermore in the hands of the lawyers
declarations under oath of the mother telling
you have asked for the girl's hand and also
declarations under oath of Liliy that you have
asked her hand in marriage.
I have seen, furthermore, all the telegrams
whicn you have scut daily since your depart
ure from here until your arrival in London,
and about a dozen letters wnich you have
written the gin when here. Furthermore, I
have seen several of your i>hotographs, and.on
the back of the one given to the mother is
written, "A mi mama." There is no doubt
thai the letters were writ. en and signed by
yourself, but I presume the telegrams were
written by Ribas.
The matter iooks very compromising, and I
desire that you give me all ihe information
and dates which you have by first mail, and
send me, also, all the letters you have from
the girl, and other papers and details which
touch on the subject) to see how we can avert
the storm.
I had another interview to-day with these
four lawyers and they demanded $20,000 gold
to abandon the lawsuit. It is an act of slander
and that man Ribas is at the bottom of it all.
I have promised the lawyers to write you and
they promised me in return that the matter
would rest quietly until 15th May next to
Know what you would write to me on the sub
ject. I am doing all that is possible that noth
ing will get out in the newspapers and hope
I will succeed. Immediately I have taken the
advic- of the best criminal lawyer here. In
case it does come to a lawsuit ihe lawyer is
sure to send to prison Mr. Ribas, as well as the
lawyers beiore they go much farther.
You know I am your good friend and will do
everything possible to get you out of this dif
ficulty without any blemish. I have to add
that you should consider the matter very seri
ous, because it is sure taat while your absence
will save you immediate trouble, these knaves
will establish a lawsuit and in your absence
you will be obliged to defend yourself, other
wise they will take judgment by default. This
will be a charge asany othercharge, and judg
ment can be made against your properties in
GÂ»mt emaia.
Whctner this is so or not, I don't know. For
that reason do not forget to give me all the
particulars you have which 1 nave asked you,
as those bandits will establish a lawsuit.
In my opinion If it would be only a matter
of a few thousand dollars to recover tho>e let
ters, telegrams and pictures it would not
amount to much, but 1 would rather spend
double the amount of money to defeat this
band of rascals and not permit them to be
smirch your name and character in this city.
Ail your friends here know it is a matter of
slander, and your reputation will not suffer;
but in case you allow yourself to be made the
Victim of these individuals now, to-morrow,
perhaps, some other girl will not be lacking
with similar pretensions. Write me with the
greatest detail by first stenmer and tell me
everything. Do not conceal or foreet any
thing, because I muet know absolutely every
thing.
Did Lillie know that you desired her as
your companion, or was she under the belief
that you intended to marry her? Write me
extensively, and on receipt of this letter send
me a cable telling me what I should do. I
propose that you sand for Don Florentine
aud Don Perento and consult with them. You
know they are just as loyal friends of yours
as I am. Do iiot worry much about it,
because with a little bit of care these knaves
can't do anything. I prefer to tight with
them rather than pay them one single cent;
but I am of the opinion that it would be
convenient to spend something to get the let
ters, telegrams and photographs, so that girl
does not use same against you.
I am going to send this letter to Florentine,
and shall beg ol him to send same to you
through some confidential man, or that he
carry the same to you himself, beceuse I
don't know where you may be found. You
may rest assured I will do all in my power to
avoid publicity of this matter, but I fear the
newspapers will succeed in getting it. I hope
tnis will find you well, and I remain your
friend, Louis Hirsch.
Attorneys Dimond, Ach and Thornton
declare that Miss Blair, her sister and
her motlier were bought off, to speak
plainly, and it was alone these lines that
Hirscn's examination proceeded yester
day. The agent of Barillas resented such
insinuations as far as be was concerned.
The repartee between tne lawyers was
almost as warm as the weather. Attorney
Patrick Redciy's presence denoted that
Barillas thinks the matter of enough im
portance to empioy two firms of lawyers.
It was Ribas who brought the Blairs to
Hirsch first. The interview took place In
the Occidental restauranr. Between sobs
and tears Mrs. Blair, Mrs. Ph ill ids and
Miss Blair told him how they had con
spirea witn Dimond to blackmail Barillas,
who, Mrs. Blair declared, "had been a
regular angel to them." Hirsch turned
the women over at once to his attorneys,
Eisner & Reinslein. They were asked to
swear to their statements, and promised
to cease all persecution of Barillas.
Ach desired to get the details of what
Mrs. B air and her dauehters had told
Hirscb. The particulars oi the affidavits
mad- by the mother and daughters were
not exploited to any great extent
"Did Miss Biair say to you that she
knexall tee time Barillas was not mar
ried and that her mother knew of the true
relations with her?"
This Hirsch declined to answer.
"Did Miss Blair swear that xhe will
ingly became the companion of Barilla
and that her mother mid bister knew of
her voluntary relation?"
Eisner refused to allow his client to
answer any questions of this nature.
Dimond will have an inning on the wit
nesa-itand in his own behalf to-day.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 20, 1897.
DOGS ON PARADE
BEFORE JUDGES
The San Francisco Kennel
Club's Initial Show in
the Pavilion.
A Pack of Fifty English Fox
hounds Attracts Much
Attention.
The Canines That Were Decorated
With Blue, Red and White
Ribbons-
It was ladies' day yesterday at Mechan
ics' .Pavilion, that is, judging from the
number of beautiful women who attended
the initial day of the dog show.
The gathering was not very large during
the afternoon, but toward evening the
crowds parsed through the doors leading
into the Pavilion and the officers of the
San Francisco Kennel Club felt conse
quently elated over the success that will
crown their efforts.
The judging commenced sharply at 10
o'clock, and by 6 o'clock many of the
classes represented on the benches had
been judged.
The judges. Messrs. Oldham and Taylor,
reversed in many instances the decisions
of Judge Mortimer, which gentleman
judged the Oakland bench show.
The coursing men were surprised that
White Cloud, a winuer in Oakland, re
ceived only third place under Taylor.
But the men most prominently connected
with the sports of the lash allowed that
Judge Taylor's selection of toe beautiful
little bitch Senorita as the best of a very
aristocratic claes of "flyers'' that paraded
before him proved that he thoroughly un
derstood the qualities of a greyhound.
Tne St. Bernards were numerous, but
only a small number of the Jogs which
appeared in the ring was worthy of any
special mention. Some of the best breu
doj;s were very poor of coat.
The deerhounds were few. In fact, the
only real good specimen was a dog named
Derby.
The American foxhounds manifested
some slight improvement over the ones
that were exhibited at the last bench
show held in this City. The best breeds
represented in the show are setters, point
ers and cocker spaniels.
The fox terriers are good, but the same
cannot be said of the bull terriers, which
are a very commonplace lot of fighter*.
The little dogs which are benched on
the south side of the hall are of all breeds
and colors. They attract the attention of
the ladies, but the absence of aecora'ed
kennels this year is very noticeable. Evi
dently the club lias not offered any spe
cial inducements to the ladies this year
for kennel decorations.
Possibly the greatest attraction of the
show is the kennel of English foxhounds,
the property of Air. Hu. art. The dogs
thoroughly understand the commands of
their roaster, who may be called the
"whipper in." He stands in the center
of the "parade ground" and as he calls
the dogs by name they come from the
pack to receive a petting and then retire
at the sound of the whip to the stage,
which is sufficiently large to accommo
date the entire family when at rest. The
number of dogs in the pack is fifty and
they are used by their owner purposely to
hunt coyotes and foxes in San Mateo
County. Their kennel is at Burlingame.

FEATURES OF THE SHOW.
Society Casts an Approving Glance
at the Prize Dogs In the
Pavilion.
The dogs, may now bark with delight,
as society has deiened to cast an approv
ing glance on the inaugural show of the
San Francisco Kennel Club. The gallants
of the army and navy serve as the repre
sentatives of clubdom, and quite a good
sprinkling of professional men and mer
chants, accompanied by their ladies, paid
their respects to the canine family at the
Pavilion last niehr. 'Judging from the
attention bestowed on the St. Bernards
that strain of blood must be accepted as
the canine aristocracy.
The English setters, however, came in
for a larce share of admiration, and Sam
uel P. Hughes* champion, Siver Plate,
received no end of compliments.
The greyhounds likewise had much at
tention, and Don, owned by H. M. N.
Spring of San Jose, bad many admiring
visitors. Don eained a prieÂ«.

Pavilion last night.
The rromoters of the show expressed
gratification over the large throng in
attendance, and predicted that the in
terest would increase.
There were many ladies present, so
many that they formed nearly half of the
throng of visitors. Street auits seemed to
predominate, although evening hati and
theater dress were quite noticeable.
Damage* for a Broken Lag.
Charles L. Koch has sued the Market-street
Railway Company for $31,000 damages. He
says one of the cars of the corporation came in
collision with his express wagon on the Bth
inst., throwing him to the ground, breaking
his leg in two places and otherwise bruising
him. Hence this suit.

The Heat Ties Up the Hyde-
Street Line for a Short
Time.
A Sagebrush Disorder Ciuses an Ex
alted Temperature on tbe
Coast.
Tbe weather sharp slipped his pins yes
terday, with a result that tbe mercury set
a dizzy pace for tbe record mark. Some- j
where up in Nevada there was a lo w pres- j
sure, such aB pushed the San Joaquin |
Valley temperature over on the coast, and
for some hours matters were jumbled
hopelessly up.
San Francisco KOt under the blowpipe
early in the day and at 10 o'clock tbe 90
degree line on thermometers was in sight.
At noon the 88 mark nad been reacned,
and there the mercury loitered until tbey
let go in Nevada and gave the ocean
winds a chance at the game. Still it was
warm as anybody wished. What wind I
there was had a playful trick of tossing
little eddies about to clog the already
overworked bronchial tubes of "pedes
trians. :_â.>â ,;â;- 'Â?>-!;Â« -
How hot it was in the sunshine nobody
will dare conjecture. The conductors and
gripmen on the Hyde-street branch of the
Calitornia-street railway iiave their own
ideas on this subject, for did uot tbe heat so
expand the iron slot cieats at the crossing
of Hyde aiid SutUir streets as to actually
stop the line for some time.
. Tbe flagman . says the blockade was ac
tually tbe result of thia rather unheard of
accident. -
Reports from other places are all in the
same vein. Oakland went in its shirt
sleeves all day. San Josi, Stockton and
Sacramento bore the punishment meekly.
Now all days are caloric just at these
times in those places. . Portland and tbe
Sound country were in the swim as well.
-â  The prospects for to-day are not invit
ing. Tbings are still confused in Nevada
and until the Sagebrusbera get down to
tae reeular order of business it's best not
o be too sanguine.;
