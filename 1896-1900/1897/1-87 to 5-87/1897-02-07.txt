â  EARIb, Frakce, Feb. The Paris
â¢ press are greatly excited over the speech
! delivered in the British House of Com
mon's yesterday by Sir Michael Hicks-
Beach, Chancellor of the Excheauer, up
on the occupation of Egypt.
The Journal, in an article commenting
upon ihe speech, says: "The insolent
â¢ challenge thrown to France and Russia
ought to be taken up."
The Autorite says: "England disdains
and defies France and Russia and will
continue to do so until both of these pow
ers resort to the sword."
La Libre Parole says: "The reply to
England's challenge must be action, not
mere words."
â¢ BERLIN, Germany, Feb. 6.â Officials
/ and newspapers regard the renewed strain
between France and England with com
; plete equanimity, and the declarations
â¢ concerning Egypt cade by Sir Michael
. Hickjs-Beach, tne British Chancellor ot
j â¢ the Exchequer, in the House of Commons
â  in London yesterday are attributed to
â¢ tnat gentleman's knowledge that England
has the support of Germany, Austria and
. Italy in regard to her occupation of
Bzypt.
Tire Hamburg correspondent in an
article on the subject gives expression to
the opinion generally entertained in Ber
. ]in when it sayÂ» that France h.is no It-pat
I Tight to force England to evacuate Egypt.

1 EsÂ»ypt fhe St. Petersburg NovoeVfemya
says that Russia intends, to, con line her
self to placing tne Suez canal under in
""' ternational control, otherwise sue has no
interest in. Egypt.
Speaking of the attitude of the Austro-
Hnngarian Government, the Pesther
' L-loy.d, in an inspired communication from
Vienna, expresses regret that the line of
the Franco-Russian entente menaces the
concord of the powers at the very time
when a perfect harmony is most urgently
needed.
"The effect will likely be," the paper
adds," to defeat a solution of the difficul
ties in Turkey and we must now exert
â¢ every effort to restore the harmony of the
relations between France and Great
Entain."
The adhesion of Germany and Italy to
the policy, it was hoped, would lead to
the abatement of the English aggressions
. in Ihe Transvaal, but reports from Pre
toria announce the occasion of a severe
split bstween Dr. Leyds, the Secretary of
State of ihe South African Republic, ana
President Kruger. which advices furnish
: an explanation 01 the reported intention
'â ' of Dr. Leyds to resign his office. Dr.
Leyds has a Jarge number of followers,
and, according to the dispatches, the
prediction is freely made that he will
obtain a Boor majority in favor of the in
dependence of the Transvaal Republic or
such a revision of the Ane'o-Boer Con
vention as will give the Transvaal Govern
ment absolute coutroi over its foreign re
lations.
The Vossiche Zeitung published a dis
patch from its correspondent in Pretoria
which says the fort works which have
been in course of construction around the
Boer capital are now being pushed for
ward to completion with feverish haste
' Jend also that distrust of the English is in-
everywhere in the Transvaal and
â  '& rapidly increasing war feeling has set in.
Dr. Koch, the eminent German bacteri
ologist, has telegraphed that he is return
ing with a newly discovered serum which
will lessen the force of the rinderpest. In
â¢ the meantime, he says, he is unaole to
â¢ say whether he will be able to prevent
animals from being infected with the dis
ea-e. He has demonstrated that sheep
and home 1 cattle are the most liable of
ail animais to contract the disease, and
that dog?, monkeys and rodents enjoy
complete immunity from it. Dr. Koch
wire* that be is not going to Bombay to

there, desuite the fact that he has been
asked to head the commission which is to
be sent to Bombay for that purpose.
â¢ The speeches delivered in the Reichstag

the bes-t he has ever made, and have won

Outbound Steamer* Come to Anchor off
Quarantine.
NEW YORK. X. V., Feb. 6. -A West
Indian storm which has been working up
the coast for some days arrived here at
coon to-day. The wind came out frost
The San Francisco Call
the east, with premonitions of more to
come, and then rain began to fall. By
evening the wind had registered a velocity
of 60 miles an hour and the steady down
rour of rain had amounted to a little over
half an inch.
The Washington weather bureau sent
out a notice that dangerous northeast
sales were due along this and the New
England coast and that shipping should
be held in port. Hurricane signals were
ordered here to-day and as a consequence
several outbound steamers came to anchor
off Quarantine to wait for better weather.
Before midnight a small fleet had gathered
there.
REV. DR. BOLTON'S SAD CASE.
Peculiar Hallucination That Causes Him
to Separate From His Wife and
Leave Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., Fob. 6.â The South
Park Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church
is without a regular pastor on account of
the departure of Rev. H. W. Bolton under
peculiar circumstances. Bishop Merrill
of the diocese, who understands the de
tails of the trouble, said to-day :
"A separation between Rev. Dr. Bolton
and his wife has been arranged. He be
lieves his wife has attacked his moral
character with regard to six or seven
women, ana if I were to tell you who they
were you would at once see that his delu
sion would be laughbable if it were not so
sad. His wife has never doubted him in
the least and has protested to me and
others that she had never for a moment
questioned her husband's purity, much
less impugned it to him or to any one else.
"She says he is subject to these mental
lapses, and will come out this time as he
has before, and then will not even remem
ber anything he has said on the subject.
It is possible that events may so abapc
themselves that an investigation of the
rumors JJr. Bolton has given currency to
may not be necessary. His physical and
mental condition is such that there is no
prospect of his return to South Pars Av
enue Church."
Rev. Dr. Bolton has gone South and
will deliver occasional lectures. His wife
is in South Bend, Ind. Dr. Bolton has
been prominent in church, Grand Army,
Masonic and other secret circles for years.
He was chaplain durincr the Civil War, is
past commander of U. S. Grant Post and
State chaplain of the P. O. S. A., and a
thiriy-third degree Mason. He has always
been in demand as a patriotic orator.
MONITOR PURITAN UNSEA WORTHY.
Many of the Valves Found to Be Leaky
and Pumps Used to Keep Out
the Water.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 7.â A morning
paper says: Still another vessel of the
United States navy 1 as been found unsea
worthy. It is the monitor Puritan, tbe last
one added to the list of vessels available
f>r service. Tne Puritan was to have left
the navy-yard next Tuesday to join the
fleet in command of Admiral Bunce off
Charleston hurbor.
The engines were given a dock trial a
few days ago and it was then discovered
that they did not work smoothly. Many
of the valves were found to be leaky. Toe
valves connecting the outboard aelivery
pipes with the condensers are also liak
ing and the pumps have been working for
tlxe last two weeks in order to keep the
vessel free from water. Men from tbe
construction department have been mak
ing repairs, but it will be some time be
fore they are completed, and the vessel
will not be able 10 join the squadron for
about two weeks.
The engines worked roughly in the trial,
and in less than fifteen minutes smoke
came from the journals. They were taken
apart and the iittings were found to be
badiy burned. They were sent to the
steam engineering shops, where new ones
will be made.
One of the officers attached to the ship
said yesterday:
"We found that the valves connecting
with the pipes leading to the outside of
the ship leaked to such an extent that It
was accessary to keep the small pumps

caused by the packing in the valves. It

repaired within the next few days."
THEINDIANA'S ERRATIC CONDUCT
Captain Taylor Makes a Detailed Report
and the Navy Department dyes
Out a Statement
WASHINGTON, D. C Feb. 6.â Captain
Henry C. Taylor's detailed report upon
the performance of the battle-ship In
diana in heavy weather rff Hatteras,
which caused him to leave Admiral
Bunco's squadron and seek safety in
Hampton Roads, reached the Navy De
partment late this afternoon.
It appears that the fcur eight-inch gun
turrets, weighine abont 150 tons each,
under the strain of the vessel's rolling
were found to move laterally one-eightu
o/an inch wilh the ship's motion, and
that the two thirteen-inch gun turrets,
weighing about 500 tons each, moved lat
erally one-quarter of an inch under the
same influences.
One of the latter turrets, when Captain
('â¢Fighting Bob") Evans tODk the ship
into a storm last fall, revolved bodily
through a greater portion of the arc, but
in the breeze of the day before yesterday
they did not get loose from the ei'ra fast
enings that had been applied during the
winter's stay at the New York Navy-yard.
The infinitesimal lateral movement, that
the naval officials attribute to the neces
sary flexibility cf the vessel, alarmed the
ship's officers, who signaled Admiral
Bunce and secured his pivmisiion to seek
the nearesthaven.
From the character of the storm encoun
tered off Hatteras the officials deduce the
opinion that the vessel exhibited stanch
ness in a remarkable degree and they as
sert the opinion that no suffer battle-ship
of such weight as the Indiana and her
ciass is possessed by any navy.
Tlie Navy Department has decided to
withhold tne official report from publica
tion, but Assistant Secretary McAdoo gave
out the following statement:
The report of Captain Taylor, with reference
to the behavior of the Indiana, has just been
received. The officers ol the ship, as appears
from the report, owing to the former trouble
with the locking devices of the turrets when
the ship was subjected to heavy rolling, were
exceedingly cautious and observant as to the
action of the improved devices put on at Jsew
York.
So far as the report states the new device
i did not give way in any part nor develop any
i permanent, deformity, but when the snip
rolled rather heavily in the trough of the sea
there was a slight play in the device observ
ant, the whole movement not exceeding a
I quarter of an inch, which was eonflned al-
I most entirely to the torward 13-Inch turret
i It iÂ» quite probab.e that had there not been
i unfavorable i-xperience with the old device
j this wouid not have been observed.
This very glighi movement of the turrets
was readily checked by setting up the bolts,
j which are very heavy, being four iuehes in
' diameter and far in excess of tbose formerly
i used. There was a heavy swell running into
j the trough, into which the ship was thrown
Eg to her course, and Captain Taylor in
ed Admiral Bunce by signal of the fact
this slight movement of the turrets was
rvant. and that he feared under continu
ous rolling It might iucrease ana carry away
the locking device.
After some messages had passed between
them the Indiana was directed to return to
the roads. She had no trouble on the way
back, and, indeed, it is certain that were she
free-handed and not subject to squadron re
strictions as to movements she could navigate
in any kind of sea or weather.
So far as the report shows, the locking
mechanism is in good condition, but Con
structor Stahl of the Norfolk yard baa been
ordered to inspect and report on the same.
s.aiy Smith and Peddler fainter.
NEW YORK. N. V., Feb. 6.â A cable
gram has bean received by Arthur Lum
ley from the manager or the National
Sporting Crub of London, England, offer
ing a purse of $2500 for a 20-round bout
between Solly Smith and Peddler Palmer,
to take place on Derby night. Palmer de
mands a $2500 side bet. Bmith has ac
cepted the terms and will sign articles as
soon as they reach here.
REFUSE TO ACCEPT
PROMISED REFORMS
Cubans in Arms Not Yet
Ready to Submit to
Spain.
Gomez and Garcia Will Not
Meet the Eivoys Sent Out to
Treat for Peace.
In a Sp-ech Weyler Declares the
Estab isnment of Reforms Depends
Upon Triumph of Arms.
KEY WEST, Fla., Feb. 6.â Advices
from Havana state tnat Canovas' fatuous
Cuban reforms nave been current talk
among the people during th- week. The
Cabinst crisis on accountof deprecintion in
paper money and war issues are laid aside
to discuss this important event.
Aitbongh the Government stops the
publication, the facts have leased out and
have been widely commented on. The
very fact that the authorities prevented
the printing of the news has Riven occa
sion to the people to express doubts and
misgivings of the efticacy of tie reforms.
The consensus of opinion of enlightened
Liberal Spaniards is tnat although the re
forms are sullicientiy ample to satisfy
their aspirations, the fact of their pro
mulgation by the Conservatives, who have
always opposed any concessions and who
not many months ago openly declared
tbeir policy "Guns â not reforms," in
clines them to hesitate.
As to the Cubans, it need not be said
that, with the exception of the renegades,
uil agree that the reforms are too weak
and certainly unacceptable to Cubans in
arms.
Reliable information states that Gomez
flatly refused to meet Marcos Garcia, the
delegate sent by the Government to make
proposals of peace. Gcmez would not
hear of any overtures or receive any com
munications tending to open negotiations
unless based upon absolute independence.
Another delegate appointed to en to
Mar.zanillo to talk with Caiixto Garcia de
clined the commission on the spot by say
ing, it was useless.
Gaoper Betancourt's confinement, de
spite the decision of the court for imme
diate release, is the greatest outrage ever
done an American citizen. The case ha->
not a precedent. On the contrary, Span
ish law requires that as soon as a prisoner
is found guiltless he be released on t lie
spot. Tbe proof is that the Judge, as
soon as the tribunal gave sentence, at
once signed a warrant ordering thn jail
warden to place him at liberty, conse
quently his remaining iv jail under the
alleged formalities to be complied with is
simply a flagrant violation of Spanish
law and a shameful injustice to an inno
cent man.
HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 6.â When Cap
tain-General Weyler reached the ouiskins
of the city of Santa Clara, where he ar
rived to-day, a delegation of prominent
residents of the city went out to receive
him and presented him with an address.
General Weyler replied to the address and
aruonc other things said:
"I am disposed to finish the rebellion at
once in the Santa Clara province. Those
speaking about reforms most know that
the Government hat published them and
given the subject thorough study, but the
establishment of these reforms depends
upon tbe triumph of the Spanish arms."
The Government has askÂ«d tbe Su
preme Court to furnlsbit with a copy of
the military proceedings against the
American citizens, George Aguirre,
Estaban Gregory and Lorenzo Vives, all
of whom are charged with taking part in
the rebellion.

Cuban Shnrpthooier. r^v';\>:?v
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 6.â A . special
to: the ; NÂ«w York \Vorld from Key West,,
Fia., says: As ' " General .Weyler.^.was
marching with bis columns just before
entering Santa Clara his horse was shot
from under him by a. Cuban sharpshooter.
It is supposed the shot came from a dis
tant hillside. â¢ â  â â¢â â ' \ â â â 
Throughout the march from Rodas the
Captain-General was assailed by missiles
of this kind, and several times barely
escaped being wounded.
He is greatly worried over it, and Jarge
scouting parties precede the advancing
Spanish columns to capture the daring
marauders.
A Spanish force of 503 men was am
bushed Wednesday nigbt near Nazarene,
just west of Santa Clara, where General
Weyler was then and narrowly escaped
annihilation.
The insurgents had rained the road and
bridge over a creek and hid on the road
sides.
As the Spaniards were crossing the
bridge mines were exploded, killing
twenty or thirty men and wounding many
more. The blowing up of the tridge di
vided the Spanish force. The Cubans
fireu on those in the rear and then they
charged with machetes. Many Spaniards
were driven into the creek, where they
were drowned.
The soldiers in the rear column just
managed to escape annihilation.
The Cubans captured fifty prisoners,
and report over 100 Spaniards killed,
drowned or wounded and missing. The
Cuban loss was slight.

Qentrnl Gome* Jtoubta the Sincerity of
th* Spanish Government. â¢ :'â¢'â¢ â 
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 7.â A special
dispatch to the Herald from Havana,
Cuba, February 6 (via Key West, Fla.),
says: General Weyler's attempt to ar
range for a secret conference with General
Gomez in Santa Clara over the question of
the proposed Cuban reforms has proved a
complete fizzle.
General Gomez sent word. It ia said,
that he would not confer with General
Weyler upon any subject whatever, and
refused to meet nim under any circum
stances.
While the rebel leader doubted the sin
cerity of the Spanish Government and de
clared that the proposed reforms would not
be promulgated in good faith he expressed
a willingness to meet any accredited agent
of the Government except Captain-Gen
eral Wfcyler, for the purpose of giving the
insurgent views upon the question.
The news of General Gomez's refusal to
treat with General Weyler caused intense
excitement to-day in official and political
circles.
OEfH ESAL XOLOFF DISMISSED.
IHfticult to Convict Member* of the Cuban
Junta in Aeto Ion;.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 6.-General
Carlos Roloff, Secretary of War of the
Cuban Provisional Government, and Dr.
Jose J. Luis were arraigned to-day in
Commissioner Shields' office, the com
plaint being made on two warrants re
quiring them to appear in Baltimore lor
trial to answer charges of conspiracy, and
"aiding and abetting" in connection with
tbe expedition which left Baltimore for
Cuba in July, 1895. They furnished $3503
bail each.
Assistant United States District Attor
ney Heinmann consented to the dismissal
of charges against General Koloff pre
ferred in tiiis city in connection with the
nibustering expedition on the steamship
Woodali, which occurred in 1895, and con
sented to Dr. Luis' release upon his own
recognizance in the same case.
The hearing ol the charges against Dr.
Luis and Editor Enrique TrujiUo to the
effect that they wero concerned in the
steamship Horsa expedition was set for
to-day, but the lawyer who appeared for
them waived examination before Commis
sioner Shields and the matter goes before
the Federal court.
On Monday next at 11 'clock Assistant
United States Attorney Heinmann will
move before Justice Brown in the United
States criminal court lor the removal of
General Roloff and Dr. Luis to Baltimore.
It is very generally believed that this
formality will ena all legal proceedings
against Cuban patriots in the United
States courts in this city, as in no instance
has conviction been obtained here.
Tne holding of the Luis and Trujillo
cases in abeyance is regarded as mere
formal proceedings. Ttiere is a belief
among prominent Cnbans in this city that
a sensational move against tbe Junta is in
contemplation by the Spanish authorities.
Just what form they anticipate it will
take they will not say.

MORTON, RÂ±ID OH DEPEW?
Triangular Fight for Embassador to Eng
land That M y Leave N.w York
Out of the Cabinet.
NEW YORK, N- V., Feb. 6.-New York
Republicans have by no means given up
hope that this State will be represente I in
Mr. McKinley's Cabinet, but they admit
that one or two complications have arisen.
The principal one arises out of the fight
for the embassy to England, which is
coveted by Levi P.. Morton and Whitelaw
Reid, while Depe 1 - has been promised
the support of the Republican organiza
tion for the same plo.ee.
The organizatioa of the State has no
objection whatever to the appointment o;
General Horace Porter to be Embassador
to France.
McKiuley would like to have Cornelius
N. Blis>, and some of the friends of Bliss
indotse General Woodford for Attorney-
General. It was declared that Mr. Bliss
does not desire to do this, and that General
Porter and Anson G. McCook and others
of Mr. B.iss' friends sustain him in the
position. The foregoing is the situation
which confronts the Republican organiza
tion of the State, and in view of the
alleged opposition of Cornelius N. Bass to
General Woodford, it .may be decided
within a day or two by the Republican
organization to drop General Woodford
and concentrate on Representative
Sherman, although it is stated on the
authority of Chairman O' Dell of the Ex
ecutive Siate Committee that Mr. Sher
man is not a candidate apainst Mr. Wood
ford.
The situation, according *o well-in
formed New York Republicans, is not a
pleasant one. The complication over the
Err.ba3=adorship to England, it is said,
will leave an unpleasant taste in the
mouths of many Republicans, and it wa>
added that the decision about this great
place of Embassador to England will
haye very much to do witii th*Â» selection
of a New York Republican for McKinley's
Cabinet.

When Secretary of State Brown this

of McCalvy's trip to Bakersfield to sell
his services on behalf of the coyote bounty
claims he immediately demanded the
resignation of the bookkeeper. In response
to this McCalvy at once wrote the follow

In the Senate the report of the Finance
Committee on the coyote-bounty claims
brought on a brief but somewhat heated
debate. The majority report recom
mended that the bi.l be passed, while the
minority rej ort read as follows:
â¢In view ot information recently re
ceived we respectfully report and recom
mend that the bill De retained in com
mit, cc lor further investigation."
Senator Yoorheis moved that the bill be
referred back to the committee for fur
ther investigation.
Senator Smith, one of the members of
the Finance Committee who voted in
favor of the bill, objected to its being re
ferred unless it retained its place on the
file, adding: "I have no desire to inter-
lere with the committee making such an
investigation aa it sees lit, but I would not
like to nee the bill lose its place on the

Senator Wolfe advocated the re-refer

Senator Withington objected to the pro
posed course, saying: "It seems to me

Tiie same stories were prevalent here at
the last session. If the minority of the

to its goinr over."
Senator Bulla moved the adoptiou of
the majority report, which was seconded
by Smith.
Senatcr Withington stated that i:i his
opinion the Ciaiuia contained in the bill
were honest, and the State should no
longer delay paying them.
Senator Woife, ile:ending the minority
report, spoke as follows:
"1 don't Know wh:\t the old sore s have
been, bv.t I do know tnat sufficient in
formation has come to the knowledge of
the committee to warrant it to make an
investigation, notwithstanding it has al
ready gone through the hands of the com
mittee. The place for such an investiga
tion is before tiie Legislature and not
before the Board of Examiners. We ap
propriate the money a.;ui we should hold
the investigation. There is an appropria
tion here that I am certain is not en
tirely honest."
Senator Smith stated that the Board of
Examiners, had made a thorough examina-
tion of the mater, and added: "I am not
here to defend one solitary claim in con
nection with the coyote scalps, but I de
sire to see honest people get what is hon
estly due them."
The majority report was adopted by a
vote of VZ to 9, and Bulla moved that the
bill be recommitted for further investiga
tion. It was so ordered.
Between now and Monday Senator
"Wolfe will prepare a resolution to be sub
mitted to the Senate, giving the Senate
riuauce Committee power to subpena wit
nesses, administer oaths and take testi
mony in this matter.
Bookkeeper McCalvy made the following
statement to-day in reference to the mys
terious and uusuccessiul pilgrimage "to
Bukersfield:
'1 did not know there was any ona here
looking out for the Kern County people.
I went to Bakerstieid unbeknown to any
one, as I supposed. Tnere was nothing
said about any corruption fund, it was
understood that the money 1 was to get
w:is to go to attorneys for the preparation
of papers, the introduction of a bill and
forappesring be.'ore committees and to
attention to tLe claims until they
were paid by tne Slate. Until that time I
was not to receive a dollar if they did not
leel dis: oied to pay me tue percentage. I
was willing to advance ihe money for this
proposition. lea 1 , mated th:ii the expense
would be between $4000 and $3000. I never
mentioned tLe matier to any member of
.the feenate or Assembly either before I
went or since ray return, I was unsuccess
ful and dropped the matter. I now want an
investigation."
In response to questions McCalvy said
that he had never Drought the fact df his
being connected with the Secretary of
State's office to the attention of any of the
Bakerslieid people. He added, however,
that many of the people there knew him
and that i;e was employed in that office.
Continuing, he said: "I saw nothing
wrong in 'the matter. It struck me as a
good business proposition. Attorneys ap
pear before these committees every duy.
Secretary Brown did not know I was go
ing to Bakersiiyld. I made up my mind
suddenly on fcur.day afternoon and caught
the 5 o'clock tram. I sent a Yeroal mes
sage to Brown that I would not be in the
office. He referred to my trip for the first
time yesterday afternoon, when he asked
ice why I went to Bakersfietd. I told him
1 went on personal business.
'â¢These scalp claims are held by two or
three bankers and merchants in" Bakers
tifld, that is, the Kern County coyote
claims. They aggregate something more
than $SO,OiX), and I understand that the
law firm of Freeman & Bates of San Fran
cisco hold $100 000 worth of them. One of
the principal things that I proposed to do
ior the people l was to represent was to
Introduce a bill which would obviate tbe
necessity of proving the validity of the
scalp receipts held by them. The measure
nov,- before the .Legislature provides that
each claimant must prove the validity of
his receipt or receipts, and that tuey were
not obtained by fraudulent practice or
imposition."
McCalvv was a resident of San Luis
Obispo until six years ago, when he en
tered upon the duties of Deputy Clerk of
the Supreme Court at San Francisco,
under Brown, who was then Clerk of that
tribunal. When Brown was elected Secre
tary of State McCalvy accompanied him
to this city to fill the position of book
keeper in his office.

Kern County Hankers and Officials Talk
Aboui Coyote Scnl-pt.
BAKERSFIKLD, Cal ., Feb. 6.â "So far
as lam concerned, I know of no scandal
whatever counected with the coyote scalp
business. I came into possession of my
cemhcates in a perfectly straightforward
manner." Thus spoke Charles Bicker
dike, assistant cashier of the Kern Valley
Bank, by way of reply to the information
thai the Senate is going to investigate the
coyote scandal. "I bought the certificates
from the men, who duly and regularly de
livered the scalps lo the Supervisors.
That is all I know about it." Mr. Bicker
dike is interested in the scalp tie-up to the
tune of a lew thousand dollars. Other
gentlemen who are thus interested spoke
regarding t!ie affair as did Mr. Bickerdike.
H. A. blodget, cashier of the Kefn
County Bank, who is said to be the most
heavily interested of this county, is out
of town, and therefore could not be seen
regarding the ma{ter.
"I was a member of the Board of Super
visors Id 1893 94, when the bu<k of coyote
scalps were received," said Supervisor
Jastro, "and the only thing we discovered
in all this time that cou.d be construed
into crookedness was that they would try
to palm off on us wildcat scalps once ia a
while and now and then try to make two
out of one. The men would bring the
scalps to us, make the required altidavit
in return, receive their receipts and go on
about their business."
"Did you ever think from the number
of scalps that would come In from time to
time that there were a good many coyotes
in the county?"
"Yes, I did; but everything came in
straight so far as we could see, and that
ended our duty."
Supervisor Taylor, who was also on the
board at that time, corroborated Mr.
Jastro. He, too, at times was surDrised at
the number of coyotes to be found in the
county. It was the custom of the board
to make a public burning of these scalps
every moatn. Edgar Moore during his
career of expertiug in this county Uiscov
eted a "mare's nest" in connection with
the coyote business, and in consequence
recommended the indictment of two par
ties by the Grand Jury. The indictments
were returned, but like most the others
that Moore figured in, were swept aside
by the Superior Court as being too flimsy
to come to trial.

touched upon in the Senate to-day. Voor

Committee, signed by five members,
recommending that the bill pass. He
asked that the Dill be sent back to the
committee for further investigation.
Smith objected, saying he was not op

report to remain on file.
Wolfe declared that an investigation
was absolutely demanded.
Withington objected to further delay.
He thought the bill should be paid.
W life agreed that the honest claims
should be paid, but he believed some of
the claims presented were not honest.
Smith said the bill gave the Board of
Examiners too great power, but many
honest claims were involved and should be
sealed.
Bulla moved that the report be adopted
in order to retain its place on the file.
Adopted, 12 to 9. Bulla then moved to re
commit the claims to the Finance Com
mittee for investigation, which was also
agreed to. The investigation will begin
Monday.
Holloway, from the Committee on At

Coombs spoke in favor of his resolution.
|He believed that tbe Assembly was
: anxious to rconomiz* in the matter of its
attaches, and he hoped thnt there would
j be no opposition to the adoption of the
j resolution. It would cut down the ex
penses of the Assembly from $100 to $300

Dibble favored the resolution, but

In explanation of this amendment, he
j said that he did not favor granting to any

"These attaches came here and succeeded |

Contrivances for Jieqi*irr\nrj Ballots for
the Jnnpeetlon of Legislator*.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 6.â There
are four voting machines on exhibition
here in the Capitol, all Ca'ifornian inven
tions, none of them using electricity and
three of them requiring the voter to open
a door or to turn a stile before the ma
chine unlocks itself. The fourth differs
from the three others mater-ally. The
voter, pressing upon a button, punches a
hole in a ticket opposite the name of his
candidate, and at the close of the polls
those holes are counted by the election
officers. The : other machines . register
each vote after the fashion of a cash regis
ter; two of them â the Ducas and the
Capitalâ show the totals on wheels for
each candidate, but the Ellis machine,
immediately on the close of the polls,
prints -the total received by each candi
date in triplicate.
If California, in experimenting with
voting machines, is to follow the methods
of the Eastern States which have legal
ized their use, the present Legislature will
approve one or more of â¢ the inventions
and make a law for each such machine
adopted. For instance, Michigan, in 1893,
maae a law permitting "the Rhines vote
recorder, or any' other vote-recorder of
similar construction and principle," to be
used at all town, city and village elec
tions. At that same session the Michigan
Legislature passed, also, an act to allow
the use of "the Abbott automatic ballot
machine, or any other ballot machine ot
similar construction and principle" in all
to.vnship, city or village elections. These
two machines were thus legalized by sep
arate -nets, both of ' which were approved
by the Governor on the same day.
> Two years' later Michigan adopted a
third, the Myers ballot machine, as a
legal voting system, and passed an act
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, StXNDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1897.
which permits its use at ail elections in
the State. Here, then, is one State which
has legalized and is experimenting with a
number of automatic voting schemes.
In 1896 the Legislature of Connecticut
made two distinct voting machine laws,
one for the McTammany, the other for the
Myers machine. New York and Massa
chusetts have both approved the Myers
machine. In all these cases the enacting
clause specifically mentions the machine
for which tiie law is designed.
Upon close consideration of the subject
it becomes evident that it is impossible to
make one law govern a multitude of
voting systems. Eton machine has its
peculiar method of counting and canvass
ing and its own method and theory of
conducting an election, and the lav that
will put one into operation by the very
nature of things could not be adapted to
the purposes of another. If this is eood
logic and correct law the Legislature will
find it necessary when it makes any
voting machine law to carefully examine
the merits of the various machines of
fered, select one or more of the best, and
makÂ« for each a law that will permit its
use by such boards of municipal trustees
or county supervisors as may be pre
vailed upon to buy them or try them.
AAMtOUs' LICEXBB BILL.
Small Jtetttil Liquor n-aiert Oppose the
.Uraaure.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 6.â Senator
Androus to-day introduced what is evi
dently the Code Commission's bill in ref
erence to a State license on all saloons.
It provides for a $300 annual license to be
paid to the State irrespective of county
and city licenses. It is understood that
the bill is generally opposed by the retail
liquor dealers throughout the State, but
has the support of some of the members
ol the California Protective Association,
the liquor dealers' State organization.
Those who are disposed to give the meas
ure a fair trial are mainiy the wholesale
liquor merchants w..0 believe that such a
license will tend to weed out many of the
objectionable smaller saloon-keepers.
They hope in this way to see the moral
standard of the business advanced, as
well as the liuancial status of the retailer.
On tne part of those who are opposed to
the measure it is claimed that particular
hardship will be worked on ihe saloon
keepers of Alameda, San Diego, Los An
geles and other counties wherein the tax
on saloons is already high. The full text
of the proposed constitutional amend
ment follows:
The Legislature shell have no power to im
pose taxes upon counties, cities, towns or
other public or municipal corporations, or
upon the inhabitants or property thereof, for
county, city, town or other municipal pur-.
I poses; but may, by general law*, vest in tbe
corporate authorities thereof the power to as
, ses* and collect taxes for mk ii purpose.
t'rovided, however, that no person, firm or
! corporation shall transact, carry on, conduct
or eugage in the business of selling or vend
ing malt, v:uous or spiri' uous liquors without
first paying the sum of $300 to tbe State Treas
urer ot this state, who suull thereupon issue ft
license, to be couutersigned by the Stale Con
troller, to carry on and conduct such bunmet-s
at a place named in said license, and suid
license shall be valid for one year from its
date.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed
to abridge, deny or impair the right of couuty,
city and county, or other municipal corpora
tions to impose and collect license taxes on
such business, or to regulate for any purpose,
or to control, abolish or suppress trie utme,
No license shall \>o issued by ihe State Treas
urer to carry ou or conduct suid business witu
in the limits of any such municipality in
which tbe legislative body has declared by
I ordinance thai no license snail be lseucdf or
. such business, or that the same shall be
abolished or suppressed.
Violation of the act is made a rnisde

to-day, should become a law, streetcar
conductors will be no lousier required to
make a cash deposit, it is entitled "An

requiring deposits from employes." Cor
porations are commanded to return such
deposits within thirty days after tne pass
age of the act, ana a violation shall be
puni3hed by a line of $100 for eÂ»ch and
every offense.
This bill is by the author of the one for
the encouragement of {rambling on trot
ting horses in the summer time and for
the discouragement of gambling on run
ning horses in the winter, and is evi
dently an exhibition of fusion buncombe
for the benetit of the minority. No con
ductor or motorman would be so fooiish
as to ask for his deposit or to complain
if he did not receive it should the bill De
come a law, because he would t>e very

united, determined effort on the par: of
employes the bill would be inoperative.

CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 6.â Commander
riootli-Tucker and Colonel Brewer of the
Salvation Army will meet in this city
within two weeks to arrange the prelim
nariea for the establishment of a vast
system of social settlements similar to
that in operation in England, organized
by General Booth.
The venerable founder of the army will
come here when the preliminary work is
done, and after setting the great indus
trial and economic scheme in motion he
will leave it in the care of the American
officers mentioned. The establishment is
intended to be a crusade against poverty
in all its forms.
Chicago is to be the center of this sys
tem and its boundaries will be the United
States. City colonies are to be established,
where at least terrporary work will be
offered every idle man in the city; spaci
ous tenement houses are to be provided
under army supervision, and eventually
the colonies are to be extended within a
radius of several hundred miles from the
city.
President Harper of the Chicaeo Uni

professors, educators and philanthropists,
have taken an active interest in the mat

ARGUES FOR THE
UNION PACIFIC
Senator Thurston Continues
His Speech Against
Foreclosure. 1
What Would the Government
Do With the Road if
It Had It?
Must Take in the Central Pacific to
Have a Continuous Line to
the Golden Gate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, FeO. 6.â ln the
Senate to-day tne diplomatic and consular
appropriation bill was reported from the
Appropriations Committee by Hale (R.) of
Maine, who stated that be would call it
up Monday.
A resolution was offered \ y White (D.)
of California, and agreed to, calling on the
Secretary of the Treasury for a statement
as to the discontinuance of general bonded
warehouses.
A resolution was offered by Allen (Pop.)
of Nebraska, and agreed to, looking to the
prohibition of the acceptance of gilts by
army officers from private citizens for
services rendered.
Allen's resolution looking totbe suspen
sion and prohibition of the judiciul sale of
the Union Pacific Railroad property was
tasen up, and Thurston (R.) of Nebraska
re>umed bia speech against it. Thur3
ton said that in hia judgment the Union
Pac tic, under the receivers, had not been
making enough income to maintain the
property as it should be maintained and
to pay fair interest un the amount which
the reorganization committee proposed to
bid for the property.
As ne figured out the whole matter it
was this: If the Government took, the
1800 miles of the Union Pacific line it
vould hare to pay in cash out of the treas
ury over $50,000,000; if it got the terminals
it would have to pay fifteen or twenty mil
lions more for them, and, besides that, it
would have to forego the receipt of $29,
--000,000 in cash, malting an investment of
some eighty millions, equal to about
$45,000 per mile of railroad. And what,
he asked, would the Government do with
the road if it bad it? It would have to
extend the aame policy of purchase to the
Central Pacific, so as to have a line from
I Ogden to the Golden Gate.
At 2 p. m. the Nicaraeoa canal bill was
laid before the Senate as the unfinished
business.
Vilas (D.) of Wisconsin asked unani
mous consent that the bill go over in
formally to enable Thurston to continue
his speech, but objection was made by
Morgan (D. ) of Alaoama, in charge of the
bill.
This was resented by Thurston, who
said that he would ask consent to resume
his speech on Monday, and that as he re
ceived courtesy so should he {jive it.
The-Senate then proceeded to the con
sideration of uuobjected bills on the
calendar. Among others the following
werÂ» passed: Benate bill for the establish
ment and maintenance of a National Sol
diers' Home, at ilot Springs, S. D. ;
Senate bill to make Commodore William
P. McCann of the navy a rear-admiral on
the retired list; Senate bill regulating bell
and horn signals of steam and sailing ves
sels at sea; resolution (offered by i! organ )
relating to the capture of the Competitor
by a Spanish man-of-war, and requesting
the President to communicate to- the
Senate all the facts and proceedings;
Senate bill appropriating $12,000 to the
widow of Mr. Swift, formerly United
States Minister to Japan.
When Senator Cameron's joint resolu
tion acknowledging the independence of
Cuba had been reached on the calendar
the presiding officer (Hill) suggested good
humored ly that if there was no objection
the joint resolution would bÂ«s regarded as
passed. Objection was promptly forth
coming, and Morgan muved to proceed
with the consideration of the joint resolu
tion, notwithstanding the objection. Sub.
sequently he withdrew the motion, but
gave notice that he would reuew it on
every proper occasion.
At 3p. m. resolutions in honor of the
late Representative Cogswell were laid be
fore the Senate and eulogies were deliv
ered by Senators Hoar, Blancnard, Hans
brough, Qnllinger aiid Lodge, and ttien, as
a further mark of respect, the Senate ad
journed until Monday.

Slav Re Innocent.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 6.â The
impression that the inspectors of the
Postoffic* Department have made a mis
take in arresting Hamilton F. Colernan in
New York yesterday on the charge of
stealing uncanceled stamps used for bags
or seconu,-class mail matter is gaining
ground here in the official circles con
cerned. Tnis afternoon a conference with
regard to the case was held between Post-
master-General Wilson, Kerr Craige, the
third assistant Postmaster-General. Chief
Inspector Wheeler and Inspector Arring
ton, and while the result was not made
public it is believed that Coleman's
chances for release were improved by it.
Postoffice officials are discovering many
methods by which the stamps could get
into the posses-ion of individuals not con
nected with the department without any
recourse to criminal or otner illegal
methods. It- is said that retiring poÂ«t

masters frequently abstract periodical and
other stamps, cover up the matter in their
final reports and pay any deficiency out of
their own pockets.
Tbe Government loses nothing and there
tiring postmaster disposes of th*Â» Deriodi
cal stamps for an amount sufficient to
cover up his own contribution to the Post
office Department and perhaps makes
something extra. -
A. C. Townsend, the philatelist with
whom Coleman was interested, declares
Coleman is innocent and that proof of it
can b3 produced. Coleman's reputation
among his associates in the General Laud
Office is excellent.

Colonial Legislature IHstolred and a

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 6 âAdvices
received to-day from British Guiana at tbe
Bureau of South American Republics state
the colonial legislature has been dissolved
for the first time in five years and a gen
eral election ordered, which was to occur
January 20.
Before the la^t se=aion closed a resolu
tion was passed to pay Government Sur
veyor Harrison $9SO as part compensation
for his arrest several months apo by tbe
Venezuelans on the Acarabisci. This sum
is to be deduct; d from any indemnity for
the arrests that Venezuela hereafter may
make under pressure from the British
Government.
Some of the Legislature's members
questioned the Government as to the ex
act terms of the arbitration agreement,
and were informed that the Secretary of
State considered it undesirable to publish
the correspondence at this time.

WASHINGTON, D. C. Fdb. 6.âSena
tor Harris of Tennessee, who has been
quite ill in this city, had an operation
performed Jast night on one of bis eyes
which has given him great relief.
Whether the Senator will lose the sight
entirely of that eye the oculist would not
say, refusing to discuss the matter, but
it is probable that this will prove to be
the case, as it has been discovered that
the eye has been defective for two years
and gradually losing; its power of vision.

Plague Precautions
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 6.â As stated in
this cable correspondence last week Mr.
Dillon, the Irish leader, finds himself too
late in the field with his opposition to the
appointment of a new commission to ex
amine into the financial relations existing
between Great Britain and Ireland. If an
amendment regarding the subject Lad
been moved to the address in reply to the
Queen's speech it rnti^t have elicited from
tne Government some idea of iheir inten
tions as to tie scope of the commission
jiiid its probabie composition. The oppo
:>nion woul I thus have obtained some in
umaiion enabling them to take a definite
..neof attack against the Government's
i roposals. A.3 it is the scheme of the
Cabinet has been allowed to matare in the
dark and its discussion has only been
â accorded when the Government could not
help itâ that i*, on the Cabinet's proposals
being placed before the House of
Commons.
The commission will be empowered to
deal with a much wider range of inquiry
than was the commission of 1893. Its in
quiry will certainly last more than two
years, as was originally announced in this j
correspondence, and before the final re- \
j crt can be made to the House the Gov
ernment will be prepared to connect the
commission's finding with the corner
stone of their Irish reform policy â the lo
cal government o: Ireland bill ana the re
distribution of seats bill, the latter of
which will deprive Ireland of some thirty
seats in the imperial Parliament.
â  The Government at fast intended to
â  have only seven members constitute the
commission, but urgent representations
from the Irish iandlor.is, from tiie great
breweries and other interests will induce
them to enlarge the membership. Tiie
brewers, who have j?reat influence among
the Unionists and contribute largely to
the pjirty purse, fear that the suggested
increase in the duty on beer to balance a
Lie reduction in the duty on whisky
may lina support in the commis-iou.
Irish contention is that beer is unduly fa
vored.
Equalization wo.ild be a severe blow to
the brewing interests and to the English
â beer-drinkers, but wou.d bz a questionable
boon to ihe Irish whisky-drinkers.
The effect of Senator Wolcott's mission â 
in the interest o: bimetallism will only be |
known on his return to WasniaÂ»ion from
Karope. Tiie active birnetali ists in Par
\uneiH wtiom Mr. Woicott has seen hold
u'. tiie initiative for a new international
. onference should be taken by the United
Slates Government and ihat the confer
ence should met-; in Was inEton. The
members of the British Uimetallic Union
have been in communication with the
ctiief3 of Ihe German L Â«gue, who would
approve oi initial Ariiericiii action. Tne
Br tisb Government would undoubtedly
send representauve.- to Washington. Tae
idea 01 a. fresh con:erence at Brusse.s finds
n i favor in Enelisb monetary circles, as
the last conference held there was
'â¢uoiche'.i. :> It is feared t at if another
was held there it would have a precedent
in futility tuat would not pertain to a
Washington conference.
1 tie i>.i.on-Healy squabbles continue to
excite tne contempt of the Conservatives
and Liberals alike. The balance oi opin
. inn among the Liberals blames D.non,
Blake ana Davitt as having indiscreetly
Handled the Heaiyite trouble, especially
as regards the resolution touching the
payment of poor members of the party.
.Mere onlookers, whos- sympathies are
with Ireland and home rule, concur as to
the utter unwi-dom of tnesc brawls at &
time when the whole Irish fighung force
fi.oulu be concentrated on lorcing the
financial question toward a satisfactory
' eolutioi!.
London is to be fortified against a possi
ble invasion by forces landing on the
southern coast. The clan of lortworks
dates as far back a< the time of the i>uke
of Wellington, but has been revived by
Lord Wulseley and other military author
ities, and adapted to the changes of mol
ern warfare. T;:e military works Dill pro
vides for me construction of a chair, of
.â¢ fort wrrks from the Southern Djwiis to
the heights on the south of London, on
which the Crystal Palace is a conspicuous
object.
The sclieme includes barracks aad other
military works. The cost, wh eh will be
. something formidable f< r the treasury to
face, wil be met by advances from the
consolidated fund, to be repaid by instail
â¢ .ments extending over twenty years.
Tiie retirement ot Sir Julian Pauncefote
from the Wii-*h;iii;'6n embassy and lrom
âº ttie diplomatic serv;c<* will not take place

difficulties in the wjiy of acceptance of the
general arbitration treaty between Great
.Britain and the United States are over.
The removal 01 Sir Pnillin Carrie lrom
the embassy at Constantinople at no
future date is certain. It is no secret that
Lord Salisbury i-, dissatisfied with Sir

cur ?n his transfer to some other po>t. A
bhrhiy placed official of the Foreign Office

that the Cunio matter had been under

If a special envoy should be sent to as

Ihorities do not in the least fear the
plague.
l> tUe stand taken by the English dele
trates to the conference can be forecasted
from certain official statements heard here
it will be summed by contending i hat the
measures to check the spread of the epi
demic in India are as perfect as can ttc.
and that tho best protection against the
epidemic afflicting Europe will be greater
attention to cleanliness at th*> ports and
among the people of Europe. Put plainly,
the English delegates will suy : "Your
quarantine proposals are useless. Get
clean and the plague will not attack you.'
The notoriously unsanitary stale of Ital
ian towns, trie dirty habits of the people,
tlie filihinefs of the Russians, and the de
fects of sanitation in Austria and Ger
many, and even French centers, as com
pared with the English, will give ncir.t to
the English contention. Spasmodic sani
tation efforts were mÂ«de at the time of
the last cholera visitation in Germany.

since then tne international measures
have bet-n generally ignored.
The council of the social-democratic
federation is arranging a popular demon
stration over the Indian famine fund
scandals. There really seems to be a con
s-piracy of silence on the part of the lead
ing London papers regarding the misap
propriation of the vast sum of Â£17,000,000,
raised by additional taxation in India, to
provide for the inevitable recurring fam
ines. A circular issued by the socialist
council points out that this famine fund
was started on the hypothesis that every
ten years Â£15 000.000 would be required to
relieve a famine; that the population of
India has increased in the last ten year."
by 30.COO.000; that the huee sum of
200,000,000 rupees is now paid annually to
English officials, military and civilian;
that the appreciation of gold and the de
preciation of s-ilver, with the stoppage of
the coining of silver at the mints, have in
volved the population in common ruin,
and that English greed and misrule is the
cause of the famine.
The Queen, tiirough her private secre

John Burns, M. P., of the trade union
parliamentary committee, recently asked
the approval of that committee to the ap
pointment of a permanent trades union
bureau. The purpose of this new bureau
is to interfere in the settlement of trades
disputes, strikes Â«ni lockouts, to secure
from the various unions official help for
strikers, to initiate and to watch labor
legislat.ve work in Parliament and to
form tlie executive for all unions. The
men composing this permanent executive,
if it ever be constituted, will occuvy a
position of exceptional power in politics.
Mr. Burns' scheme is now being consid
ered by tiie respective trades unions. He
asserts ttiat a majority of the unions will
approve it and that its adoption by the
coming trades congress v sure. It may
be said that he is over-confident, but if the
congress does eventually agree to the bu
reau a new and potent force will operate
in British politics and in nil questions af
fecting the relations of capital and labor.

FRANCO-AMERICAN
TREATY JUBILEE
Banquet at Delmonico's in
Honor of the 119 th An-
niversary.
French and American F.'ags
Intertwined Are the Only
Decorations.
Felicitcus Messages Received by
Cable From Many Distinguished
Public Men.
NEW YORK. N. V., Feb. 6. -The one
hundred and nineteenth anniversary of
the signing of the treaty of alliance be
tween France and the American colonies
was celebrated to-night by the Empire
State Society of Sons of the American
Revolution with a banquet at Delmoni
co's. Fully 250 members and their guests
â were present. The decorations consisted
entirely of the French and American
colors entwined. Owing to the abs-nce of
j Hon. Chauncey M. Depew, president of
i the society, who was kept at home by a
i slight indisposition, Walter A. Logan pre
j sided.
After grace had been said and before
the guests had taken their seats Mr. Lo
gan announced that, on motion of Mr.
Depew, the following cablegram would be
sent to President Faure of the French re
public.
General Horace Porter seconded the
motion and Mr. Logan read:
Hi* Excellency Felix Faure, President, Paris,
France: The Society of the Sons of the Ameri
can Revolution, on the one hundred and nine
teenth anniversary of the treaty of the alli
ance with France, giateiully remembering the
priceless services 10 the founders of our NÂ«
tion, greets her illustrious President and gen
erous people, and expresses its sincere wish
for the perpetuation of the friendly relations
ot the two great republics.
Then thejdiners sat down to satisfy the
inner man, and between courses cahle
erams continued to arrive from promi
nent personages in France, among them
Emil LonLet of the French Senate, M.
Brisson, Dr. Rain. J. Patenotre, the
French Embassador, and a number of
others.
Samuel E Morss, United States Consul-
General to France, also sent the following
letter, which was read :
Paris, Jan. 22, 1897.
Colonel John C. Calhoun, Htpnsetitati of the
Empiic State Sncuty. Sin* of the American Jitvo
lulion â My Dear Sir: I very much auurecUto
anÂ«i wish to thank you for the invitation you
have extended me in bebalf of the Empire
State Society of tne Sons of the American
Revolution to attend the banquet to be given
in New York Feoruary t> next, it would give
me great pleasure to be present on that occa
siou, and I regret sincerely that it will be im
possible. The transcendent importance of the
event whicn it is proposed '.o commemorate in
such fitting manner becomes more important
as the yeers roll by, and its beneficent effects
upon Europe manifest thenuelves more
clearly. '1 h â  patriotism an>l the love of liberty
which sat at tho cnuncil-taDlf <when (he
memorable treaty of February 6,' 1777, was
signed will be^ recalled by more eloquent
tongues than mine. .
I can Bay that a residence of nearly four
years among the French people hns only In
t nsitied my respect and ndmirminn for them.
They il.ustrate in their character and in their
achievements many of the highest qualities
of tQi- world. The love of liberty, in bebalf of
which they have shed oceans of blood, is in
herent in them and I believe thnt the attach
ment of the great masses of them to free gov
ernment is as sincere and as fixed as that of
tc c American.
There are many, very many points of re
semb.anee and sympathy between ourselves
and the French nation, and I am sure that
with proper effort, the ties which DOW bind
the two great republics of the worid together
cou.d be strengthened and multiplied, to the
immense advantage oi both and with distinct
KHin to the causes of civilization, progress and
good government the worm nver. - â â  â¢â * .â¢
The French Parltameut hns already with
unanimity signified Its desire that a general
treaty of arbitration between France and the
United Stales should be made. Surely the
American people are ready to respond wilh
like unanimity to thi< cordial overture 01
peace and good will. L?t such a treaty be
made; let it be supplied by a convention
which shall as-ure to the I'nited States tho
benefit of the "favored nation." so far as the
admission of our pro Incts to French markets
is concerned; let tr>e United gtatt-s be repre
sented at the grent international exposition in
1900 in a manner worthy of her greatntss,
and tne warm relations between these two na
tions, which have never beer, interrupted for
a single moment since the execution 01 the
original treaty in 1777. will be so strength
ened and fortified as to Insure to eacli of them
a future rlcn in the blessings of moral ad
vane merit and material prosperity.
I have been very happy 10 co-operate with
you in bringing this enterprise of inter
na ional patriotism to the attention of the
leading representative of the French Govern
ment and ot tuo descendents of yet te,
R .Cham u and De Ora<*c, as w.ll as to the
leading exponents ol literature, sc-ience and
art. It has, indeed, been to me a labor ot love,
and I congratulate yÂ«>u and the society upon
the very graterul and handsome manner in
wh eh these distil guishea gentlemen and
ladiÂ»-s have responded. I am, sir, yours very
sii.cereiy. Samuel Â£. Mobsb.
At the guests' table with Mr. Logan
â were Coiuul-General Eruwaert, Consul

Mr. Logan, who acted as toastmaster in
Mr. D-pew's absence, said: "It is your
mibfoitune and mine, gentlemen, that Mr.
Depew is detained by illness lrom being
with us -to-night, a? we ail had until the
last moment expected him. I am glad to
say, however, Unit his illness, while seri
ous enough to prevent his being here, is
not serious enough to give alarm to his

Dr. John S.. White, in responding to the
toast, 'Our Dfbi to France," said that by
ceding to us for the nominal sum of $15 -
OOO.OOU about 700,0X).0C0 acres of land our

SCENE AT A MURDER TRIAL.
Sensational Testimony of a Female Stenog
rapher Whose Character Is
Bt fleeted Upon.
CHICAGO, 111.. Feb. 6.â During the
trial to-day of Alderman O'Alalley and
John Sentry, charged with the murder of
Gus Coliander, Miss Shirley, the stenogra
pher in the State Attorney's oflice, who is
alleged io have furnished Attorney For
rest, counsel for O'Malley, with notes
taken at a private examination of btate
witnesses by Assistant State Attorney
Pierson, testified that her notes were cor
rect.
While croÂ»s-examininjj Miss Shirley
State Attorney Dineen put his questions
in such a manner that they might have
been construed into an attack upon the
reputation of the witness. Attorney For
rest objected, and after the jury had bet- n
excluded State Attorney Dineen artackei
the character of Miss Snirley, making ac
cusations of a startling and cruel char
acter.
Tho attorneys for the defense protested
and Judjre 'luley refused to allow'evidence
against the moral character of Miss Shir
ley to be admitted.
Miss Shirley accused the State Attorney
and Mr. Pierson, his assistant, of having
ordered her to doctor tbe transcript of the
shorthand notes she had taken of Wimese
Smith's interview with the State Attorney.
She swore that Mr. Pierson ordered her
to omit all "side" questions ami ihe de
fense alleges that this proves Smith was
tutored in his testimony.
Attorney Forrest jumped to his feet and
shouted: "1 demand the disbarment of
Mr. Dineen."
Tlie State Attorney openly talks of
bribery being resorted to by the defense to
get Miss Shirley's testimony.
The State intends to bring in testimony
impeaching the woman's version of the
Smith interview, but it is understood that
Mr. Dineen's refusal to admit the inter
view as true will work in favor of O'Mal
ley's acquittal.
THE BIG RAILROAD TRUST.
A Report That the Big Four Is Leading a
Stampede to Smash It and
the Rates.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 6.â lt is reported
here that the joint traffic trust of Eastern
railroads leading from Chicago and St.
Louis to the AtJantic seaboard is practi
cally dissolved. The trust controlled ab
solutely the traffic between the Mississippi
River and the East. Unable to live on
the percentage allotted to it, the Bis Four
began about ten days ago to pay rebate to
shippers.
This action was followed by the Penn
sylvania, Michigan Central, Â£oston and
Albany, Clover Leaf, Lake Erie and West
ern, West Shore and Fitchburg railroads,
and precipitated a demoralization in rates
which has not been equaled in ten years.
It is said that by the end of the week the
trust will have ceased to exist.
BI'FFALO, N. V., Feb. 4.â A represen
tative of the United Associated Pres-es in
terviewed a number of railroad officials
to-day concerning the report of a threat
ened breakup of the Joint Traffic Associa
tion. Amonu those seen were several who
were in attendance on tbe joint passenger
committee meeting here, none of whom
placed any credence in the report.
The bureau of inspection of the associa
tion in Buffalo was working lull swing
yesterday as though no report of its pros
pective collapse was in circulation.
J. H. Burger, the Buffalo agent of the
association, was out of town and his assist
ants had nothing to sny about the matter.
Chief Clerk Smitn said: '-If there was
any trouble with the Big Four, the Wa
bash, the Pennsylvania or the Grand
Trunlc a meeting of tne board of control
would have been called long before this,
ami no such meeting has ben called."
J. ii. Wood, general passenger agent
of the Pennsylvania, said thai he had not
even beaid any gossip or reports of the
nature outlined in the Chicago dispatches.
Edwin J. Weeks, formerly of tbe New
York Central, and now of the Philadel
phia and Reading, has not heard of any
trouoie, and said the report was untrue.
L. N. Jarvis of the Traders' D.spatch
gave the report a similar reception. He
said he especially doubted the Big Four
had broken away, as lugalli wrs practi
cally the lather of the association and was
deeply interested in the Big Four.
BLOODSHED IN OKLAHOMA.
Terrible Outcome cf a Land Quarrel at
Stroude â People of the Town
Pan/c-S ricken.
GUTHKIE, O. T., Feb. 6 âWhen com
munication was restored with StrouUe
to-day, tbe true details of yesterday's
trouble were obtained. Two weeks ago,
while quarreling over land, Jim Gritiii
was shot and nearly killed and vis father
sligntly wounded by Henry Lustin.
Lustin was arrested, but admitted to bail
Wednesday. Griffis an<! his three sons,
accompanied oy four oibeymen, rode into
S;roude, and compelled everybody to
close their stores and hide away, saying
there was going to be a battle. Several
hours later, as Henry Lustin, his son
Everett, Jim Fuber aud Kobinson were
entering the town they were ambuscaded
and compelled to surrender to the other
crowd, who bound them to horses and
rode off into the Creek country with
them. Later they relea-ed Jim Furber,
who returned and ?aid that they bad de
clared they would hang Lustin and shoot
his non and Robinson.
The people of Stroude were completely
terrorized, and most of them have been
afraid to venture from their hou es since.
A posse was organized at Chandler yes
terday to go to the rescue of the three
men carried off, but there is little hope
of reaching them in the woods and moun
tains of the Creek country.
A message from Stroude Jate this even
ing -avs a report had reached there that
Henry Lustin and Robinson have been
luund dead, banging to trees and their
bodies riddled with bullets, but it cannot
be confirmed.
Stroude is south of the Sac and Fox
agency and this encounter gave rise to
the reports yesterday of the raid upon the
agency, which did not take place.
DAMAGE TO THE ItHOOKLTy.
Ilithin. a Short Time the Cruiter Will

CHESTER, Pa., Feb. 6 âIf the con
ditions remain lavorable. it looks to-day
as thou h the cruiser Brooklyn may leave
her anchorage at Marcus Hook for the dry
dock of the League Island navy-yard to
morrow afternoon. The stevedores finished
unloading the coal from the vessel this
morning, vi.d all the ammunition basb een
taken out. Tbe diver's report shows that
the plates have been ripped from a point
near the bow to a point under the engine
room, but the damage is confined to the
port side. The injury is serious, but it is
not as bad as was at first thought from the
quantity of water forced into the double
bottom" compartments. Tlie skin is not
damaged and the bolts are not sheared off.
Captain Cook has received a telecram trom
Eleven Point lighthouse. Michigan, ex
pressing sympathy for the accident to the
Brooklyn. The captain for a number of
years was stationed at this lighthouse.

DO NOT FAVOR
MURRAY'S PLAN
Congressmen Not Ready to
Contest ths Vote of
South Carolina.
So the Colored Representative
May Not Present the
Petition.
Many Complications and Postpone*
ment of BttcK njey's Inauguration
Might Follow a Ccntest.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 6.â The
publication of the fact that Hon. G. W.
Murray, the colored representative from
Iho First District of South Carolina, in
tended to protest against the counting of
the electoral vote of that State engaged
the interested attention of Murray's col
leagues, a!l Denvoorais, to-day, and sev
eral informal conferences were held at
which Senator Tillman was present. After
one of these Mr. Tillman said:
"I: Mr. McKinley is goiiiÂ£ to be inau
gurated on the 4th of March, the joint
convention has got to count the vote of
South Carolina. If the Republican party
wants to iuake an attack on the constitu
tion of the State, it must make it on some
other ground or in some other manner
than by endeavoring to prevent the count
ing of her vote.
"I wish to go further and express my
preference for seeing Mr. McKinley Presi
dent than to see the Presidential function
exerci-^id by Mr. Olney, as it will be after
the 4th of March if the effort is made to
deny South Carolina the right to vote.
This has been my feeling for a long time
past"
Murray was said to base his proposed
protest upon a memorial numerously
signed by colored residents of South Caro
lina, reciting that the constitution of the
State violated the fourteenth ami fifteenth
amendments to the constitution of the
United States and the law of 1837 provid
ing for the admission of South Carolina
into the Union; and that it was invalid
because it had not been submitted to the
voters of the State for their approval.
Representative J. L. McLaunn of South
Carolina, who has held the office of Attor
ney-General of the State, traversed these
objections this afternoon to a reporter of
the United Associated Presses. He said:
"Tne constitution of South Carolina is a
valid constitution, although not submitted
to the people of South Carolina for ratifi
cation. It has never been the custom in
the State to suhmit its new constitutions
to the people ior ratification.
"The only instance in which this rule
was varied irom was in ISGB. In many of
the other States their constitutions have
not yet been so submitted. The a;t of
the Legislature of South Carolina calling
the constitutional convention of 18'J5 did
not require the ratification of its work t>y
the people. Besides, this constitution
was at once and ever biiicÂ» has been recog
nized by all the departments of the State
Government as the organic law of the
State."
McLanrin said the members from his
State desired to have it distinctly under
stood thet if Congress was led into mat
ing any contest over the vote of that State,
the probabilities were that Mr. McKiniey*
will not be inaugurated President of the
United States on the 4th oi March.
"If Congress is going inio the merits of
the vote oi South Carolina," he continued,
"steps will be taken to see that the votes
of Northern States, concerning the valid
ity of which mucu doubt has been ex
pressed, notably the vote of Ohio, will be
investigated before those electoral votes
are counted. We have fair elections in
South Carolina."
The probabilities seem to be, upon in
quiry this afternoon, that the advertised
protest will not be made. Murray ex
pressed great doubt of his ability to get it
into suaps in time to be effective. So far
as could be learned tliis afternoon Mur
rey has no support from Republican Con
gressmen of the South.
McCall of Tennessee said that he never
heard of tne proposition to contest the
vote of South Carolina until he saw the
publication to-day. He <iid not believe
that any of his colleagues from that sec
tion of the country would advise such a
step, and he mm self disclaimed any in
tention of doing so.

ARMOR-PLATE INQUIRY.
D ffsrences os to the Cost Fer Ton May
Lead to the Establishment of a
Government Plant.
WASHINGTON', D. C, Feb. 6. âThe
disposition of the troublesome question of
armor-plate, its cost, etc., appears to be
one upon which the Committee on Naval
affairs cannot speedily reach a conclusion.
An hour and a half was consumed this
morning in considering the Chandler re
port, but no conclusion was reached.
That portion relative to the cost oi armor
was not touched upon. The Secretary of
the Navy iixeJ the cost at $400 and Chan
dler reduces it to $300. The firms en
gaged in the manufacture of the armor
are now receiving $500 and $350 a ton. The
committee will further consider the sub
ject next Tuesday.
It is evident that the language of the
Chandler report is too severe in some re
spects to suit the comnii. tee. During the
day's session it was toned down in some
portions. The strictures upon the alleged
conduct of Commodore Folger h:<ve noi
yet been reached, but a determined effort
3 to be made by the friends of this official
to eliminate Chandler's severe condemna
tion in this respect.
The main question before the committee
is what sum shall be fixed as the prnper
amount to be paid for armor plate. This
is a difficult problem and its solution has
not been worked out. The consensus of
opinion appears to be, however, of naming
the amount in the bill instead of leaving
it discretionary with the (secretary of the
Navy, as has been suggested by some
membersof the comraitiee. It is believed
that in the end the committee will tulop;
the figures of Secretary Herbert, viz., $400
a ton. Extremists on ttu committee : o
even, lower than Mr. Chandler, Mr. Till
man having stated that $100 a ton was suf
ticient for tiiis work.
It is not the intention of the committee
to leave ti.e Secretary at the mercy of the
two armor-plate concerns of the United
Slates and thus jeopardize tt.e three arm
ored vessels now on the way*. It the price
is fixed at $400 * ton there will be a ttavine
of about $1)0 a ton, or $500,000 on each
worship. Tne committee is favorable to a
provision in the bill fixing the price to be
paid for this armor wi.ich will carry an
appropriation sufficient to enable theSec
reiary in his discretion to purcha-e or
build an armor-plate plant on behalf of
the Government.
This can be done, the committee be
lieves, for $2,000,000 or $2,500,000. This
will be done, ii at all, not so much because
the Government wants \o build such a
plant, but for the reason that it will act as
awholestme regulator and prevent the
armor-plate firms from refu-ing to supply
armor at the price fixed by Congress.
Whether it would be wise for the Gov
ernment to enter upon this work is a ques
tion upon wiiich there is a difference of
opinion. When he was before the com
mittee Secretary Herbert sta'ed that it
would probably cost mure for the Govern
ment to construct a plant than it would
cost private capital, and he admitted that
it would also probably co^t more to make
the armor. Th provisional appropriation
for such a plant is deemed essential to com
pel the contractors to lower their bids, and
there is no doubt but that it will be in
serted in the proposed bilL

case in wnich there was any question was
that of Captain Thomas Henry Barry of
the First Infantry, nominated to be assist

SUGAR AND COFFEE
TRUSTS UNDER FIRE
Havemeyer and Arbuckle
Heard by the Lexow
Committee.
Secretary Searles Fails to Ap-
pear, and May Ba Prose
cuted for Contempt.
One Witness Tells Hew Thousands
Lost Employment, and Havemeyer
Said He Was a Liar.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 6.â The joint
committee appointed by the Legislature
to investigate trusts and monopolies in
the Siate resumed its session this morn
ing. Senator Lexow and Parsons & Shep
ard, counsel for Secretary Searlea of the
American Sugar Refinery Company, held
a consultation lasting about ten minutes.
At its conclusion, it was learned that the
lawyers had promised that Mr. Searles
would be on hand Monday.
It was 11:30 o'clock when Mr. Lexow
rapped for order. He directed the ser
geam-at-arms to call the name of John E.
dearies. There was no response. Lawyer
Pardons said Mr. Searles was compelled to
take a train for Washington when he was
served with the subpena. lie stated that
Mr. Searles would appear before the com
mittee on Monday next and bring the re
uuired data.
"We will consider your explanation,
Mr. Parsons, in executive session ana will
determine whether we will hold Mr.
Searles in contempt or allow him to purge
himself by appearing on Monday before
the committee." said Mr. Lexow.
John Arbuckle was then recalled to the
stand. He informed the committee that
he wiahed to make a statement. He told
the committee that the profit in coffee in
lS9ti was only % of a cent per pound; in
18y5 a little les* than G-10 of a cent; in
1894 6-10 of a cent and in 1893 a little less
than G-10 of a cent.
"There is no profit in the coffee business
for us now and I should say the Have
raeyers must be losing from $500 to
$1000 a day in the business," said Mr.
Arbuckle. The witness also said that he
believed that if his company stopped buy
ing sugar refineries the Uavemeyers would
get out of the coffee business to-morrow.
James N. Jarvie, the partner of Ar
buckle, was also recalled. He testi
lied that there was no profit in the coffee
business for the past two years. There
v.as indirect contradiction of the state
ment of H. O. Havemeyer, who testified
that the coffee business presented a most
ahunng held for speculation and gave
magnificent returns for any investment.
Mr. Jarvie said there were about 10,000
coffee- roasting firms in the United States.
The three leading firms are tbe Arbuckle's
Company, the McLaughlin Company of
Chicago and the Woolson Spice Company.
Senator Lexow then went into an ex
haustive inquiry about the coffee trade,
and the witness explained all about tbe
prices. Mr. Lexow announced a recess
until 2 o'clock, and said that in the mean
lime tbe committee would hold an execu
tive session.
The executive session lasted about ten
minutes. At its conclusion Chairman
Lexow announced tt,at me committee had
deferred action in the Searles matter until
10 o'clock Monday next, when it was ex
pected he would ba present.
H. O. Havemeyer was ou hand when the
committee reassembled. He was recalled,
and in reply to a question denied that
there were any sugar refineries closed after
the consolidation of 1891. Mr. Havemeyer
gave a lot of figures snowing that the price
of sugar was reduced 10 cents per 100
pounds since the formation of the trust.
John Bergen testified that he was em
ployed as foreman of the American fcugar
Rennery Company up to 1892, and was
discharged with 600 or 700 omers. The
witness said that at the time of organiza
tion of the trust in 1887 6000 or 7000 men
were discharged.
Mr. Havemeyer, who was sitting near
the reporters' table, smiled at tnis state
ment and said: "That man is a bigger liar
than he looks."
Tiie witness said that the men were not
re-employed ana bad to scatter all over
the country in search of employment. lie
further said that he understood one of the
refiueries that closed was being turned
into a coffee mill. Eight refineries were
closed since the formation of the trust,
and there was only one running now.
John Arbuckle again took the stand.
He wanted to explain that the price o!
coffee was very variable and that he be
lieved it to be the most speculative busi
ness in the world. He said his firm con
trolled about one-fourth o? the coffee trade
of the United States and was handling
about 1,000,000 bags annually. He s;iid
there was no agreement between his farm
and other big firms to tix prices.
The witness, however, admitted that the
price lixed by his firm was pretty gener
ally followed by other firms.
"Occasionally the price falls tinder
ours," explained Mr. Arbuckle.
At this Juncture Chairman Lexow an
nounced adjournment until Monday.

THIS STRIKES AT OLYMPIA.
Scheme to Remove Washington's Capitol
to the Scores of Puget
Sound.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 6 âAn effort is
being made to put the State capiiol on
â wheels and remove it from Olympia. A
Spokane syndicate is said to have
secured an option on a large tract
of .land between Taconaa and Seat
tle, on the shore of Puget Sonnd, and
to have a bill ready to introduce in the
Legislature, authorizing the removal of
the capita!, and the State's acceptance of
the be^t offer submitted for a site and re
imbursement for the $90,000 already ex
pended on foundations for toe newcapitol.
Should this scheme go through â and
'.here are many throughout the State who
claim that a more central location would
be beneficialâ a new town wuld spring
up about the new capitol. Projectors of
the enterprise would "reap a profit out of
land sales.
It is possible that this syndicate will
adopt the Texas plan and offer to build a
$1,000,000 Capitol in return for the 200.000
--acre land grant given to the State by C n
gress for Caphol pun oses.
Bills have been introduced this week to
remove th â  Supreme Court and State
Library from Olympia to Tacoma, the
object beins to lessen expenses of litiga
tion by obviating the necessity of lawyers'
daily triua to Olympia. The Supreme
Court favors the plan, and a majority of
both Houses is said to indorse it.

the Quincy-street druggist.
Several days previous the young man
began to loiter in the drugstore. He said
ne was Harry KohLr of San Francisco
and claimed to know relatives of Mr.
Gehrung. Kohler said that he was finan
cially embarrassed ana hinted to Mr.
Gehrung about borrowing money from

any day from his relatives. Mr. Gehrung
was suspicious and notified the police.
in the police court to-da3 r the prisoner
said his real name was Wendell Phillips
and that his parents lived at Flint, Mich.
He toid an apparently straightforward
siory concerning himself, to the effect
that he was an expert electrician, and had
lived in San Francisco four years. He

days, which was suspended for three days
in order to eive Phillips a chance to leave
the city. Judge Fiedler warned Phillips
to give up the woman, and the prisoner
replied that he had come to bis senses

President, taking advantage of a preroga
tive rarely exercised, placed Colonel Rob
ert E. Crofton, commanding the Fifteenth
Infantry, with headquarters at Foit Bay
ard, N. Mex., on the retired list of the
army, under the statute enabling the Ex
ecutive, aa comniander-in-chief, to retire
an officer who reaches tte age cf 62 years,
Crofton having reached the required age
last December.
The Fifteenth Infaatry, stationed at
Fort Sheridan, 111., was considered poorly
disciplined, and an effort was made to re
tire Colonel Crofton for physical disabil
ity, but the examining board did not find
him incapacitated to command, and
shortly afterward the regiment was or
dered away from Cbicago Influences,
which wero thought to be deleterious to
the discipline, and sent to the Mexican
border. Colonel Crofton ranked No. 4
among army colonels, and would have
been promoted to be a general but for his
compulsory retirement in 1898.
The last occasion upon which the 62
--year law was utilized was in the case of
General Carr. who was retired by Presi
dent Harri:>on to create a vacancy in the
grade of funeral, but was no reflection
upon the orti:er in the latter case.
NEW BUSH LEASED.
G. K. Crater Promises to Run a First-

MADE WELL
A New and Remarkable Discovery
for Conquering Disease*
Marvelous Results Achieved in Curing Chronic
Ailments by Electro-Medical
Treatment* ..
j - --.>; â  . ... ;
THE USE OF ELECTRICITY IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
has been developed to such a degree that it now forms a very
large and important element in the treatment of all chronic, lingering
and special diseases. While it is not claimed to be a universal specific,
it is recognized .as a curative agent of inestimable value, capable of
being employed with excellent success in the treatment of a variety of
chronic diseases, and experiments have demonstrated that it is without ,
doubt the most important ally yet discovered to the resources of
medicine. '<â¢â 
To be benefited by electricity it should be used only under the
direction of a skilled physician â one who has mastered the physics,
physiology, mechanics and chemistry of medical electricity; one who
fully understands the kind and strength of current that each case
requires.
. The use of an electric current for forcing medicines through the
body to diseased organs is not a new idea. It has been practiced by the
medical world for a number of years, but has been used in but a very,
limited number of cases. This idea has been made a special study by
the State Electro-Medical Institute doctors, and as a result of an elaborate
series of experiments they have evolved a system of treatment that
combines all the curative virtues of medicine and medical electricity â a
treatment that is in every respect and particular the most perfect and
nearest infallible of any ever discovered in the world.
The Electricity is applied either by a Galvanic, Faradic or Static
battery, or by means of Electric Belts, Body Batteries or other Electric
Appliances, the variety of current and kind of appliance used in each
case being of that nature which the Institute doctors deem best adapted
for the speedy cure of the disease with which the patient is afflicted.
The electric current penetrates the body and stimulates the action of
the various organs, and at the same time acts as a tonic on the nerves
and the system generally. In connection with the electric treatment
medicines are administered. These medicines are perfect , laboratory
triumphs, formnlated from a true appreciation of the medicinal wants of
the body. Through a proper arrangement of the different poles of the
batteries on the body the electric current is made to carry the medicines
directly to diseased parts, thus hastening the curing action of the medi-
cines, and in a brief period the disease is conquered and the patient is
restored to heal th and strength.
HEALTH, STRENGTH AND BEAUTY;
-â¢ . This form of treatment is new and original with the Institute. It
is the elaboration and perfection to such a degree of an old idea in
medical therapeutics that it can truly be called a new scientific discovery.
It is a form of treatment that especially commends itself to those who
are sick and suffering from chronic diseases and have failed to obtain
relief from other sources, remedies or doctors. For this reason the
Institute urges those who have used electricity as applied . according to
old methods and ideas, or those who have used medicines alone, as well
as those who have used both combined and have not received relief, to
come and investigate the claims and methods of treatment at the
Institute.
It is fast becoming the Mecca of the sick and suffering, for the
merit of this new treatment as demonstrated by many cures of cases that
were regarded as hopeless has earned for it an enduring fame and daily
scores of people throng the Institute consultation-rooms anxious to
receive the relief from their ills that has come to others who have taken
advantage of this marvelous method of mastering disease.

by a' Colonization
Company.
Induced to Invest in Sandy

Government Officials Are Investigat-
ing and Will Prosecute the
Promoters.
I.OS ANGELES. Cal., Feb. 6.â A colo
nization scheme of large proportions is
about to be nipped in tiie bud by Govern
ment officials. The swindle has been
called to the attention of the State and
Federal authorities and is now engaging
their attention. The Federal and State
Grand Juries have, it is stated, conducted
â¢ an investigation and the persons involved
in the scheme will have to explain certain
things whion at the present time seem In
explicable.
The scheme involves the selling of Gov
ernment land to colonists by an Illinois
c >ncern on the Mojave Desert, the title to
v tiioh is held by others from the Govern
ment. From $200,000 to $400,000 has been
eoueed out of the unsuspecting, some of
the land being sold at $30 an acre.
The matter was laid before the Interior
Department at Washington, and it is
stated that a report of the Interior De
partment excoriates the schemer? in the
most vigorous manner.
The Federal authorities will move first
by instituting proceedings for the misuse
of the Government mails. The dupes of
the concern are indignant and several
hundred of them arÂ« clamoring for imme
diate justice.
Among its projectors are some well
known California people. The patron- of
the wily swindlers are in the Eastern
States, the business having been obtained
through adroitly worded advertisements
in the newspapers, with the usual assur
ances of new railways, gold mines and
townsites innumerable.
DENIED A CHANGE OF VENUE.
Southern Pacific Fails in an Attempt to
Transfer Suits to San Fran-
csco.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 6.â A vsry
important decision was rendered by Su
perior Judge York here to-day upon en
ticeiv new issues of far-reaching signifi
cance. Four suits of the same nature
ane involved, the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company being the defendant in
each.
The plaintiffs are Emtle Deutch, Henry
E.ms and R. W. Poindexter. all citizens
of this county, and the Farming and
Fruit Land Company, a corporation.
Xhe 01 iniou forms tbe denial of a mo
tion made by the attorneys for the de
iÂ»ndant company for a cuange of venue
iron the Superior Court of this county to
tue Superior Court of the City and County
of San Francisco.
â¢ Irv the language of the court, "the
ground of the motion is solely that the
defendant has its principal place of busi
ness in San Francisco ami is a resident of
BÂ»;d city and county."
The actions are for damages for breach
of contracts. In each complaint an issue
is rendered as to the title of defendant in
certain lands which it contracted to con
vey to p aintiffV assignors.
"The right of action of plaintifTV,' says
the coart, "is not wholly dependent upon
â the title which the plaintiffs nave in said
lands, but principally, the right of action
depends upon the fact of a finai determin
ation by the Supreme Court of the United
States that a patent affirming the title to
defendant in said lands cannot issue."
Judge York funher says: "Although
the title to the lands which the defendant
has contracted to convey may become one
of the collateral questions to be deter
mined on the trials of said causes,
nevertheless as the title to said lands
will in no way be affected by this action
and tbe action is not proiecuted for the
determination of any interest in real es
tate, I hold that tbe title to land is in no
way involved in these actions. The de
lendant has shown that its principal place
of business is in the City and County of
San Francisco, but it has not shown
where the contract was made or where it
was to be performed or where the breach
ot contract occurred."
In audition to the proof upon the point
of "principal place of business," the other
requirements "enumerated in section 16
of articie XII of the constitution must be
complied with," saves the court. The de
cision concludes as follows:
"It not being sufficient to Drove simply
that the principal place of busineso of the
defendant corporation is in the City and
Coun ly of San Francisco :n order to obtain
chance of venue to the Superior Court of
that City and County, it follows that the

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 6.â A Call
correspondent is reliably informed that a
spur railroad will bo constructed from
Benedict Station, on the line from Ana
heim to the new pucar factory at Alamitos
in Orange County, to the land upon which
K. J. Northam has secured an option near
the Bolsa Cnico Bay.
Colonel Northam has taken an option
on over 4COO acres of land adjoining the
Bolsa Chico, and nas already arraneed to
build a tine residence out on the high
mesa near the bay. The Bolsa Chico is
I one of the most sightly locations in the
I western portion of the Santa Ana Valley
] for a town, and it is not improbable that a
! settlement of considerable size will soon
I build up as a result of the construction of
trte new road.
The land that Northam has obtained is
i now sown to barley, but next year it is
the intention of the new owner to plant a
large portion of it to sugar beets. It is
I situated about ten miles Irom the Alami
j tos factory and on the line of the railroad.

LOS ANGELES. Cal., Feb. 6.â A pay
ing business for this city is promised at
Phoenix, Ariz., in the purchase of crude
! oil as fuel for power purposes.
C. M. Hast, who is operating the Con
tention mine for San Francisco owners,
has erected a five-stamp mill at the Ari
j zona canal, eight miles from Phoenix.
The fupl used is crude oil, and by a sys
tem of constant explosions the machinery
| is propelled at limited cost, and it is said
! quite successfully.
The amount required is surprisingly
! small, as thirty-two gallons suffice for
I twenty-four hours, being but one and a
third ' gallons an hour. The oil costs
| about 20 cents a gallon, making the cost
of fuel but $6 40 a day â less than the value
of two cords of wood. For two weeks the
mill has been running without a hitch,
and it is believed the experiment will
prove a decided success.

CARRIER PIGEONS FOR ALASKA.
Proposed Establishment of a Homing
Service Between Sitka and
June a v.
PORT TOWNSEND, Win., Feb. 81â
For a loms: time past tbe wide-awake
artisans of Alaska bave been chafing
under the inconveniences resultant
upon inadequate communication between
distant places, particularly Sitka, tbe
capital, and Juneau, the metropolis.
The recent escape aud seusational re
capture of Desperado Birch has again
brought tbe matter up, it being argued
that the long delay would have been
avoided had the authorities of two towns
been able to communicate with each other
by any other means than steam launches
ot no remarkable speed.
The ereat amount of money required to
lay a cable from Juneau to SitKa forces
that proposition out of consideration, but
the Alaska Searchlight has come to tbe
front with a substitute that would be
almost as gooa as the telegraph and
would work material improvement on ex
isting conditions.
The plan suggested by the Searchlight
is simply the establishment of dove-cotes
in the two towns and the stocking of them
with carrier-pigeons, to be used when the
occasion requires.
It is proposed to let the business men of
the two towns pay tue expenses. The
Searchlight cites "the efficient marine
homing pipeon service between San Fran
cisco and the Faraliones as a practical
demonstration of the wisdom of its sug
gestion.

CARSON, New, Feb. 6.â Edward Cook
reached Carson this morning in search of
a site for Corbett's training quarters. He
had a long talk with the owner of Shaws
Hot Springs, but reached no agreement,
and will start in the morninjr for Walleys
Springs, between Carson and Genoa. He
learned that Fitz*immons was expecting
to train at Shaws, and did not believe it
just the thing to have the two men in the
same place; they might not get along at
the table.
D. A. Bender of the Virginia and Truckee
Railroad arrived from San Francisco this
niorni!i<*. He had been below to arrange
with the Southern Pacific regarding rates.
As new men were put on at the Virginia
and Truckee shops after he returned it is
regarded as quite certain that he has
learned that Carson will get the mill.
Work io being pushed in every depart
ment ot the railroad in arranging for the
extra travel.
Cook said it was not material to him
where the fight took place. His principal
was ready to be anywhere on the 17th of
next month. Cook is now leaning strongly
toward Carson. He thinks it is to be the
place, but is waiting for Stuart to arrive
and give the word. It wss reported this
evening that Wheelock had received word
from Smart that he had selected Carson,
but he declines to answer any questions
regarding the matter, merely saying that
his partner will be along in a day or so.

people.
The vote was very close in all parts of
the district and the successful faction
elected only three of the live directors.
The new board of directors includes L.
H. Martin, Milton McWhorter, J. N. i
King, Joseph Meadows and C. S. Camp-
I 1**!!. Of these McWhorter, Martin and
Meadows are favorable to continuing the
scheme as itlready promoted.
The point of contention in the election
was the act of the old board awarding the
contract for constructing the cnnal system
to P. Y. Baker for $1,500,000. He is to
take bonds of the district for this amount
as his pay.
The opposition claim that the contract
was not given to Baker honestly, and that
the work for which he is to receive $1,500,- I
000 can be done for about $500,000.
The feeling in the district is bitter, as j
many of the residents and property-own
ers believe they are being imposed upon. ;

Canadian* (font a Tariff.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 6.â The
Dairymen's Association and the Fruit
growers' Association of British Columbia
have now joined every agricultural asso
ciation in the province in formally re
questing that there be no reduction in the
tariff on farm products imported from the
States. Indeed, in the critical condition
of general farming in many parts of this
province, handicapped as it is by low
prices, difficulty in marketing and heavy
farm rnortga es, prominent farmers here
hold that if the duties on loreign imports
be abolished, British Columbia agricultur
ists in the coast districts may just as well
give up the struggle and leave. They can
not, it is said, compete against the prices

FOUND DYING
ON HIS BEAT
Night Watchman Alford of
Watsonville Killed by
a Bullet.
Believed to Have Attempted an
Arrest and Encountered
Resistance.
Rough Character Under Suspicion Sud
denly Disappears From tbe
Town.
WATSONVILLE, Cal., Feb. aâ Night
Watchman John W. Alford was found dy
ing on the sidewalk on Lower Main street
at 2:30 o'clock this morning. Near
his hand lay a pistol and a bullet had
penetrated his brain. He expired at 7
o'clock without regaining consciousness.
Indications point to a cold-blooded mur
der.
"Jack" Bode and Carrie Smith, who
have figured in the justice courts here at
different times in the past, are believed
to know more of the officer's death than
they have revealed. Aoout 8:30 o'clock
this morning Carrie Smith awakened
Belle Anderson, a resident of the tender
loin district, and told her that Alvord had
shot himself.
Miss Anderson dressed herself and ac
companied the Smith woman to where she
found Aiford lying on the sidewalk, bleed
ing xrom a bullet wound in his head. She
at once blew her police-whistle, Officer
Fiske arrived and the dying watchman
was taken to Dr. Watter's sanitarium,
where he lingered for several hours.
There are several theories in regard to
the shooting, borne of the local officers
contend that it was a case of suicide, but
can give no reasqn for such a course. It
seems that "Jack" Bodie was given six
mouths in the County Jajl or the privi
lege of leaving the county some time ago
wnen arraigned on a charge of vagrancy.
He returned to Watsonville on Thursday
evening.
Officer Aiford had threatened to arrest
him if he ever returned, and as he had
been seen last evening it is believed that
Altord attempted to do hist duty aud was
killed for his trouble. Bodie has not
been seen since.
Miss Smith was detained for an inter
view by the Sheriff, but has since been
dismissed on her own recognizance. The
inquest has been postponed until Mon
day, so as to give the officers more time
to work on the case.
Aiford was a member of the United
Workmen and leaves a widow and eigut
children.

ises to-day lor evidence against Greeorio
I. Ybarra, charged with the murder of
the rancher, Detective Clarence >V. Bro
baclc of the local force discovered an im

against the prisoner.
Shortly after the stabbing of Henderson,
when the Sheriff placed Ybarra under ar
rest, the latter denied ail knowledge of
the killing, and when the officers found
an ordinary caseknife among the prison
er's effects he claimed it was the only
knife he possessed. The wounds on Hen
derson's body were not inflicted wkh a
weapon of this character, and Detective
Broback was detailed to search for such a
Knife as he had seen in Ybarra's posses
sion shortly before the affray in which
Henderson met his death. He to-day
brought to light a dangerous - looking
butctier-knife, about nine inches long,
with a blade of about five inches and an
extremely sharp point and keen edge,
which he found in the prisoner's cabin on
Henderson's rancn.

was arrested yesterday afternoon and
locked in the city calaboose, charged with
drunkenness. He was put into, the ceil

in the day and who gave his name as
Shephard. Three hours afterward the

Stream Which Had Engulfed Its
Owner.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 6â Anne
looking bright bay horse, saddled and
bridled, but lacking a rider, swam from
the Laguna de Santa Rosa yesterday,
landing near the lllingsworth bridge, two
miles north of Sebastopo).
The bridge was at the time several feet
under water and the Laguna was bank
deep with the Hood. That some unfortu
nate rider had attempted to cross the
stream in vain is certain, and a search is
now being made for the body. The ani
mal was greatly exhausted when found
and bore unmistakable signs of having
recently been ridden.
For a time it was feared that the miss
ing man Wi>uld prove to be a Mr. Lindsay
of Guernevllle, who was seen driving cat
tle in that vicinity yesterday, but a tele
phone dispatch from Guerneville reports
that gentiemon safe at home. No one is

GAVE HER POISON,

Thomas Siddall Answers

Wife.
Acted Under a Doctor's Order
When He Induced Her lo

Tue Millbrae Man R -leased Frcm
Prison on Habeas Corpus
Proceedings.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Feb. 6 â
Thomas A. Siddall, who was arrested at
Millbrae yesterday afternoon, charged by
Dr. A. E. Baldwin of San Mateo with be
ing insane and dangerous to be at larg-,
and who is accused of having yesterday
poisoned his wife by administering mor.
phine to her, spent last night in the
County Jail at this place.
To-day he is a free man, having this
afternoon been brought before the Supe
rior Court on habeas corpus proceedings.
The Judge allowed him to go on his own
recognizance, provided he would appear
again Monday morning for further exam
ination.
His release was obtained on a techni
cality, he not having been proDerly com
mitted. The complaint on which he was
anested was signed by Dr. Baldwin, but
was not sworn to as required by law.
Siddall is a man about 28 years of age,
and his wife is 25 years old. He stated
to-day that his wife has been subject to j
fits, and when in this condition she bau |
been in the habit of taking morphine
pills, under the direction ol a physiciau.
She had been ailing for two or three days
previous to the alleged poisoning and, she
being worse yesterday, he gave her a
morphine pili.
This not having the desired effect, he i
her another a half hour later. He ;
'lenies that he did so with any evil motive.
He was merely carrying out the directions
of a physician.
As a result, svmptonis of poisoning be
gan to' appear. Hie became worse and
physicians â were summoned. For awhile
her life was despaired of, but the efforts
of the physicians proved successful. It
was learned to-day that she was able to be
up and around.
Ttie couple liave one young chid, which
the mother had been nursing and which
also showed symptoms of poisoning. The
chi.ii is quite ill.
Siddall aimitted that his married life
had been anything but happy and har
monious. He has been married about
three y?ars and i: is undervood that he
comes of a wealttiy family in England.
While living in Ontario, Canada, his wife
had him arres ed on a charge of insanity,
but that charge was dismissed.
At that time he transferred all of his
property to hsr, he being then a prosper
ous grocer. On cornine to this county he
purchased a home i;i Milibrae. which he
has since given to his wife. He now .'-ays
that she is trying to get rid of him, and
that certain persons living in his neigh
borhood have conspired with her for that
purpose. He accuses his wife of having
an ungovernable temper, citing several
instances when she had threatened to do
him bodily harm. One time lie was com
pelled to destroy a pistol that he had in
the house for fear she would use it.
He admits that he has beon unmanly
enough at different times to use personal
violence torvard her, and that ou one oc
casion her screams brought in the neigh
bors.
Now that the woman has recovered it
is not believed .that the charges against
him will be pressed. When snown the
account of the alleged poisoning as it ap
peared in this morning's Examiner, Sld
dall became very much incensed and ae
nounced it as a tissue of falsehoods. He
has signified bis intention of suing that
paper for libel.

move to the south. His mother and "Mrs.
Smith" would go by train and lie over
land. On October 2G Constable Gross
served divorce papers on Smith, in a suit
instituted in Visalia. Gross testified this
morning that Smith when served with
the papers said:
"Well, what shall I do? That places me
in a bad light."
Mrs. Smith 2 was then living with him
and he told Gross he had married her in
Mariposa County about a month previ
ous. The next lime GroÂ«a saw Smith was
when he went to Orange County to arrest
him.

up. but found he had gone. Siie traced
him to the sonth und had him brought
back. A certified copy of the marriage
license between Smith and Kate English
was introduced in evidence this morning,
and also a statement from the County
Clerk at Visalia, stating that no divorce

Overflow the .Surrounding
F.irmn; Land.
STOCKTON, Cal, Feb. 6.â The hiph
water predicted yesterday came last night
and this morning, causing a partial flood
here, which was contined mainly to that
portion of the city lying south oi Mormon
Channel and west of Center street Almost
all of that section was inundated.
At the Ban Joaquin-street bridge over
Mormon Channel tbe water was Highest
at 8 o'clock, and soon after that began to
subside; bnt lower down the street, and
also in Stockton Channel, the flood kept
on rising and was augmented by the back
water.
During the early hours of the morning
the main field of operations of the flood
fighters was Weber avenue, from its foot
up to the California Navigation and Im
provement Company's sheds. At that
place the Street Department did a first
class piece of work, for which it deserves
praise.
The water began pouring over the ave
nue shortly after midnight and Street
Superintendent Bidwell, who was up all
night with a gang of men, ordered five or
six carloads of gravel brought up from the
Coal Roads track near the bunkers.
The cars were hauled by a dray teem,
und with the gravel a small levee was
speedily built, which prevented the water
from filling the hollows on the south side
of the avenue and eventually flooding
Pleasant Valley, as that portion of the
city weÃt of Center street and between
Mormon and Stockton channels is called
At the flour-mills and the warehouses
preparations were made for a ducking,
and at the steamboat shed all damageable
goods were removed or put upon a safe
elevation. The water began to run over
the flooring of the Navigation Company's
shed at 8 o'clock.
At the Sperry mill trouble presented
itself early, for the water began to pour
up through the rainwater sewers at the
intersection of the avenue and what used
to be called Beaver street. The flow was
stopped by placine sacks of bran over* the
open ings in the Bewer and weighting them
down.
The water 3 are now receding, and all
the channels are lower than they were
this morning.
ItUOKEy LEVEES St:A J. CQLVSA.
J urun Inundated by thÂ« Sacramento
â  . â¢ Jtiter Orerflntp.
\i\ COLUSA, Cal., Feb. The river here
registers Â£6 feet, being about one foot and
nine inches below high water mark. It is
falling slowly.
If it had not been for three large breaks
in the levee on the east side, between Co
lusa and Butte City, the river would cer
tainly have reached a higher mark than
ever before, but the breaks â one about a
mile above Coiusa, another about twelve
miles above and the third just opposite
Princetonâ drew off an immense quantity
of water and eased the lÂ«vees on this side.
There is one vast sea of water from Co
iusa to The Buttes, a distance of seven
miles, and as far north and south as the
eye can reach. Many farms are entirely
under water and stoc^. is being fed on tLe
levees. lovtunately there is no danger of
loss of life.
Below Coiusa, on Grand Island, tbe
lower tales have been rapidly tilting up
for the past few days by tbe bill, or back
water, and it was thought the levees sur
rounding reclamation district 108 would
go out.
Had they not held, the water supply
would have flooded 72,000 aoreÂ« ot the best
land in the Sacramento Valley. As the
storm seems broken and the* levees are
still intact it is believed the greatest
danger has passed.

PETALUMA, Cal., Feb. 6.-Surmises
of a probable tragedy are indulged in by
citizens along the water front, owing to
the mysterious actions of an unknown
dog. This canine has for the past four
days been guarding a portion of the bank
of the creek opposite Camru & Hedges'
planing-mili. refusing alt offers of food,
and at tinu-s wading into the water and
emitting howls of distress. Though *-e
peatedly driven away be constantly re

The animal is a stranger to every one,
and though no one is known to be miss
ing* If animal sagacity goes for aught,
there is small doub; that the dog-,
master met his death, at the point guarded.
Owing to the swift-running current that
would carry a body away, the authorities
are making no efforts to unravel the mys
tery, leaving it for time to solve.

SCHOOL TROUBLE
AT MILL VALLEY
Principal N. B. Country
man Mnst Face Serious
Charges.
Accused by C. E. Cline of 1 1-
Treating and Beating His
Nine- Year- Old Boy.
Denies the Accusation and Insists
Upon an Early Hearing of
the Case.
MILL VALLEY, Cat... Feb. G.-The
greatest excitement has been occasioned
here by charges preferred by Charles E.
Cline, a local painter, against the princi
pal of the Mill Valley public school, N. B.
Countryman, who is al>o a member of the
Marin County Board of Education, for al
leged brutal treatment of Ernest Cline, a
young son of Charles Cline. Young Cline
is about 10 years old and is a scholar in
Miss Mollie Bradley 's class in the Mill
Valley school.
The warrant for Countryman's arrest
was sworn out before Justice of the Peace
J. S. Bellrude of Sauaalito, Justice
Thomas Fottrell ol Mill Valley having re
fused to issue a warrant upon the showing
made by Cliue. Mr. Countryman, upon
learning that Cline bad bronzht charges
against him, immediately gave himself up
and requested a hearing with all possible
bast*. Justice Bellrude set the matter for
bearing for this afternoon at 1 o'clock, at
which time Mr. Countryman, acting as bis
own attorney, pleaded not guilty, and the
case was set for trial ior Monday after
noon.
Mi Cline said that on his son's body
were the marks left by Mr. Countryman's
fists where he had struck the lad. The
child, according to Cline, was covered with
black and blue mark?, the result of the
beatings given him on Wednesday and
Thursday oi this week at the school bouse.
Mr. Countryman, the principal of tlie
school, tells an entirely different story.
He denies that he struck the boy with his
lists and says that be administered to him
only such a whipping as ho deserved, and
that no undue violence was resorted to.
Ho said that young Cline had been creat
ing a disturbance in his class and Miss
Bradley had sent him to the principal to
receive punishment. The boy had his
head bound in strings.whicb Mr. Country
man told him to take off. This he did in
a tit of anger, whereupon the principal ad
ministered to Dim a couple of reminders
with his open hands. The next day the
hoy was sent to him again, and this lime
Mr. Countryman obtained a switch and
was about to whip him, when the lad
crabbed it and brotee it. He gave the boy
a whipping, nevertheless, bat absolutely
deuieh that he kicked him or punched
him.
Attorney r Adolph ' Sylva said this after
noon that he iu tended to Inform tue oiii
cers of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children of the affair. The child

and a Vet Parrot btolrtt.
SAUSALITO, Cau, Feb. 6.â Andrew
Nickles, the proprietor of the Sausalito
Oyster Gfrotto, situated on Water street,
is keeping a silent vigil at the ferry land
ing in the little seaside town and all on
account of a missing parrot. Last night
or early this morning some person broke
the class on the side door leading into the
grotto, and putting an arm through the
opening drew the bolts back and effected
&v entrance.
The crime was not discovered until this
morning when the grotto was opened for
business. It was then seen that robbery
bad been committed, for the midnight
visitors had rifled the money drawer,
whicii contained only $2 in small change.
They also carried away a fine parrot that
was hanging in the grotto. The bird was
confined in a heavy cage and the burglars
took cage and all, but the cage has been
recovered, it was lound on the steps lead
ing to El Monte Hotel, but minus the par
rot. Mr. Nickles wishes to recover the
bird also, ana that is the reason he is on
the lookout at the ferry landing. Besides
tbis precaution he has had a search insti
tuted among the boats in the harbor.
Before Judge Joseph- H. Pryor he swore
out a warrant this morning and is ready
to place the burglar under arrest as soon
as he appears with the parrot.

Assessments for the Local

The Southern and Union Pac.fic

Chairman C aid well.
Agents of Northern Roads Say It Is
Only Just That the Others
Pay Larger Rates.
A warm meeting of tbe members of the
San Francisco and Oakland Passenger As
sociation occurred yesterday, in the asso
ciation office in the Mills building. It
was all about a raise in the pro rata of
the expenses lor carrying on the associa
tion levied by the new auditing com
mittee.
The local association is subordinate to
tbe Transcontinental Association, and is
made up of representatives of the trans
continental roads in tnis City and Oak
land. It is, like the parent association, for
the purpose of maintaining rates. To pay
the expenses of maintaining the organi
zation assessments are levied on all the
roads.
The assessment is changed from time to
time on the general basis of the business
done by each road. In winter the roads
running through , the warm belt, like the
Southern Pacific, do the larser part of the
business.
The new auditing committee, composed
of Mr. Rice of the Great Northern. Mr.
Sanborn of the Burlington and Mr. Sned
daker ot the Rio Grande Western, got to
gether the other day and reapportioned
the percentage of the exDenses. They
raised the Southern Pacific's rale from 18
to 21><Â£ per cent; the Union Pacific's from
13 to 18 per cent, and the Santa Fe's from 11
to 14 per cent. The other roads, of which
there are SOme seven or eipht.were as
sessed at from 5 to 8 per cent. -

MR WALLER CHUCKLED.
Shopped for Surgical Instruments and
Undercut Supervisor Kottanzi.
School Director Waller chuckled audi
bly yesterday concerning his success in
underbidding Dr. Kottanzi for surreal
instruments for the Receiving Hospital.
His original bill was for $254. Dr. Rot
tanzf, as a member of. the Health and
Police Committee of the Board of Super
visors, held up this bill as excessive. Then
Mr. Waller told the committee that he
was compelled by Dr. Weill to purchase
at one place and bad not been givten the
option to look around for lower *pricÂ«s.
Then Dr. Rottanzi and School Director
Waller both went about seeking prices
for the instruments needed and, accord
ing to Mr. Waller, the result was as fol
lows: Rottanzi $168, exclusive of a $7 in
strument which he overlooked; Waller
$160 25, including the whole lot' needed.
This is about $84 less than the firÃt bill.

WHERE IS THE
SCHOONER VINE?
The Trader Was Expected
Back Here Last De
cembar.
Her Chronometer Got Out oi
Order and a New One Was
Procured at Corinto.
H'S Net Been Heard of Sines Liav
i g the Central American
Port.
Where is the schooner Vine? That is
the question that is being debated by the
members of the J. F. Cunningham Com
pany and also by the Irienda and rela
tives of Captain Luttrell. She is a slow
sailer, but, giving her all dvÂ« allowances,
the vessel should have reached the Caro
line group eariy in November, but on
December 10, when J. V. Hollander left
Kusai for Hongiong, there had been no
news from the Vine. Tne general suppo
sition is that she ha 3 been becalmed in
the southern seas, ami that in a few days
Captain Luttrell Will be heard from.
The schooner Vine sailed from San
Francisco on June 12 last. At the time 01
her charter there wns some car^o engaged
for Central America, and, as it had to bj
I'arnea, the vessel stopped at Guaymas.
At that lime Captain Luttreil cabled tiiat
vis chronometer was useless, the main
spring having broken, and asked that iho
Pacitic Mail Steamship Company be in
structed to either loan or sell him one.
Tba a^ent of the Vine saw Mr. Schwenn, !
and that gentieman declined to lend any
assistance. Tne reasons he gave could not
be gainsaid, and Mr. Cunningham had
to retire without any prospect of securing
a chronometer.
In his explanation Mr. Schwerin said :
"Each of the Pacific Mail Company's
boats carries two chronometers. Should
one get out of order there is always the j
second* to fall back upon. If we loaned j
one to the VÂ»ue and the other one doling j
the run up the coast got out of or-ier â 
where woum the company be in the eveut
of an accident and the subsequent law
suits? 1 '
Seeing that nothing could be done, and
that every day'sue.ay meant alossot hun
dreds or dollar*, Aaent Cunningham
cabled to Captain Ltutceil to use his own
judgment and do the be.<t he cuulJ in the
circumsiauces. The iaiter used his watch
as a chronometer and reacue 1 Connto,
where he was able to purchase the desired
timepiece. After leaving Corinto the
Vine has never been spoken, and the cap
tain's friends assert tnat tue instrument
! bought in Corinto was useless, and that
| the schooner may be huudr-ds of miles out
! of her course.
The Cunningham Company fully ex
rected to receive favorable news by the
City of Peking, but their hope-i were
dashed to the ground when J. V. Mel
lander, the islanu trader, informed them
that up to December 10 last there had been
nothing heara of the Vine. Nevertheless
the owners have every confidence in the
safely of the vessel and expeci tier back at
any time. Th-y re.isou that calms and
Jigrut winds have uievaileU and that ihe
chronometer purchased by Captain Lut;
reil may not have been correct. In that
event he would not only have gone out of
his c jurae, but would have b;e:i unable
to make time. The relatives and friends
of the men on the sciiooner are neverthe
less anxious over her non-appearance.
Henry Powers had a narrow e?cape on
ihe water front yesterday. He and an as
sistant were on a staging calking the
sides of the bark Coiusa. One of the men
made a move and the staging gave way
throwing Powers into tue water. He
could not swim and was going down for
the third time when C. C Pratt, collector
for the Harbor Commissioners, seized a
life buoy and almost threw it over the
drowning man's head.
Powers seized it and held on until Pratt
with a long pick pole managed to get him
alongside (he wharf, aiier which lie was
hauled up on the wharf. The Colusa sails
lor Puget Sound to load lumber for Syd
ney, N. S. W-i to-morrow, bat Powers
says he will sue the captain for damages
before the vessel gets away. According to
him the staging on which he was working
was insecure and the rope thai held it de
fective.
The tug Vigilant was put on the dry
dock y-3terday for a general overhauling.
She will be in commission r.gain to-mor
row and then Captain John bilovich says
he will be ready to give any boat in the
bay a brush.
The Czarina completed her first round
trip with the Whiiram *heel yesterday.
Unusually heavy weather was experienced,
but nevertheless the steamer did well. Oa
the run down the coast she overhauled the
steam-schooner Alliance, but the wind
shifted around and the latter setting all
>aii was able to draw away again. Should
fine weather prevail during the next voy
age the new wheel will be given a thor
ough test.
The old pilot-house of the revenue cut
ter Perry, that was recently overhauled,
now adorns the deck of the tramp steamer
Progreso. It is a decided improvement,
and the helmsmen of the tramp are more
than glad that Providence Bent the house
their way.
The steam schooner CleonÂ« got in from
San Peiro in ballast yesterday, and left a
few hours later for Crescent City to load
lumber for San Francisco. The Cleone is
a regular trader to this port, but when a
load of pies and lumber were required at
San Pedro her owners sent her there direct
from Crescent City.
The steam schooner Pasadena was
caucht in the northwester yesterday and
had to seek shelter in Drak-s Bay. Later
on the wind died out a little and she pro
ceeded on her way.
Dunsmuir & Co. are minus a valuable
horse. Yesterday the animal became
fractious and backed the cart to which it
was attached oft the whari. The animal
and cart sank to the bottom, and later the
wrecker Whitelaw hauled everything to
the surface again. The horse was un
hitched and towed out into the stream
and cast adrift. The wagon and harness
were taken to the stabl-g.

THE MURDER
OF LITTLE PETE
Preliminary Examination
of Wing Sing and
Chin Poy.
The Evidence Shows That the
Former Was Seen Walking
Hurriedly Away.
So Far Nothing Has Been Adduced to
Incrimin r.e Chin Poy in
tlie Murder.
The preliminary examination of Wing
Sing and Chin Poy, charged with the mur
der of Little Pete on Saturday night, Jau
uary 23, w .b begun before Juace Joachim
sen yesterday morning. Attorney Robert
Ferral appeared for the prosecution and
Attorney J. M. Smith for the defense.
The evidence did not show that either
of the defendants] was in the barbershop,
817 Washington street, when the shots
were iired, but Wing Sing was positively
identified ua seen walking hurriedly from
the shop in the direction of Waverly place.
Wong Cb&ong, one of the barbers in the
shop, was the first witness called. He
testified he had been dressing a customer's
queue and bad gone into the rear room to
empty the water from a basin when he
heard the shooting. He did not see the
man who fired the shots. There were
three barbers and two customers in the
shop ai the time. L:ttle Pete ha:l been
there for ten or twenty minutes. He did
not see any man loitering outside the
sh -vji-t nrlor to the shooting.
Dr. Morgan, the autopsy physician at
the Morgue, described the course of the
two bullets through the brain and the one
through the heart, and that any one of
the three was fatal.
Wong Chick Cheonp. another barber,
who was shaving 1/itlle Pete, testified
thai he had just finished washing his
queue and wa*- in theÂ«rear room emptying
the basin, when he heard three or four
shots. By the time he got bactc to the
shop nobody was in sight.
D. B. Hutchins, col ector for a pewing
machine company, living at 326 O'Farrell
street, testified that on the night in ques
ENSIGN "W. J. LEWIS, Mercy-Box Secretary of the Pacific Coast
Division, Salvation Army*
tion he wa* staniiins on the northwest
corner of Washington street and Waverly
place. He board a shot and walked
diagonally across Washington street to
the center of the car track. He saw a
Chinese ii; front of the duor of the barber
shop, who hurried down the street. He
was uione at first, but was immediately
followed by another Chinese. He did not
see any one come out of the door of
the shop. He identified Wing Sing as the
Chinese he first -aw walking hurriedly
from the shop. There were no Chinese
between the oarl>er-shop and the point
where he was t<tandine. Wing Sing was
not running, but walking hurri<Â»dlv. He
could not positively identify Chin Poy as
tiie other Chinese."
On cross-examination he said he located
the place from the sounds of 'he shots.
He got a fair side view of Wing Sing's
face. He could not say that Chin Poy
was the second man, as he looked to see if
he had a gun in his hand, and conse
quently did not see his face.
Jurnts Bribes, a colored Pullman porter,
testified that he came out of Ross al.ey,
which lx immediately fronting the barber
shop, when he saw the flash and heard th â¢
first shot in ihe burDe r-shop. He got out
as far as the car track and heard the other
two shots. He saw two men standingout
side and some Chinese coming out or the
place. He <iid not know whether or not
the door was open. One Chinese who
came out walked fast down the hill and
two or throe others followed him.
Wiot Sing Was piaced alongside six
other Chinese, and Briggs at once identi
fied him.
In cross-examinAtion he said he did not
see any one coming out of the shop.
"If tive men were in the shop," said
Attorney Smith, "how could you fail to
see Wing Sing come out?"
''1 may be mistaken about Wing Sing,"
replied Briggs, "but I don't think so."
The case was continued until next
Thursday.

NOBLE MISSION OF
MAJOR WINCHELL
He Will Improve the Home

Major and Mrs. Winchell, superintend
ents for the Salvation Army social work
on the coast, have been active since their
arrival two weeks ago. They have spent
their time investigating the various social
institutions in and around San Francisco
and are much pleased with the progress
that has been made in tits past.
Tnev propose to put these institutions
upon improved line?, which will facilitate
greater re?ults among the epecific classes
of unfortunate people for which they have
been founded Also to open new depart
ments which will help to carry the bur
dons of the poor.
Major Winchtll, in company with Lieu
tenant-Colonel Keppel, spent iast Sunday
at Golden Gate farm for discharged
prisoneis in ban Ramon Valley. He finds
the men happy and willing to work, the
remuneration they receive being the
kindness of the army officers. The men
toil from 5:30 A. M. until dark. The result
is that in the iast five weeks they have
plowed 125 acres and put about half of it
to seed. Seven men are on the farm at
the present time, and several applicants
to come are being considered and will
probably ne received this week.
Major W.inchell is very anxions to add
to the cheerfulness of the bom - by put
ting in home furniture and papering the
wall*. A driving-cart, sewing-machine
and a cow are very much needed for this
instiiution.
The army hopes to be able to test the
characters of hundreds of this mosi un
fortunate class of men and recommend
them to -positions. Major Wi:ict:ell also
is anxious to persuade Judges to send
first offenders to tne home and save them
from the stigma of the felons.
Extensive arrangements are being made
for the formal opening of a social insti
tute for the benefit of poor men, and
a general headquarters to reach out
and help toe quite po. rof the City. The
plans are not fuliy matured as yet, but a
labor bureau and woodyard are among
the proposed departments of this insti
tute, and a general toning up of tne phy
sical, moral, social and spiritual condition
of those who seek refupe in this place
may be espected. When completed it
will accommodate about 400 men.
The firsi floor will be ;:ivon to the poor
est ana most helpless, and they will be
encouraged to seek the superior benelits
of the home. The major is hopeful of
building in the characters of thousands
of men and helping them to employment
through his tn?titu;e.
Several hundred dollars are yet needed
to secure the proper equipments before
the opening on Washington's birthday.
Several prominent business men will
,Â«peak at the opening of the institute at
10:30 a. M . February 22, and a remarkable
social exposition with many interesting
innovations and side lights will be held
at the Metropolitan Temple in the even-
ing.
A very interesting means of raising money
for the support of these charitable institu
tions which are not self-supporting is
called the mercy box.
These boxes are to be given out free and
placed on one's tabie, so that while the
people bow their heads in gratitude fur
their food they may also put a penny in
for food and shelter for a starving brot' er
or sister; or with that class who are not
religious enough to say grace they can act
grace by dropping in their smallest coin.
Fifty thousand of these boxes nave been
placed among all classes of people in the
United Stated during the last six months.
Tne army expects to put in 50,000 more
during the coining year.
Ensign Lewis Ã¼bs charge of the mercy box

quarters are at 1139 Market street.

Daan Peck Arrives.
Dean Peck, field superintendent of the
Chris-tian Alliance, arrived In Oakland
from the southern portion of the State

I the Christian Alliance there will deliver a
1 sermon in one of the prominent Metho

URGES ACTION ON
THE LEGISLATURE
The Union League Club
Passes Two Strong
Resolutions.
la Favor of a Primary Law and
Requesting the Removal of
Duckworth.
The Union League Club, at a general
meeting held on Wednesday evening,
February 3, by a unanimous vote passed
the following resolutions:
Whereas, It is well known that the pri
mary elections heretofore h*-ld in this City
have been, generally, fraudulently conducted,
and ii<at great dissatisfaction exists regarding
ths same, so much so that many of the best
citizens of ail parties have reiuVed to partici
pate la the said so-called primaries; and
whereas, we believe that in order to have
good government and honest officials we must
have honebt and iairiv conducted primaries,
in which all our citizens c:jn with propriety
participate; there. ure be it
Resolved, That the Legislature now In ses
sion Le and it is earueswy requested to pass
a primary-election law requiring nil political
parties holding a primary ejection to nold all
Mich primaries on the same day. and that all
the saieguards, penalties and provisions govÂ«
erning eenerul eieclions shall apply thereto.
Whereas, In the opinion oi tnis club. S. J.
Duckworth, chief clerk of the present Assem
bly ot this State, betrayed the confidence re
posed in him by tne Republican members oi
said Assembly, by appointing a larger number
oi employes thnn was necessary for the pur
pose of organization, thereby wantonly wast
ing the people's money and bringing discredit
on the good name of the Republican party;
therefore, be It
Resolved, That the said S. J. Duckworth
should be removed and that the Legislature
now in session ought to pass such laws as will
in future prevent the placing ou the tem
porary roll any greater number of persons
than is actually necessary to properly conduce
the business ot the Assembly.
Resolved, That copies of these resolutions be
forwarded to the President pro tern, of tie
Senate, the Speaker of the Assembly, the Re
publican State Central Committee and thÂ«
press. Kobekt A. Friedrich, President.
J. M. Litchfield, Secretary.

DAMIEN ENJOYED
HIS VACATION

Hobart Sake in a
Big Gallop.
Salvation, a Hot Tip, Finished
Second, in Front of
Schiller.
Collins Finished Last and His R cc
R mains a Mysteryâ R -ddingtoa
Hard Pressed by J 0 C.
"With magnificent weather and a card
that would bear comparison with a sum
mer-day programme on one of the big
Eastern tracks, there is little wonderment
that avast assemblage paid respects to
the closir.j: day of the two weeks' meeting
at Ingleside yesterday. Tiie lirst fo - ,ir
events run off simply whetted the appe
tite of the crowd for the grand lot that
lined tip in the Hobart stake, a handicap
over one and a sixteenth miles, with a
gross vaiue of $15.X). Eight horses an-
Bwe red the bu^le call, and they were the
pink of the lot now in training here. At
h'r--; glance use weights looked splendidly
adj'.-.stfd. Sail Hildreth's pair. Lucky
Djg and St. Lee, coupled in the betting,
had the call, the books holding them at
2 tol.
The stable was later obtainable at the
enriching price of 7to 2. Pat Dunne, the
astute Western horseman bad two entered
also, Damien and Captive. Some time ago
the ii r st named horse cot to racing badly
end Mr. Dunne stated that be would turn
him out at pasturage. Satisfied that
Damien was eatins rich sreea alfalfa on
some honest countryman's ranch the
handicapper placed 100 pounds acainst
the animal's name. Noticing (.tie weight.
Mr. Dunne Jiad D-imien ha-tiiy placed
aboard a handcar, iro.ted him around the
track once or twice, told him to be coed;
the hor?e nodded assent and Mr. Dunne,
in a joking mood, just scratched Captive.
Tod Sloan had the leg up and strange to
relate Damien went to the post a 13 to 5
choice.
Willie Sims had tbe monnt on Argen
tina, but it seemed to cause no commo
tion, for the mare receded ia the betting.
A paddock whi-per on Salvation caused
the odds against Marcus D ly's horse to
tumble from 15 down to 7. Barn y
Schreiber' * Schiller opened at fours and
remained at thf-se od<i<.
At tne post Mr. Harvey, after a slight
delriy, sent the bunch away to a beautnul
start. Lucky Do^ dipped away out in
front and the crowd said, "It's all over."
It vras a vain prediction tor Damien over
took the Dog before the bond for the wire
was reached, and then it was all over.
Pat Dunne's horse won with pounds to
spare irom Salvation, who ran an excel
lent race under Cash Sloan's persuasive
uri;inp. Schilier responded earaeh* in tue
stretch ana beat St. Lee out for the show.
Ti.e va'ue of the stake to the winner was
$1150. Considering tne condition of the
tracic, which was slow, the time â 1:51^' â
was fast.
Of liie first choices sent to tho post three
were successful â Geyser, Damien and Iled
dington. H. Mariin ana T. Sloan were
eacn successful in landing a winner.
Dan Honig's Brametta carried the bulk
of the coin to win die openinsj sii-furionp
dash, but Snowdown, tiie 3 to 1 second
choice, took the lead soon after tne start

and galloppd in an easy winner from the
favorite. Franco, a6oio 1 shot, was third.
An ordinary lot of platers stampeded
over to the post in the six-furlong spin
that followed, and Foremost, at odds of 5
to 1, found no difficulty whatever in beat
ing out the 13 to 5 favorite, Scimitar, rid
den by Jones.
Ed Corrigan's colt Geyser was the hot
test sort o a favonto for the mile run for
three-year-olds. He was played to a
standstill at odds of 3 to 5 and 1 to 2 and
won by the narrowest of margins. Imp.
Sain was allowed to cut out the pace and
the black colt, failing; to back up in the
stretc;), hunc on with great gameness
and acknowledged defeat by but a nose in
1:45%. Lincoln II was third, in front of
Arrezzo.
The greatest disappointment of the day
hap: ened over the resuU of the mile sell
ing affair for all ages, and in the opinion
of many Collins, the S to 5 favorite, was
nothing more than a beautitu.Uy boiled
"lobster." Still the horse is not sound,
and his mis rable showing may have be n
due lo physical disabilities. He chased
his field for half a mile and then in de
spair Sloan relrainei :rom furt er â¢'low
ering the bucket when the well had run
dry."
Jscbe Murphy carried the money at odds
of sto 2, and stepped over the line first
less than two lencths in advance of Day
light. Tom Griffin's mare Addie Bu
chanan was third.
With ail the best of the weights the
mile and a half hurdle handicap went to
Reddinjron, the 7 to 5 favorite, piloted by
George Cuchran, wnicti in a hard drive
beat J O C a neck. Show honors went to
Go.d Dust.
Dunne's Outlay was the pick ol the tal
ent to win the three and a half furlong
scram b.e for two-year-oliis. but in a fierce
drive was defeated by Sir William, which
promising youngster secured the decision
by a head.

SIGMUND BEEL TO GO.
Next Week San Francisco Will Lose One of Her Best-Known
The news is jnst beginning to leak out that Sigmund Beel is going away to Europe.
He may be gone a year, be may be zone iwo or turee; there is no Knowing. Mr. Beel
does not even know himself, but it is quite sore ihat he will not return home till 1898.
When asked about bis ueporture yesterday, the best known of California-born
violinists said: "Yes, I leave i.ere on the loth of this month and cannot say positively
when I shall return. My object it is to see and hear '
"And play," was suggested.
"Yes. I shall play ais >." replied Mr. Beel, smiling. "Lately I have given so many
lessons that I feel I want to get away from it all and go where I can hear new music,
new artists and obtain new ideas. You know the leeling of rustmess that comes from
working continually in one groove."
Su-muÃd Beel did not say anything ebout his ambition*, bnt his musical friends
predict that when je once Rets to Europe lie will May a iong time. When he settled
here sii years ago, one of Joachim's favorite pupils, fresh from successes in Germany
and Holland, a great many people said that the young Calitornian was limiting his
talents by settiinK down to local teaching and concert work instead of remaining in
the concert held. Hertid noi listen to them, however, but plunged into local work
with an ardor and a will which have borne t: e.r fruit in the development of San
i rancisco musical "a^te.
On January 17, ISSI, Siground Beel, in conjunction with Mrs. Carmichael-Carr,
pave the hrst of toe Saturday Popular Concerts, which remained a feature of San
*rancisco musical life till last season, when the fiftieth concert of the series was
g.ven, and a reception, tendered by a number of prominent society music-lovers, was
given to the artists after the performance. Long before the juoilee concert Louis
Heine lsad associaied bim-elf with Mr. Beel and Mrs. Carr and the Sizmund Beel
string quartet had been organiz d. This string qnartet did kni-ht's service in intro
ducing new compositions by living composer? to this City. It was tne Carr-Bee!
"pops which largely helpe > to popularize Grieg's chamber music here. Brahms,
Saint-baens, Godard, Arthur Foote an. l many other living composers of chamber
music also had their new chamber music played "for the first time'in San Francisco"
at these concerts.
Many people have asked wbv the Carr-Beel "pops" were abandoned this season,
me reason is that Sigmund Beel was making arrangements to go away, and did no'
care to enter into any extended concert engagement. Music- lovers will regret his
departure, v it will deprive tuis Ciiy of one of its best concert arritta and one who
has always been an enthusiastic worker ia the cause ol symphony and classical
chamber concerts.

C. HEROLD ADMONISHED
Judge Carroll Cook Came Neai
Committing a Witness for
Perjury.
Denied a N wspaper Interview and
Then W.s Compjll?d to Admit
That It Was Truj.
"Step this way, Mr. Heroid, I wish to
speak wit. 1 ! you a moment," said Judse
Carroll Cook on Friday af;ernoon. The
jury in the case of Thomas Reynolds bad
jus; returned a verdict of guilty of
burglary in the second degree, with a rec
ommendation to the mercy of the court.
Charles Heroid had been the main wit
ness for the prosecution, and had em
p.oyed Attorney Alexander Campbell Jr.
to assist Deputy District Attorney Hoa
mer in conducting the triaL In his main
testimony Kero:d seemed to be anxious to
make a strong case against the prisoner,
and Rave a mass of testimony that found
no oorroboration in the testimony of the
other witnesses.
Judge Cook waited until HeroM ad
vanced to the bar, ani then said: "I
ordered your return to-day, sir. for the
reason that I was yesterday convinced
that you had committed periury, and it
was my intent. on to oraer you into ens
tody lor tr:al on a charge of teiony. You
have voluntarily come forward, nowever,
i and sMbstituted partial troth for false
hood, and this is conMdered in mitigation
of your offense. If you had not mads
your explanation in this court to-day you
would at th.s moment be in a position to
answer to a criminat charge in Â»ome de
partment of the Superior Court. In view
of the circumstances and your partial
reparation you will not be harshly dealt
with. For this you ought to be thank
ful."
Uerold lost no tin^e in getting out of the
courtroom.
A short time before Herold had Rey
nold.* arrested he was interviewed by a re
porter, and said :
I sospected Reynolds and was bound to get
a confession from mm. Wnen I found him in
the saloon I became angry and excited. I
dragged him to tne slab.c and told him I
wanted to know all about the burglary. When
he wouldu't tell me I beat mm. Ton know, a
man will get extited sometimes. I then tied
k rope arounj his neck, but I didn't try to
ha: g him. 1 ju>t thruw the other end over
the beam. No, 1 didn't puil him up. Ke kept
moving his head from oue aids to another,
and that is how he got the mar*s on his throat.
He became frightened aud was commencing
to confess, whe.i Leopold came iat> the stable.
At the time Heold was tirst on the
stand he denied saying these things, but
he was disputed by Mr. Slevin, the re
porter, who wa- corroborated by other
witnesses, and Herold was compelled to
auuiit that Mr. S.ev^n was li^.jtanJ he
was wrong. This was the cause wuich led
to Jud^e Cook's admonition in regard to
.el. ing the truth.
In commenting on Herold'a testimony
in his argument before the jury Attorney
Eddy said :
I never saw so pitiable a spectacle cs that
mÂ«n Herold as he appiared on the witness
stand this morning. iou will reinumber,
gentlemen of the jury, that yesterday he
swore that he did not have a conversation
with James Slevin ani did not then admit
that he haa hang ud the boy Reynolds for the
purpose of forciug a coniescioii. In five
minutes alter court adjourned yesterday
Herod learned that he was in danger of being
convicted oi perjury for his false testimony.
He did not know at tirst that we were ready to
overwhelm him with the proof of his perjury,
tiUi when he fouad oui Ms danger he too* the
advice of his attorney and sneaked back to the
witness-;ta::d with the excuse of a mac who
knew that he had tied, aad tried to explain
,hat his memory was contused, and now he
wasn't sure whether o: not he had any such
eon venation with Mr. S.evin. Finally he vir
tual y admitted to you and to me that he did
tell Mr. Slevin exacily what he denied yester
day.
The case has attracted a great deal of
attention from residents of the Potrero,
and the counroom was rilled by spectators
from that part of tne City.

(Take Elevator), San Francisco, Cal.BUTLER IN
CANADA
He Took Part in the Riel
Rebellion Over Twelve
Years Ago.
WAS A MEMBER OF THE
MOtJNTED POLICE.
Fortunately Missed Taking Part
in Any Actual Fight
ing.
ENLISTED FOR A TEEM OF
THREE YEARS.
In Future No Visitors Will Be Per
mitteJ to S--e Him Without
a Special Order.
Hundreds of people were disappointed
s: not being able to obtain admittance to
the City Prison to see Butler or Ashe yes
terday.
The Chief of Police had given instruc
tions that no one should be permitted to
enter the prison unless with a permit from
headquarters. Butler was a prisoner of
the United States Marshal and was not on
public exhibition.
Tne re.-ult was that only a favored few
gained admittance and Butler had a relief
from being stared at by crowds of men
aud women, as on the previous four days.
A large crowd novered around the
entrance to the prison, and policemen had
repeatedly to drive them back to enable
people who had business in the prison to
eet entrance. So determined were the
people to keep on watch for a possible
chance of getting a peep at Butler some
â¢way or other that the policemen became
exasperated and the gardener was asked
to turn his hose upon them, which had
the effect of scattering them.
Yeserday morning Mrs. Eliza Weyser,
231 Third street, accompanied by her
daughter, called at police headquarters.
She said that five or six years ago she
kept a boarding-house on Elizabeth street,
near the park. Sydney, N. S. W. She re
niembered distinctly having a lodger of
the name of Butler, and, being struck by
the resemblance of toe pictures of Butler
that had appeared in the papers, she was
convinced he was the same man.
Mrs. Weyser whs taken to the prison
and introduced to Butler, and after a brief
conversation with him she returned to the
Chiefs office. She said she was not ex
actly positive as to the identity of the
man. His voice sounded familiar and his
general appearance answered to that of
her firmer lodger, but it was so long ago
that it was hard to say whether he was the
man or not.
The man stopped at her house one year,
and was away for weeks at a time. No
one knew u-hat his business was, and as
he always had plenty of money and
uressed well there was a mystery about
Lim. One rtay lie disappeared and she had
not seen or heard of him since.
.. Butler was closeted with his attorneys
for some time yesterday afternoon, pre
paring for the hear ng before Commis
sioner Heacock to-morrow mornine.
. Last night two rival owners of phono
graphs called at the Cay Prison each with
a piece of music aod his pet phonograph.
They wanted Butler to sins a song into
each phonograpn, but he refused to do it,
and they had to retire discomfited. Each
tned to outbid the other, and by that
means they failed in their object.
James Maim, a sailo r on the Swanhilda,
â was abo a visitor last night, and he and
Butler nad a long chat together. Maim
was on the second mate's waich during
the voyage, and Butier was on the first
mate's watch. Maim said after he had
quit talking with Butler that Butler came
aboarJ at Newcastle with an unusually
large clothes-bag and a small bag, and
after tne ship waa under way and they be
gan to get acquainted Butler produced a
captain's certificate under which he had
shipped in the name of Lee Weller.
He was out of money and being desirous
of reaching America quickly for family
reasons he shipped before the mast. He
had two good suits of clothes in his bag,
some shirH and other things better than
I sailor u-ually has and a good deal of jew
elry, which he showed to Ins messmates. He
formed a spfcial intimacy with Maim and
waa a hearty shipmate, offering Maim
the use of his oilskins during the rainy
weather.

with his wife, and was, to use the expres
sion of W. T. Nuell, who was intimate
with him, a good thing for men with
schemes. Captain Nuell says:
"The Captain was easy going, but his
wife had lots of ambition. She gave les
sons in vocal music and in one of tne Back
| Bay churches sang for nesirly two years.
They remained here till August, li-'.t.'i.when
they went to Johannesburg, where Mrs
Welder died within a year.
"Now to illustrate the sort of a person
the captain was and how easily be was
taken In I want to tell you one of his ex
periences while in Boston. He was out of
work and saw an advertisement for real
estate agents.
"He thought he was qualified for the
position and was told that he couid have
the position by depositing $203. He al
ways had plenty of money forthcoming
when it was needed and acceded to the de
mand. He paid down the $200 and was
to receive $18 a week for his services. At
the end of the first week he was dis
charged and tried m vain to compel the
men to return the deposit. He would not
prosecute the proprietor of tbe place.
The notorious Doc Langley was arrested
afterward and is now up on a long sen
tence.
"A short while afterward ho went into
the canJy business with a sharper and
dropped several hundred dollars more.
He reported the case to the polic , but re
fused to prosecute. He also got caught
on a big block of valueless gold mining
stock."
Nuell has a large number of letters
from Johannesburg and Sydney from the
captain.
BUTLER IN OREGON.
On the Scottish Glens-Evaded a
Warrantâ A Theory.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 6.-Butler, the
Australian murderer now under arrest in
San Francisco, sailed from here in March,
1892, as Boatswain Ashe in the British
ship Scottish Glens.
The records of the British Vice-Consul's
office show that Ashe secured his dis
charge from the British ship Star of
Russia to take the boatswain's berth on
the Scottish Glens, the opportunity for
promotion evidently actuating him in the
change.
While the Scottish Glens was lying at
Astoria, waiting to get to sea, a sa.lor piv
ing the name of Butler became involved
in a fight, and a warrant for his arrest on
a charge of assault was issued. It was
never served, however, the man disap
pearing.
Joseph Peterson, an ex-sailor Btopping
at the Scandia House* here, says this
evening's Telegram, was at that time
working on a railroad being built out of
"One morning when I came down to
the main aupuly station at the ijead of the
Lewis and Clark River," said Peterson,
"I was accosted by a sailor-appearing
chap, who asked me as to the chauce for
work. I referred him to the foreman,
who, after a few words with the man,
sung out to me to take him along and
work him with my gang. The fellow ap
peared m trouble, starting at every sound
coming up behind him. I did not pay
much attention to this, thinking him a
probable deserter. He had no blankets,
and somehow, feeling for him, I took him
to bunk with me. During the night he
told me bis story. He said his name was
Ashe, but that under another name he
had sot into trouble in Astoria, and thai
the officers were after him. I remember
distinctly his expressing regret at the
good berth he had lost through getting
into this ecrape.
"The next morning when I started for
the landing with the t>ack train he begged
of me not to take him along, but tinU him
work with some outlying camp, saying he
was afraid to Le seen by the men coining
and KOing on the steamer from Astoria."
A theory has been formed thai Butler,
for whom the warrant was issued, and
Ashe were one and the same man; that
Ashe lindinu himself in trouble deserted
the Scottish Glens, and making his way
to the railway camp succeeded in earning
sufficient money to get him to Ban Fran
cisco, where he found employment in the
laundry.
BUTLER IN CANADA.
He Was a Member of the Northwest
Mounted Police.
Butler gave some additional facts in
connection with his past lile yesterday
which are of the greatest interest.
A few days ago he stated that he was in
Quebec, Canada, in 1888, and yesterday he
pave some farther particulars of his life
in that country.
During the Kiel rebellion in the Cana

dian Northwest, Butler was a member of
Troop B of the Northwest Mounted Po
lice, stationed in Regina, the capital of
the Northwest Territories.
Troop B, at the time of the rebellion,
was under command of Major Short, a
thorough disciplinarian, who was some
years later killed in an explosion in Que
bec.
The rebellion broke out in March, ISBS,
the first overt act being committed by the
halfbreeds under Gabr.el Dumart, Reil's
lieutenant, on March 26. at a place calle.l
Duck Lake. The nalfbreeds attempted to
take possession of some stures under
transport to Fort Carlton. Superintendent
Crozier. with eighty men, was in charge of
the stores, and Dumart had about 200 half
breeds. The engagement was sharp and
decisive, the halfbreeds beii:g repulsed,
but not before several on both sides had
been killed and wounded.
Butler was not in this engagement and
did not see any actual fighting during the
rebellion, which la-ted for several weeks,
until Kiel wa> defeated by General Mid
dle ton at Batoche, and a few days later
Poundmaker, the head of the rebellious
Indians, surrendered to Colonel Otter at
Battieford.
"I was stationed at Qu' Appelle cross
ing," said Butler, "with part of our troona
to keep the crossing clear, and knew very
little of what was going on.
"If the halfbreedi had come our way,
however, I suppose we would have been
forced to give them battle, but they didn't,
and we bad an easy time of it.
"I liked the Northwest, although at Re
gina it was pretty cold during the winter,
but one gets used to it.
"1 enlisted for three years, the usual
term, and after it expired I did not care to
re-enli~t.
"I understand that the mounted police
are row more like the cavalry in the
English army and the members have not
such a good time as they used to have."
The rebellion was in 1855 and Butler
was a member of the force then. It is
evident that he was in Canada from that
time till 18S8, when he said he was in
Qu< bee, so that his history is now pretty
well known from 1885 up to the present
time.
He wouid not say what name he went
under while in the mounted police, but
Captain Lees will communicate with the
Canadian authorities and will no doubt
be able to trace him.

FREE MEN
SPEAK OUT
Object to Meet Competition
From Convict
Labor.
A MASS-MEETING LAST
EVENING.
Resolutions Were Adopted Set
ting Forth the Views of
Workers.
PRISON DIRECTORS SHARPLY
CRITICIZED.
President Sonntag of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Asso
ciation Spoke.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation has put itself on record in re
gard to convict labor in a manner most
emphatic. Under its auspices a mass
meeting was held at Metropolitan Tem
ple last evening to discuss this menace to
free industry, and in view of the brief agi
tation the attendance was good. By far
the majority of the auditors were laboring
men.
Julian Sonntag, president of the asso
ciation, briefly stated the objects of the
meeting. John H. Eoberts, secretary,
read the following list of vice-presidents:
James E. Brltt, J. H. O'Brien. P. M. Delany,
T. W. Rivers, T. E. Treacy. L. A. Henry, E. F.
Bert, J. H. Mahony, E. I. Wolfe, L. E. Jones, M.
J' Gale, J. H. Knowles, James A. Wilson, T. W.
Butcher.
Letters were read from Mayor Phelan,
Eugene F. Bert and General John H.
Dickinson.
In a prelude to his address, which was
the main feature of the evening, Mr. Sonn
tag spoke of the objects and scope of the
association which tie represented. Tins
organization, he declared, furnished em
ployment which was the means of sup
port of 50,000 persons within the City and
County of San Francisco.
The Southwick bill was read and ex
plained. Mr. Sonntag said that the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association was
doing what it could to secure its passage.
At San Quentin the prisoners are en
gaged in making jute bags. This has
been a benefit to tne farmers of this State,
but a few months ago, in conversation
with three of the Prison Directors, Mr.
Sonntag was told: "We will divide t:ie
men. We will put 150 to making shoes,
150 more to making buttons and others at
at similar industries." Mr. Sonntag said:
"Not if I can help it."
Mr. Sonntag then referred to the wo rk
of rock-quarrying at Folsom and said :
"We want to protect the quarrymen of
California. They employ 4000 men, and
at Rocklin to my certain knowledge
the quarries have been cio-ed down for
three years on account of the q uarries at
Folsom. I believe in giving every man
lair wages, and he will not get the chance
if he has to come into contact with con
vict labor.'*
"Mr. Warden Aull," continued Mr.
Bonntag, "wants to make a record. He
wants to cut down the pro rata; for the
fact is that our prisons, with 1300 con
victs, cost much more than it does lor
the State of New York witii a like number
of convicts. He wants this bill amended
so that rock broken at Folsom can be used
on every highway, whether in a city or
not. If Warden Aull is successful in car
rying this measure through, at the next
session they will go into the manufacture
of shoes, clothing and other things.
"There is a magnificent water power at
Folsom. There is a bill now before the
Legislature to consolidate the two prisons,
and when these 2100 men are confined to
gether, the cry will go up, "What shall we
do with oui prisoners? They are biting
their finger-nails and suffering from de
mentia.'
''I say let them bite their finger-nails.
The problem is not how we can era
ploy the convicts, but now we can keep
our honest laboriug men employed."
The following resolutions were then put
and adopted :
The peoi.lo of San Francisco in mass-meet
ing asst'uibk-<:, do unanimously adopt the fol
lowing resolutions:
That we indorse the Southwick bill, now
pending in Congress, which prohibits the
transportation of convict-made goods from,
one State to another.
That we also indorse the bill now before the
Legislature known as House bill 282 and that
we ask all legislators to support the measure,
and that the secretary of. this meeting be and
is hereby requested to forward a copy of this
resolution to each member of the Legislature
now at Sacramento.
A. j. Oliver voted no and asked permis
sion to speak, which was accorded him.
He said he had opposed the resolution
as a halfway measure and was in favor of
prohibiting all convict labor.
Sam McK.ee, a member of the Molders'
"EXAMINER" CORRESPONDENTS- A YARD OF DAISIES.
Union, was called for. He enthusiastic
ally indorsed the measure and saw in
it a hopeful sign of an understand
ing between the manufacturer and
tlie laborer. "Let us take what they have?
done as an earnest of what they may do,"
he said, "and I believe that every honest
mechanic here to-nicht will heartily in
dorse everything that has been done
here."
Mr. Ponntag stated that personally he
was opposed to ali convict labor.
ASSOCIATED INDUSTRIES.
The Council Moves In Opposition
to Convict Competitive Labor.
An important meeting of the Council of
Associated Industries was held in the
rooms of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association yesterday afternoon,
at whicti the question of convict
labor was the chief matter of dis
cussion. Julian Sonntag, president of
the association, was in tho chair, and
the other members present were James
W, Ksrr and M. J. Keller of the Manufac
turers' and Proctucer.-s' Association, J. A.
Fiicher of the State Board of Trade, E. A. I
Denicke and P. J. Healy of the Mechanics'
Institute. L. F. Lastreto of the Chamber of
Commerce, isador Jacobs of the San
Francisco Fruit Excliance and \V. W.
Montague of the Miners' Association.
The SoutLwick bill, providing against
the transportation of convict-made goO'is i
from one State to another, was favorably |
discussed, but no action was taken, as the 1
bill has already been officially approved
by the council.
Mr. Sonntag called attention to the fact !
that Warden Aull of Folsora was spend- |
ing his time lobbying at Sacramento for j
more machinery to operate the stone I
quarries ac the penitentiary more exten
sively.
A discussion of the pending bill in re
card to the disposi'ion ol the product of
the Folsom quarry followed. This bill, as
originally prepared, provided that the
stone was oniy to be used on coun ty roadÂ«.
in committee it was altered to read "pub
lic roads or highways." The council op
posed this change, as it desires to prevent
the sale of crushed rock to City con
tractors, who use it in competition with i
tho free-labor product.
J. \V. Kerr and P. J. Heal y spoke in fa
vor of presenting a biil to do away with
the use of machinery in the penitentiaries.
Oscar Lewis, who has been looking after
ihe interests of the associated industries
at Sacramento, declared thatsucha meas
ure would meet with much resistance, as
the State had put $30,000 in the quarry at
Folsom.
On motion of Isidor Jacobs, the amend
ment providing that Folsom stone should
be used only on country roads was in
dorsed.
The pending bill, making it obligatory
upon persons having goods for sale,
wholly or partially made by convict labor,
plainly labeled with the name of the
place and the date of their production,
was favorably discussed.
A bill providing for the appropriation
of $300,000 for the improvement of the
river channels of the State was unani
mously approved.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1897.
WITHIN GRASP
OF MILLIONS
Death of F. Hinckley, the
Husband of Florence
Blythe.
Succumbed to an Operation in
Portland, Or , Yesterday
Morning.
His Widow and Dr. Palmer Left This
C.ty at 7 o'Clcck Fr.day Ni^ht,
but Too Late to B; of Service.
Florence Blythe-Hinckley is a widow.
Her young husband, Fritz W. Hincklev,
died in Portland, Or., yesterday from the
effects of a surgical operation performed
by Drs. H. S., Clarence and A. S. Nichols,
three brothers, and Pr. Jeffards, all of
Portland, who were called in to attend
him by his brother, Harry G. Hinckley,
who acrompanied him on h'n trip to Salt
Lake. The Hinckley brothers took this
trip with the avowed purpose of recupera
tion to Fritz, who had been complaining
for some time previously.
They went direct from this City to Fait
Lake, but on their arrival there Fritz's
condition grew worse, and it was deter
mined on the part of the brothers to take
the northern route to Portland and the
steamer from that point home, in the
FRITZ W. HINCKLEY
hope that a short sea trip would benefit
the sick man. But before Portland was
reached his condition became much worse,
and on Tuesday nleht, the day they left
Salt Lake on the Union Pacific. Hinckley
complained of a pain in his stomach, but
thought notning of it until it grew so se
vere that it alarmed his brother, who had
hopes that it would pass off, as did three
other somewhat similar attacks which he
had experienced during the past year and
which had been diagnosed as appendicitis.
On each of those occasions he recovered
without baying to have recourse ;o the
surgeon's knife. Thinking it was a recur
rence of the old complaint his brother
consulted a doctor at one of the towns
they passed through and bad him treat
Hinckley. When they dropped the first
doctor they took anotner ai the next town,
and so on until reaching Portland yester
day morning, when the best sureical aid
was at once called in. Hinckley's condi
tion grew alarmingly worse every nour,
ana after a consultation of surgeons an
operation was determined upon, which
was performed by Dr. Herbert S. Nichols,
assisted by his brother?, Dr. Clarence
Nichols and Dr, A. "S. Nichols, and Dr.
Jeffards. and was for appendicitis and
peritonitis combined.
The opemtion was performed about mid
night on Friday at the Portland Hotel,
and was considered to have been very suc
cessful so far as the operation itself is
concerned, but it had been delayed too
long and the patient was in such a crit
ical condition that but little hopes were
entertained for his recovery.
The attending physicians agreed that
had the case reached them earlier and in
aless feverish and aggravated condition,
incident to the motion of the cars and
mixed treatment, the chances of recovery
would have been almost certain. But,
unfortunately, fate seemed to will it the
other way. For on the run to Portland
the Oregon Railway and Navigation
freight train that was derailed at Colum
bia oeach blocked the train upon which
Hinckley and his brotner were, and they
were tied up at Bonneville for twenty
lour hours, the sick man not being able
to undergo the transfer. When he arrived
in Portland Le was in an - xceedinjily dan
Â«erouj and exhausted condition. His
brother's nerves were so wrought up that
he was almost ill him-elf. r lhe sick man
was removed to the hotel, where the opera
tion was performed.
As soon as Dr. Nichols found the condi
tion of bia putient growing worse a con
sultation of eight oi the most prominent
physical)!) in the City was held. The re
sult of the consultation afforded, as I)r.
Nichols had expected, little hope of his
recovery. A quantity of foreign matter
was removed, but the vermiform appendix
wa.3 not taken out, gangrene having set
in. After the operation death was con
sidered inevitable.
The condition of Mr. Hinckley had been
regularly wired to his heartbroken young
wife at her residence, 1221 California
street, by Harry Hinckley, and when the
last dispatch arrived at 6 o'clock in the
afternoon of Friday Mrs Hinckley de
cided to proceed to Portland to assist her
husband in every way within tier power,
taKinu Dr. Palmer, her family physician,
with her. Both of them started on the 7
o'clock train on that evening, but before
reaching their destination death hud
claimed her Fritz.
Fritz W. Hinckley and Florence Blythe
were married on the 21st of September,
1892, at a period when the younÂ»; m.lJion
aire was in considerable doubt as to
whether she would be declared the iegal
heiress to her father's enormous estate.
At that time almost every young man
in town was laying siege to the youn?
lady's heart, but from among them all
Fritz Hinck.ey was chosen.
At the time of his death he did not own
or control in his own name one dollar's
worth of property belonging to his wife's
fcs<a:e.
Mr. Hinckley's father and two brothers â
Harry G. and Ed â reside in Oakland at
the elegant mansion of the Graysons,
whose daughter is the wife of Harry G.
Hinckley.
Mrs. Hinckley, the mother of the de
ceased, died about tbr^e years ago, since
which time Mr. Hinckley senior has re
sided with his son Hurry.
The body of Fritz Hinckley is to arrive
in this City on Monday, accompanied by
the widow and brother, at which time ar
rangements for the fnnernl will be made.
PORTLAND, Or.. Feb. aâ The remains
of Fred Hinckley lelt for San Francsco
this evening on the Southern Pacific flyer
accompanied by his brother Harry. Mrs.
Hinckfey will be picked up at Shasta
Springs and accompany her late hus
band's remains the rest of the journey.
Funerftl services will be held at the family
residence on California street, while the
interment will be in Mountain View Cem
etery, Oakland.

STREETCAR FARES.
Railroad Employes to Petition the
Legislature Against Any
Redaction.
A larpely attended meeting of delegates
from the different street railroads within
the City was held last nignt in the car*
house, Twenty-ninth and Mission streets.
\V. C. Carpenter was appointed chairman
of the meeting and \V. C. Cook secretary.
A petition, which was circulated among
the employes on Friday ani was signed
by over 3000, was presented to the meet
ins. It would have been signed by all the
employes if there had been time.
The petition reads as follows:
. To the Hc.norab'e the Members of the Legisla-
Gentlemen : . We, the undersigned em
ployes of the various street railroads in opera
tion within the limits of the City and County
of San Francisco, respectfully represent as fol
lows:
That fully 5000 men are at present in the
employ of '.he various 6lreet railroads within
this City and County.
That the wages paid to employes by the con
trolling corporations are barely sufficient to
supply the necessities of life under present
conditions, especially to tnose who have fami
lies dependent upon them.
That the matter now under consideration by
your honorable boay, wnereby it is proposed
to reduce the rate of fares on streetcars, is
detrimental to the interest and welfare of
every street-railroad employe, inasmuch hs
the passage of such a measure would entail a
corresponding reduction in the scale of wages
paid to employes by the various companies,

I 'â¢'. Relying on the report ot the committtee
. and the personal, assurances of James
I Eva, Barling and Pentecost, the board of
â¢" directors ol the Alaska Improvement
Company authorized the signing of the
Contract for the sale and transfer of the
.-. property..
. .' Then came the surprise, for the com
*â¢" plaint avers that the report of James Eva

. and that the agreement was not genuine,
but was made for tbe purpose of imposing
on the board of directors of the Alaska

GRAND OPERA
HERE IN MARCH
A Big Parisian Company
to Give Twenty Per-
formances.
Wealthy Citizens Back of the
Project With a Guarantee
of $ifo,ooo
Five Performances a Week at the
California T.ieaterâ Seats to
Be $i. $2 and $3
San Francisco is to have grand opera by
a fine French opera company from Paris.
Ihere will be twenty operas in all. 'Five
wiil be given each week for fonr consecu
tive weeks. The first will be presented
between the 10th and 14th of March. All
the operas will be given in the California
Theater.
The price of seats will be $1, $2 and $3.
A number cf the most prominent
wealthy men in the City are interesting
themselves in the project. Among them
are Henry tcott, E. W. Hopkins, Joseph
D. Grant, Mayor James D. Pbelan, Henry
S. Crocker, William M. Newhall and
others, including persons prominent in
the local French colony.
This preliminary meeting was held at 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon. They at
once decided personally and with the
assistance of several other men to offer a
guarantee of $40,000 to the French Opera
Company now in New Orleans.
That company has between 125 and 130
performers.
It win cost approximately the amount
of the guarantee fund for the twenty
operas and the railroad and other ex
penses of tbe company.
The proposition was first submitted to
At Hayman, the theatrical manager, but
the project was deemed too expensive as a
pure business venture.
The guarantors do not, of course, seek
to profit personally lrom the undertaking.
They hope that it may be sutliciemlr suc
cessful to render the use of the guarantee
fund or any part of it unnecessary. At
the reasonable prices decided upon it will
be necessary to play to full houses. The
California Theater accommodates about
1500 persons.
On an average $2)00 will have to be
taken in each nigot in order to raise
$40,000 for the twenty operas.
Arrangements have already been made
with Ai Bouvier to present tne operas ai
the California.
The French opera company now in New
Orleans is, according to the critics, tbe
best that has been heard there iv the last
twenty years.
It is cuitomory with New Orleans, com
paratively isolated as it is and having
many residents of French descent, to have
some large Parisian opera company come
over each year for a season of grand opera. |
It is hoped that the experiment here
may result in the creation of a popular
taste that wiil become a demand fu# such
music
The company that is billed to come
here Is completely equipped. All the
operas will be sung in French, and in
French alone.
Some of the singers of the laree com
pany are: Mme. Berthet, Mme. Fre
mieau-Benati, Mme. Feedere, Mme. Sa
vine, Mme. Lafeuiliade, Mme. Beliet, M.
Massaret, M. Albers, M. Prevost, M.
Atbers, M. Freich.
The company's repertoire of operas is as
follows: "La Juive," â¢â¢L'Africame." "Les
Dragons de Villars," "Sigurd," "Rigo
letto." "Le Chalet," "Faust," "Cavaileria
Rusticaua,' : "William Tell," '-Miss Hel
yett," "La Filledu Regiment," "La Navar
raise," "Carmen," "II Trovatore," "Le?
Husuenots," "La Mascotte," ''Aida,"
"Mignon," "I Pagliacci," "Tannhauser,"
"Traviata."

IN HONOR OF
A LONG REIGN
British Will Celebrate Vic
toria's Diamond Anni-
versary.
Day of Jubilee for Sixty Years
as Ruler of tbe English
Peop'e.
The Funds Will Be Used for a Ma
ternity Ward or Hospital for
Deserving Women.
A number of British residents of San
Francisco met in tbe marble room of the
Palace Hotel yesterday to take steps look
ing to the celebration of Qjieen Victoria's <
! diamond jubilee this year.
The meeting was called to order by j
Consul Warburton and the meeting em- j
| powered him to appoint a committee to i
I make all arrangements necessary to a
! proper celebration of the fact of the
i Queen's reign of sixty years.
Several speeches were made by promi- |
| nent British residents, and all said they
i were in favor of taking such steps as ;
would redound to the credit of the lovers
Sf 'the grand old Queen."
William E. Doxey, as president of the \
I British Benevolent Association, reported
i that the Victoria Hospital Association ,
had left a fund of $7000 with the British j
Benevolent Society and the St. Andrew's
Society, half with each; that the interest i
was to be used for hospital purposes, and I
that the funds were safely intact for the
purposes prescribed.
It was the general sense of the meeting
that the diamond jubilee be celebrated in ':
some imposing manner, so that tbe fund
therefrom nii^tu exceed that celebrated at
the golden jubilee at Woodward's Garden
ten years ai:o.
For the purpose of reaching the desired
end a permanent organization was ef
fected, with the follow ine officers: Cbair-
I man. Consul Warburton ; vice-president,
F. W. Brandon; second vice-presideui,
George F. Butler; third vice-president, R.
B. Furman.
Speeches were made by the Rev. W. W.
Bolton, George F. Butler, William E.
Doxey, J. Pope and others.
Before adjournment the chairman was
authorized to appoint a committee of fifty
to take eo tire charge of tbe forthcoming
diamond jubilee. The appointment of the
committee will be completed this week.
It is the purpose of those in charge of the
affair to make it imposing in every parti
cular and to raise a large fund. It is
probable that several thousand dollars
will be raised for tbe maintenance of a
maternity ward at the California Women's
Hospital. _____________
HASKELL GETS THE AX.
Populists Turn Against Their
Late Leader With a
Vengeance.
RÂ»so utions Adopted Condemning the
Policy of the Spring Val ey
Water Company.
A warrant for the political suppression
of Burnette Ot. Haskelt, erstwhile "boss,"
was signed at a meeting of the Populist
County Committee, held last night at
915)4 Market street.
The trouble began when he secured an
office a few weeks ago immediately act
joininc the room with "People's party
headquarters, hours from 9 a. m. to 5 p. M."
on the door in the Murphy building. This
was regarded as a strategic move to se
cure legal prestige by continuity to the
headquarters of the party, and so a few
leading spirits quietly scratched the words
"People's party headquarters" off the
door, leaving only the office hours re
maining.
To complete Haskell's discomfiture it
was decided last night to remove the
headquarters to Home other building, and
J. H. Porter, W. Gofl and W. E. Walker
were appointed a committee of three to
look up new quarters and report at the
next meeting. The ostensible object of
removal was "to secure more commodious
apartments." ,
"The only other item of Interest which
occurred at the meeting was the adoption
of a drastic resolution condemning tne
ras and electric "trusts" and the Spring
Valley Water Company as "greedy cor
porations," and approving the action of
the Supervisors in examining the book* ot
the latter company.
ELECTRICAL WOBKERS.

MARVELOUS ELECTRO MACHINE
Will Bo Used by Mi** Fleiahmann for
X Kay Investigation.
The first radiograph ever made on the
Pacific Coast with astatic electro machine
"a: made last week by Miss Elizabeth
Fleishmann at her laboratory at 1017 Oak
street. The result left no doubt of the
superiority of the stalic machine over the
ordinary induction coil and storage bat
tery. The pictures obtained were all that
could be desired in every way and were
produced in less time than by the method
in general use.
The machine referred to is the first of
its kind to arrive on the Pacific Coast,
and truly it is a marvelous piece of elec
tric construction. It will give ony known
kind of current and is so easily handled
that the electric enercy can be distrib
uted anywhere, in fact it is possible to
fill a room with the subtle fluid so that
sparks of fire will come from the walls and
furniture and any metal object will be
come a blaze of light.
But it is for making X-ray investiga
tions that Miss Fleishmann will u<e the
machine. It is much less work than by
tbe old method and so much more can be
accomplished. To make the picture of a
hand it is only necessary to place it in po
sition, connect the Crookes tube and turn
a handle for a few seconds. Tha. current
is generated by causing a number of glass
plates to revolve, which create what is
commonly known as "frictional" elec
tricity. This is connected with the tube
and makes the X rays.
Miss Fieishmann has been a conscien
tious student of the X rays for several
months and has done some of the best
work in the City. She has in mind sev
eral experiments of a most interesting
nature that are likely to throw some
light od the working of the senses. The
results will be made public from time to
time, and as she has one of tbe best outfits
in the country a great deal is to be ex
pected.

BAY PIRATES AT SAUBALITO.
They Broke Into a Store on Friday and
Stole a Valuable Parrot.
Sausalito is at present suffering from
the depredations of a gang of bay pirates,
who have entered several stores during
the past few days and carried off booty
more or legs valuable.
Andrew Nic ols' oyster grotto was forci
bly entered on Friday night and sundry
liquors and cigars were stolen. Mrs.
Nichols is also deploring the lons of a pet
parrot, said to be worth at least $100.
Polly was a general favorite, and albeit
occasionally adaicted to strong language
directly attributable to nautical influ
ences, was on the whole a well-conducted
bird.
A few days before this the new post
oftice was broken into, but fortunately for
the Government there was nothing for
the thieves to steal, since the Dontoffice
material had not been removed from the
old quarters; otherwise the loss might
have been serious.
The local police visited all the ships in
the harbor yesterday, including the U. S.
S. Petrel, but could find no trace of the
robbers.

WHITE LABOR
FOR HONOLULU
on Foot to Substitute
A Plan
American Help for
Oriental.
W. N. Armstrong of Hawaii
Corresponds With Commis
sioner Fitzgera'd.
The Island Government Sail to Favor
the Settlement of American
Citizens.
Labor Commissioner E. L. Fitzsrerald
states that he has a bis scheme on foot.
It is nothing less than enlisting the co
operation of the Hawaiian Government in
the substitution of American white labor
on the islands for that of Orientals, now
generally employed there.
The inception of this scheme grew out
of a visit to thts City of Labor Commis
sioner W. N. Armstrong of Honolulu on
his ricent return from Japan ana iv.rtu
eal, where he had been sent by his Gov
ernment to study the labor question.
On his return he called upon Labor
Commissioner Fitzgerald, and in a con
versation with him learned much re
garding the advantages to be gained by
the employment of white labor as against
that of Oriental on the low standard ot
European countries.
As soon as Mr. Armstrong arrived in
his island home he made his report to his
Government and also set forth the in
formation he had obtained in his inter
view with Mr. Fitzgerald.
So forcibly did he lay the facts before
his superiors that he was requested to
consult with the managers of the sugar
plantations and obtain their views upon
the question.
This he did, and the encouragement he
received from them caused him to write
the following letter to the Labor Commis
sioner in this City:
Honolulu, H. 1., Jan. 2S, 18D7.
E. L. Fitzgerald Â£*g., tan Francitco, Cat.â MY
Dear Sir: I stud 10 you a coiiv ol the Ha
waiian Advertiser, in which there is a notice
of your report. 1 am now doing editorial
work on the paper.
There is much interest taken here in the
employment pi white labor on Hie plantations.
One of the largest is now considering the ques
tion of putting up the buildings necessary ana
so luling ;o you lor families. I have advised
the managers to Invite you down here at once,
so that you could advise intelligently on the
subject. 1 beiieve this will be done.
I informed them that you might not be able
to come at once owing the need of your pres
ence In Sacramento. The managers believe
that the arraugemeuts lor white labor should
be such that it may work separately from
either Japanese or Chinese. All this will in
volve considerable expense, but I believe it
will bo willingly made.
Few here have faith that you can furnish
reliable laborers, and they "will watch the
experiment with much interest.
The lime for makinit contracts and the time
for planting cane is after the month of May, so
there it no pressure for time. I wouid be glad
to know at what lime you could leave ana visit
us In case the invitation is sent you. Sin
cerely yours, W. H. Armstrong.
The scheme uppermost in the rrnnd ol
Mr. Fitzgerald is to supplant 30,000 Japa
nese, 15,000 Portuguese and 14.000 Chi
nese laborers on t c sugar plantations
aud substitute white American help, mak
ing suitable arrangements with the plant
ers and also with the Government for
their comfort and protection.
Under the present agreement between
the Japanese and the Hawaiian Govern
ments the sum of $112 must be paid the
former Government by the latter for
evoiy laborer landed on the islands.
The object of the present negotiations
is that this or a greater sum .should be
distributed toward bringing white Ameri
can families from California to Hawaii to
work in the sugar and coffoe plantations.
The Sandwich Island Government is
now wrestling with a problem which is so
perplexing that action upon the same is
paralyzed. The Japanese Government is
on the verge of demanding enfranchise
ment of the 30.000 Japanese now num
bered among its population, a power
which if extended the right of suffrage
would overwhelm iv strength the com
bined efforts of all other lorces. Geo
graphically situated so as to render the
immigration of this class the most con
venient ita plantations are now operated
almost exclusively by Japanese hands,
and, with no restriction upon the hordes
yet to come, the strained condition of
affairs in that republic augurs no future
well-being.
As that condition exists in the islands,
whether to relieve a state of approaching
disorder or to open a traffic in cheap
labor, advances have been made, as above
stated, to have white American citizens
take their places and drive the Orientals
back to their homes.
These facts, according to the Labor
Commissioner, clearly demonstrate the
difficulties- which are Drought about
through the importation of cheap con
tract labor witnout taking into considera
tion what kind of citizens ttiis pauper
labor will make and their ultimate in
fluence over the social conditions of the
country.
Mr. Fitzgerald says he will take atrip to
the islands as soon as be can be spared
from his office by the attention necessary
to look after oroposed lecisiative enact
ments which he now has in Sacramento.
His object in jjoing to Honolulu will be
to assure the Government ami the planters
that he can supply them with 10,000 white
laborers from this State in one year; but
different arrangements must be made for
tneir homes and accommodation from
that provided for the Japanese. He will
ask that the passage of the men and their
families be paid for either by the Govern
ment or the planters, or by both if aeree
able. He states that he will also ask that
all exb-tinp labor contracts with China,
Japan, Portugal and any and all countries
outside of the United State- be abrogated.

Next Friday Evening Oakland Will
Witness a Great Religious
Revival.
Oakland Offick San Francisco Call*
f*OS Broadway, Feb. 6. j
Evangelist Munhall will give notice from
EVANGELIST MUNHALL, Who Has Planned a Novel Religious
Parade for Next Friday N:ght.
tbe pulpit to-morrow of a scheme which
he has devised which will no doubt cause
much surprise to the pastors ftnd all the
youn^ people's societies of th;s city and
vrj.ich may even bring forth a criticism
.rom Professor Jordan.
Mr. Mun hall's idea has ben put in
practice in other large ci'.es, but lias
never been tried in Oakland. He propoees
to inaugurate a process: n next Friday
evening in which all ihe pa-tors, the
police, Christian Endeavor societies, Ep
worth leagues, Sunday-schools and Baptist
Young People's Lnion will march
â¢through the streets behind Professor
Birch, who will i lay on his golden cor
net. The progressive evangelist has also
ciared to surest that a touch of fireworks
thrown in will add to the effectiveness of
the occasion.
"It is necessary in some ca'es," said
Dr. Munhai, '-io arouse the people from
their lethargy, and this seems to be one of
the cases. There are certain elates of
peopie who wili not come into a revival of
their own free will and who need to be en
couraged. A march through the streets
with music and fireworks w.'.i in some in
stances be more effective than a printed
nonce. I hhve had a? many as 2000 peo
pifc in one of these marches and an arch
of fireworks under which they all passed.
'Such incidents call attention to the meet
ing, attract thrones of people, strengthens
the young Christian and at this time es
pecially wili help to create general inter
est in the National Christian Endeavor
Convention of '07, which will meet in San
Francisco.
. "I will guarantee that next Friday even
ing after our march bat taken place, and
possibly a few fire worts hava been shot
into the air, even ii the Fir^t Presby
terian Church were as large again as it is
we couid n:l it. I have already mentioned
this plan to tbe city offic< rs, and they are
heartily in accord with the id^a. Tbe
of i'ohce, I am a^rfcabiv surprised
t.o i::id, is a Christian Endeavorer, and
enters fervently inio all efforts to benefit
the masses."
â¢At 2 o'clock to-tnorrow afternoon a
meeting will be held at the First Presby
terian Church to arranco for this monster
âº ' a parade on next Friday evening. It
will start from the First Me"thodist Epis
copal Church, will parade down Washing
tonstreet to Seventh, along to Broadway
and up to Fourteenth, when it will go to
the church.
An effort will be made to bring in dele
gations from the youn- people's societies
ot the surrouruiing towns, and President
11. J. \\ aters of the city Christian Endea
vor Union confidently states that not less
thaulOuo vcun_ men and the v ame num
ber of young women will be seen in the
illuminated parade.

NEW COMMUNION CUP.
Still Another Invention to Be Used in
â.â *.'^, an Oakland Church.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. (>.â Still another
aeli-cleansing communion cup has been'
introducea, and to-morrow will be used
for the first time in the Eng ish Lutheran
Church. This particular cup is the inÂ»
vention of the Rev. Paul G. Klinger. It
is a cup within a cup, the inner cup reÂ»
volvinp with the stem. There is attached
to the cup a cleanser, throush which the
rim of the cup from which the communi
cants drir.k passes.
Within the cleanser is a cushion of abÂ»
Eorbent material, which presses lirmiy
against the rim. This cleansing material,
or puriiicator, can be removed and re
newed as olten as desired. After each
communicant partakes of the winÂ« the
inner cup must be turned one-fourtb
around by the hand on the stem, anu tht
part of the rim used pas^s through the
cleanser before being OMd again. The
wine is contained in a reservoir with a
glass top, and at each quarter turn of the
cup wive for one communicant (about
half a te&spoonful) passes ironi the reser
voir by mean? of an orifice at the bottom
into the cup from which the communi
cant receives it.

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
NOT INSANE, BUT ODD
Mrs. Price Has Made a
Record in Many In
terior Towns.
Her Tale o! Woe,WithVery Little
Variation, Has Been Told to
Many O.'ficials.
Though Suspected of Su:cid3l D.sires,
She Has Always Denied Any
Such Intention
Oakland Office Sab Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Feb. G. f
Mrs. Mary Price, who was arrested at
Haywards yesterday on suspicion of in
tention to end her life, has a roost peculiar
history. The woman is evidently sane,
though somewhat weak-minded, and the
history of her life, as she tells it. accounts
amply for her somewhat dwarfed intellect.
As she sat in the County Jail this after
noon and told of her adventures it was
easily seen that in some respects she has
a remarkably strong will and a capacity
to adapt herself to trying circumstances,
with an amount of philosophy not ex
pected from on* who is suspected of being
Insane.
For several weeks past the newspapers
in the vicinity of ilarysville and Redding
have contained reports of a woman who
has been doing similar things to those
which have characterized Mrs. Price in
this county, and it was proved to-day that
it is all the work of the same woman.
Last Wednesday afternoon she was in
Red Bluff and was locketi up by the Sner
iff on a report that she was going to com
mit suicide. She arrived in Red Bluff the
previous evening and put up at a hotel.
The next morning she appeared on tbe
street and her peculiar actions attracted
mucii attention. She told some one she
was going to jump into the iiver. This
was communicated to the Sheriff's office
and she was locked up. In the afternoon
she was taken before the Suparvisors and
questioned. She aaid she was traveling
around looking lor work and wanted to
go to Oakland, where she had a friend
whose name she had forgotten. She said
BtM was 24 years of age and had two chil
dren, aged 9 and 11 years, at Portland.
She said she was married when she was
13, and denied having any intention of
taking her life. She asked the board to
pay her fare to Oakland and it is pre
sumed that this was done, as she arrived
in Oakland last Thursday and yesterday
morning started out for Hay wards.
At the County Jail to-day she told ex
actly tbe came story as at Red Bluff,
Marysville and Keddinsr, and admitted
passing through those places, but said she
had met with no trouble wbi;e there. She
now says that she wants to get to Los
Aneele?, where she has a sister and two
children.
Mrs. Price is an able-looking woman
an J her sunburnt features plainly indicate
that she has traveled a good deal. "My
husband ieft me some months ago," she
said, "and I will not live with him ai;ain.
I have been employed an an actress and
can play several instruments and am
quite capable of earning a good living, but
I want to get to Los Anneles where I can
see my children. I was in Redding a few
days ago, but did not have any trouble
there. lam certainly not crazy and the
constable at Havwards had no reason at
all for bringing me here. While on my
way to that town it rained very hard and
1 was wet through and I asked some one
to help me. Tiiey reported me to the con
stable and he brought me to jail.
"I am going to leave on Monday, and
shall co to Los Angeles if anybody will
help me to do so. I have been traveling
around looking for work for several weeks,
but shall be cared lor if I get to Los
Angeles."
The woman has evidently traveled con
siderably, as she has an intimate acquain
tance with nearly every town in the
interior of the State even as far south v-
Frvsno. Reports of her doings have from
time to time apneared in Marvsville, Red
ding, Red Bluff and Grass Valley news
papers, and it is btu natural that In due
time she should have drifted into Oakl and.
About ihree weeks aÂ«ro a younj; woman
who gave the name of Mrs. Jennie Moor<
appeared in Redding and was taken into
custody by the authorities there tecause
of her queer action*.
She told a story of trouble and priva
tion and Â»aitl that she was en route from
Portland to San Francisco, where she had
two children, and if she could reach that
place she would be cared for. The people
of Kedding paid her fare to Kan Fran
cisco an I notliing more was heard of her
until last week. She then G.-ureu in an
alleged attempt to throw herself before a
train somewhere near Sacramento. Mon
day night she applied to the Afarypville
authorities for lodging and waa accommo
dated at the siation-hous'\ At this place
she said she bad two children at Portland
and was desirous of going to them.
CAMPBELL'S SIDE
He Gives His Version of the Unmtn
Episode.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 6.â ln regard to
the story of the Oamt>bell-Hansen episode
published or. the 4th iust. Robect Q.
Campbell has written to give his version
of the affair.
He states that be s mply refused to
allow the elder boy to remain under his
roof until he would make an effort to re
form. 'The second one," he continues,
"did run away the last time because he
was refused permission from me to fre
quent the training-stables at the time of
the charges that implicated Lomax. He
is now on one of the United States war
ships, but his letters seem full of regret"
Mr. Cumpbell denies that he left Mrs.
Prescot;'.-! olHce as stated and in regard to
the whole aff.nr aaya that the boy George
hud been m^ochaviug und, unknown to
Mr. Campbell, was threatened that his
conduct wouid oe reported. The boy
went to the Hitnsens wno, he says,
had promised to "tix" Campbell if he
whipped the boy. Finally, three male
members ot the liansen family visited the
Cunmbell house, and when Campbell un
derstood the situation he punished the
boy George more severely than he had
intended.
Mr. Campbell resents any interference
with his family, says he is a Scoiohruan
(of which he is proud), but wou.d fi^ht for
las adopted land, the United States, and
leaves the public to judge whether he was
not within bis rights la acting as he did.

China, and this is probably the first case
on recoid in which a native of that coun
try has been received into fellowship by
an American labor union.
For. several weeks the question of ad
mitting Mr. Sin has been under discus
sion, and at the last meeting it was de
cided to admit him to membership, lie
has beer, in this country several months,
collectinc data and making a study of or
ganized labor in the United States, with a
view io introducing the system into
China.
'"Our action will no doubt cause much
critic. Bm," said Secretary T. J. Latimer of
the union, 'but our declaration of prin
ciples requires us to recognize honest
labor, independently of co:or, creed or
country, and aftor he had applied for
membership and we had investigated his
standing, we could not consistently have
acted otherwise. Mr. Sin is studying a
great problem, and in the course of th#
next few mouths ne wi.l be heard from all
over tiiis country.
"It has long been recognized that the
highbinder system which prevails in China

than ever prevailed in the West Indies,

our hand to him. Although we do not
want Chinese in this country to enter
into competition w:th our laboring
classes, we are not so narrow-minded as to
wish to see them make no progress in
their own land.
"Mr. Sin has already sent to his coun

COINCIDES WITH
PROFESSOR JORDAN
Rev. Father Wyman's
Views on Emotional
Religion.
Is Either Spiritual Intoxication
Or Evidence of Unsound
Mind
Says That True R ligion Consists oi
Obeying the Will of G;d as Far
as Possible.
Rev. Father Wyruan of St. Mary's
Church, a man generous in his views on
t he idiosyncrasies of human nature, and
who has been a student of the Bible for
many years, coincides with Professor
Jordan, president of Stanford University,
in bia view that "a revival of religion in
which men lose their reason is a form of
drunkenness no more worthy of respect
than the kind which lies in the uutter."
"Altnoagh Professor Jordan couched
his views in lerms stronger than the occa
sion really called for. " said Father Wv
man las>t c Yen Ing, "1 believe that in the
main he is correct in his convictions.
Emotional religion, which u>ually ac
companies revivals, rests on a false
â¢'The confession of Saul, who was miracu
lously stricken blind and again restored
to sight when he accepted the religion of
Oirist, is given by Methodists a too uni
versal application. On this miracle they
have their argument that all who would
become good Christians must undergo a
change of heart, a spiritual revolution;
must be Hooded with religious salvation,
without which they never can be truly
converted.
â Tins I believe to be a false view.
Many of the best Christians never ex
perienced any religious emotions. The
essence of relicion consists of keepinc the
I'oranundmeni' and in striving 10 do the
will of God. A man who aims to avoid
sin and to obey the will of God as far as
possible has, tn my opinion, the best evi
dence of v truÂ« Christian spirit.
"Mv own exronence as a missionary in
the Catholic church has taught me that in
mir church those people who are the most
emotional ami readily and easily weep
over tneir sins are frequently not ttieones
who prove afterward the sincerity of their
repentance by their work*.
"I have met persons who seemed in
capable of receiving religious impressions,
yet who from a rational consideration o f
the f.'re*l eternal truths of gospel and a
:irm determination to avoid evil have be
come thoroughly devout Christians.
"Now regarding Professor Jordan's re
mark that religious enthusiasm is a form
of spiritual drunkenness, there are people
who under the Influence of Methodism
manifest actions that would indicate that
they were the victim * of a deranged intel
lect.
"These are the people I believe Proles
sor Jordan condemns. Ido not thins he
would condemn r^hsious sentiment â 1 do
not mean religious emotion â that is fully
controlled by sound reason."
THE NATIVE SONS' NIGHT
How They Will Observe the
Anniversary of the Opening
of Their Home.
Vocal and Instrumental Music and a
Ball in an Artistically D corated
Hall Next Thursday Night.
The Native Sons and Daughters who
are members of the local parlors, many
native sons and daughters who are not
members of the parlors, and others who
ere not native sons and daughters, are
looking forward to next Thursday, when
on the evening of that day they may have
the opportunity to enjoy a fine concert
and dance, to be given under the {aus
pices of the directors of the Hall Associa
tion in Native Sons' Hall, in celebration
of the anniversary of the brilliant event
given on the occasion of the opening of
the new building.
The committee of arrangements having
charge of the matter has for yome time
past Deen actively engaged in making
preparations, and these have all been
completed, and each individual member
feels that what he has done in the prepara
tions will tend to make this the greatest
of all social events niven by the Native
S?ons of the Golden West.
The main hall in which the concert and
dance will be given will be decorated as it
never has been decorated before. There
will be a harmony of colors that will bring
out in beautiful contrast "Old Glory," the
NEW 10-DAT.

The association was organized in April,
1893, to build a home for the parlors of the
Native Sons of the Golden West in this
City, nv.il the result of their work is the
beautiful building on Mason street, a
iuoiAiment to the perpetuity of the order.
From the very inception of the fraternity,
born in the spirit ol patriotism on the 4th
day of July, 1875, its most earnest sup
porters cherished the hope that some day
its members might be gathered beneath
their own roof-iree and that pride of own
ership might stimulate their zeal in the
work of me order, and its good influ
ences expand thence until they had be-
OOmfl a blessing to the people of our State.
At various times delegates from the differ
ent parlors met and organized, with the
objectof interestingcapital in the erection
of a hall suited to the needs of the order,
but their efforts were not crowned with
the merited success.
Undaunted by the failure of the pioneers
in this work, the present Hall Association
was organized, and, under the guidance
of a zealous and untirine board of direc
tors, the parlors of the Native Sons and
their members were quickly interested,
the necessary funds raised and the splen
did ball erected upon Mason street. Feb
ruary 22, 1886, aside from its patriotic
associations as the anniversary of Wash
ington's natal day, is fraucht with un
usual pride to the members of the Hali
Association, in that it witnessed the lay
ing of the cornerstone of their magniti
cent building. On February it, l*i*>, the
labors ot the mechanics and artisans were
finally hnished, and, with imposing and
beautiful ceremonies, the hall was dedi
cated to the patriotic and charitable ob
jects of the order.
The history of the association since
then has been one of marked success.
Within tho beautiful iodgerooms of me
building aie brought together seventeen
parlors of the Native Sons, h've of the
parlors of the Native daughters and many
of the other leading fraternal societies of
the City.

BLOOD BUBBLED
WITH LAVA HEAT
Police Judges Campbell and
Low Nearly Came
to Blows.
Then Ben Napthaly and Clar
ence Gray Had an Angry
Controversy.
The Second Event Followed as tin
Result cf the First and It Wa*
Equally Ardent.
A scene occurred in the Larkln-strÂ«nl
corridor of the City Halt yctteffay iimi
caused a ripple of excitement MMMf ' bOM
who witnessed it, as it was expooicd thai
any moment two of the dispei^orn Ol j>>->
tice in the Police Courts would tOBM to
blows.
Judge Campbell and Judge low tmva
not been oa friendly terms for a lung tlmo
and the bad feeling between llicui luis
been intensified within tho pttst two Of
three days by Judge Low nfttstog to
recognize a bond accepted by Judge Camp*
bell in the case of Thomas Kackie (Â»lini
Costigan) and Frank Smith, charged with
grand larceny, and by an article that ap
peared in the Cnroniclo yesterday morn
ing in connection with John Drachbar
(alias Frank Bonner), which redacted
upon Judge Campbell.
When the two Judges met in the cor
ridor after their courts had adjourned
yesterday, Judge Campbell chargeu Judgu
Low with instigating the article in the
Cnronicle, and Judge Low retorted by
telling him to mind his own business and
not to interfere with cases in his court.
The controversy became warm, and At
torney Ben Napthaly added fuel to the
flames by making a personal remark about
Judge Low. Finally the two angry jurists
parted and no blood was shed.
An aftermath of the quarrel happened in
Judge Joacuimsen's court. Attorney Clar
ence Gray rose to a question of privilege
and told Judge Joacbimsen that Napthaly
bad grossly insuited Judge Low and as
Napthaiy was not an officer of the court
he should not be permitted to plead in
the court.
Jubt then a case in which Napthaiy was
attorney for the defendant was called.
Napthaiy came into court and the Judge
told him he could not practice in the
court.
Napthaiy was indignant. He denied
that be was not an otticer and said that
h.s attorneys, Judges Maguire and Car
roll Cook, had advised mm that his dis
barment by the Superior Coart was illegal
and would be set aside by the Supreme
Court.
Clarence Gray said he could prove his
assertion and would submit an affidavit
showing by the records that he was right.
Napthaiy turned his wrath upon Gray
and there was a scene of the wildest ex
citement. "Murderer" and "liar" were the
words mat were bandied between the two
angry attorneys and finally the Judge or
dered Sergeant Duncan to place the two
attorneys under arrest. Then there was
quietness and me Judge ordered Nartha y
to leave the court, telling Sergeant Dunf
can to arrest him if he appeared asa:n. .
Napthaly left the court mmterinc to
himseii, but when he got to the door he
turned round and hurled a parting *hot at
Gray. Then Gray, with uplifted can*,
made a rush for the door, followed by the
sergeant, but Napthaly nÂ«ul disappeared'

â¢loves, and the season of his leisure often
being a period equal to that of his duty,
it occurs that he withdraws himself

to drive him; it ceases to be his incident
occupation in life, but is nis primary one.
Though he never ext>ose9 his estimation
oJ the business, yet in his inner feelings
his profession of arms has dwarfed into
insignificance and the real thing in life is
the hobby, risen to enwrap the man, to
make him an expression of it, not as an
embodiment of militarism as he was
started in his life path to become.
Thus it occurs that under the blue coat
and the epaulettes walks the actor or the
artist. To the world they are lieutenant
this and captain that; but to nature and
their own their own deep selves one is an
expressionist of dramatic force, the other
mirrors his surroundings with the brush
and canvas.
Of course it can be accounted that where
a man comes to be great in some line
which is in a manner incident to the
business of war that he is pushing some
thing definitely within the scope of his
profession. The zone of industry em
braced by the material needs of the army
i* so wide that studies which a tew years
ago would have been regarded as dilettant
ism and properly categoried as hobbies
are now within the recognized sphere of
military practice. Indeed, there are occu
pations which primarily were actually in
dulced as hobbies, which the expanding
embrace of the military profession has !
<=ince inclosed and they stand to-day as :
regular departments of the service.
When Lieutenant G. O. Squi6r, Third
Artillery, began delving into electricity he
did not perceive that such would in a
short while be an apnropriate arm of
military mechanics; but such soon came
to pass, and when he invented a device
for measuring high velocities of projec
tiles, both inside and outside the guns, by
means of polarized light he was recognized
as more of an inventor than a soldier. It
j was through Captain John Miilis of the
j Engineer Corps diverting his off moments
with electrical machines that he came to
conceive the idea of lighting the Bartholdi
statue in the New YorK harbor, and it was
through his penchant for delving into the
conduct of the mysterious physical fluid
that he wa* put on the Lighthouse Board,
where he still is.
Captain J. M. Ingalls is a great genius
in mathematics; the mobility of his brain
fibers fairly weeps with figures, like dollar
marks in the dreams of a pawnbroker.
His delight used to be to figure out the
transit of Venus and to indulge in long
and involved correspondence with noted
professors of mathematics over intricate
problems in that science. Under the sol
dier's cloak of the man stalked the
Archimedes, no more fitted by nature to
be a military shooter and siabber than
was the ancient Syracusan. But a con
genial place was found for him at Fortress
Monroe as instructor of ballistics, tbroueh
which he can lock beads with his students
in calculating the degrees of tie arc made
by the howitzer bomb when discharged at
a certain angle, impelled by the burning
of so many grains of powder.

FIELD FARINGS IN FEBRUARY
Tke Naturalist at Large Muses or\ tke JMystery of the Blessed
Seedtime Season
T.yT.vNTIL this year I had always sup
-1 Â«^l& posed thai the butterflies were
|LLJ;^ creatures of a single season, livine
their brief, happy summer and pass-ing
away with the- falling leaves before the
autumn rains. I find tbat in California,
at least, this is not the case. Our butter
flies, or at any rate some varieties of them,
seem to spend the rainy season in a sort
of torpor, perched with folded wines, in
safe crannies, out of reach of wind and
storm, waiting till the clouds roll by and
brighter days come. One such patient
waiter I have noted daily for three months
past in a corner behind a door, and I am
sure he has not stirred during all these
weeks. He will wave a languid wing or
move a foot if molested, but these are
all the signs of life he gives. Another
has been spending the winter juÂ«t inside
the edge of a yellow-hammer's abandoned
hole, and one rested lor* a matter of two
months or more on my window ledge, but
flew away one sunny day recently, and
to-day a handsome gold and brown fellow
took flight from under tne eaves of the
shed roof and fluttered away to where the
wild currant is blossoming yonder by tne
stream.
This probably explains the presence of
butterflies In the winter fields. They are
not new-comers, but old inhabitants, sun-
ning themselves on warm noondays. I
have counted a dozen within the last
hour fluttering about among the mustard
and cress. A little spring salad does not
come amiss with them any more than it
does with us.
It is surprising, the number of insects
to be noticed about during the winter
months. A goldfinch has been traveling
up and down the trunk of yonder big tree
for the last fifteen minutes searching the
crevices for something which he evidently
finds, if one may judge from his frequent
jittle pecks and darts at the rough bark,
and a dragon-fly i& skimming about on
the surface of the pool yonder. I have
seen no ants as yet, but a big bumble-bee
just went blundering by, and the honey
bees are already improving the shining
hour among the swamp - willows. This
has been a comfortable winter for the
bees, but I lancy they are tired enough of
honey at present, and are glad to get
some fre?h bread again. They find this
in the yellow pollen of the willow catkins,
and devour it eagerly. There is not very
much of it as yet, but a fortnicht hence
the ground will be strewn with the yellow
powder, and a little later the air will be
full of the willow's winged seeds sailing
off to who knows what fair bourn? The
airy, fairy things may travel out through
the Golden Gate and reach the isles of the
South sea. Or they may never come to
port at all. It is iust because of this ex
treme hazard of fortunes that the willow
and other wind-fertilized plants produce
such myriads of seed. Millions come to
naught, but there are plenty, even after
the bees have eaten their till of yellow
bread.
The bees here by the streamside need
fresh bread for they have had a hard
winter, despite favorable conditions.
They swarmed late in the season and found
her Sunaay-night beaux with song and
music from the compositions of Major
John A. Darling of the Third Artillery,
who has recently taken a brief leave of
the Presidio to seek health in the East?
The carol of song breaks out through the
brass- bound blue and the welling soul of
the songster drowns the fierce guttural of
the man of blood.
Haric! the sepulchral tones: "I am thy
father's spirit; doomed for a certain term
to walk the night" â and thus in amateur
theatricals used Captain Butler Price to
recite the part of Hamlet's ghost while
Lester Wailack, sitting in the audience,
greeted his closing sentences with the ap
plause of a critic who knew when the
ghost was well performed. Wailack
many times urged Captain Price to take
the stage and Fanny Kemble was anxious
to star with him, but the captain steadily
refused to leave the army, and though ha
is still the actor that nature made him,
yet he never quitted tbe ranks of the
amateur.
The same remarks are applicable to
Captain Charles Humphries of Angel
Island, the magician who knows and does
all the tricks that Herrmann knew, con
cerning whom the Sunday Call had an
account in its issue of January 17. Captain
Humphries, as did Captain Price, ex
periences the fact that however great may
be an actor's merit, the world does not come
to know it so long as he remains an
amateur, and he cannot elevate his hobby
into a profession and sustain himself in
the army.
Then what has brazen cannon and the
weighty caisson, in Bhort, what has ord
nance anyway to do with poetry? Yet,
Captain W. B. Gordon, ordnance Btaff
officer at West Point, writes the most
charming verse; romantic pentameters,
iambic idyls, the poetry of love with its
soft airs breathing perfume through the
melody of words, the artist in language
expressing the sentiments or the passions
of the soul, the delights of the mind; and
outside his window the armed sentry
moves his measured pace around mounds
of cannon bails and big-bellied howitzers
yawn their wide mouths, there, if need be,
to beich out fire ana thunder.
And while Captain Gordon is writing
poetry, aud Lieutenant Wise of the Ninth
Infantry is being hauled aloft "messen
ger"-like on tbe cord of his tandem kites,
whereby he demonstrates that a combina
tion of box-kites can be flown which will
support the weight of an observer in'mid
air, and while Lieutenant-Colonel Taeo
dore A. Dodge is writing an extension to
his hi-tory of Gustavus Adolphus, the
neiehborsof Lieutenant-Colonel J. V. Mid
dleton, physician-surgeon of the Depart
ment of California, are listening to an
opus of Beetnoven which ascends from
the windows of the colonel's house. The
nimble fingers of the military physician
are dett upon the ivories of the upright,
and the staccatos, thecrescendos and pian
issimos, punctuate and swell and modu
late beneath the touch of one of the most
exquisite performers upon the coast, per
haps within the country.
But what local lover of science did not
no better abiding place than the empty
box over there. They had to build from
the ground up, so to speak, but they set
to work with a will, and when, the other
day, I pried off a side of the box and took
a peep at the contents, I found it solidly
filled with snowy, delicate sheets of comb
in which was yet scarcely any honey. It
was a fascinating sight, but a worker bee
came out to inquire my business, and I
denned it best to retire.
February is a beautiful month to be
afield in. One gets so much of the be
ginning of things. It seems to me that a
loaf of bread can never be a prosaic thing
to him who has walked the February
fields. There is such marvelous beauty in
the brown, upturned earth, with its deep
furrows where the tender green blades are
already pushing sunward. Along the
edges and iv warm corners poppies and
buttercups are smiling. Blackbirds
whistle from the fencetops and the meadow
larks sing on the ridges and in the furrows.
Possibly they pull a few blades of grain,
though they are after bugs and worms
rather than the young wheat and barley,
but they do enough good as insect-de
stroyers to pay for them, and when your
bread tastes unusually sweet and its
lightness lifts the heart, be sure it is be
cause somehow the songs of the birds got
into the growing of it, and. so ripened and
mellowed with it that the clangor and
crushing of the mill and the kneading of
the dough only served to incorporate it
still more closely in the crust and crumb
of the loaf. That thought ought to make
it the bread of thankfulness indeed.
There is more than the sweetness of
song in your loaf of bread. The blue sky,
the brown earth, the tender rain, the
whispering south wind, the honest human
toil that brought it to perfection have all
gone into it to make it "bread, which
strengthened man's life and is therefore
called the staff of life." They are more
than bread â they are words that proceed
from the Father of all, by which, and not
by bread alone, man liveth.
But February brings other beauties than
those of the open field. Just over the
brow of the hill, where the brown upland
meets the skyline, the land dips suddenly
Into a deep canyon. Half a dozen paces
away from the sunny field and we are
walking in the semi-darkness of the red
wood and laurel shades. The wild straw
berry is in blossom along the edge of the
wood, and the huckleberry bushes are tip
ping out in the exquisite pink and saffron
and rosecoior of their new growth. The
madrono trees are budding and the twisted
manzanitas are a mass of bloom. The
edge of the woods is the place of all others
to find the wild creatures of nature.
Within the canyon the air is chill, and
herbage, seeds and insects are scarce, so
the quail and rabbits and small birds flit
and creep about the open, ready to seek
covert at the approach of danger.
Half a dozen ground robins are scratch
ing about in the open. No Central Cali
fornian landscape would be complete
without this plain, little, brown bird some
where in view. He is a silent creature the
greater part or the year, with only a single
feel a loss as of the passing of a brother
when Captain Anthony Wayne Vogdes,
long stationed at Fort Mason, a few weeks
ago folded his tent and silently moved
away to take a position at some Eastern
rendezvous In obedience to some relent
less order which took no account of tbe
welfare of California science' The captain
is a geologist and a bibliophile; and pro
ducts of his learned labors in a volume of
bibliography of paleozoic Crustacea now
ornament the shelves of the California
Academy of Sciences.
The specialty in geology of the captain,
however, was the trilobite. the earliest
form of invertebrates which appears in
the silurian rocks. The captain made a
profound study of this crab, and great was
his joy upon occasion at finding that his
loved California had given up a most per
fect specimen of this fossil. It was found
(by the captain, I think) in one of the in
terior counties and was of all his collec
tion the most rare and valuable. The
erudite papers which the captain wrote
upon this trilobite and others of the
species are among the most important
contributions of which the academy can
boast in its department of paleontology.
By Captain Vogdes books were held in
something of the same esteem as are
penis by the lapidary. His library was
scientific and in its lines exhaustive. He
had the most important collection of
United States scientific reports known to
exist outside the Government library, and
his tireless prowl over the interiors of
every second-hand book store in San
Francisco had made him thoroughly

made to its literary advancement.
cry â "towh cc" â from which he gets his
name, "brown towhee," but very early in
the season the male bird has a short,
rather feeble, but sweet song with which
he wooes his lady. But the towhee, for all
bis plain garb, is a lovable bird and a
thorough-gome little gentleman, which is
more than can be always said of his more
popular cousin, the robin of song and
story. It is pleasant to note the courteous
manners of the ground robin in a mixed
company of birds. He is polite even to
the English sparrow, and I have seen him
make way for a young one of that tribe
where all have been scratching among the
loose hay about a barndoor.
He ia an engaging little head of the
house during nesting time, too, and grows
quite thin and careworn attending to the
wants of the family. The pair set up
housekeeping early in the year, usually in
the low bushes, lupin, southernwood,
greasewood and manzanita that cover
these hills, and raise two, sometimes three
broods during the summer. The ground
robin is a cheerful chap, despite his sober
dress, and no weather seems too wet or
too windy for him to venture forth. On days
when all the other birds sit disconsolately
huddled under leafy shelter, the towhees
may be seen, happy as larks, cheerily
flitting about, stopping now and then to
give their brown feathers a shake.
The American robin (Merula migratoria)
is unusually numerous hereabouts this
spring. They always sing during the
rainy weather, and tho air has been melo
dious with their notes during the past
week. The foj:s, too, have begun their
annual epithalamium â a not unpleasant
sound at a little distance, and I heard a
house wren singing yesterday, though I
could not get sight of the little fellow.
Across the furrows of the plowed field
below me a thousand spider-webs gleam,
diamond-studded by drops of moisture,
as though a jeweled canopy had been
spread for some fairy fete. It is wonder
ful how these gossamer webs withstand
the rain. The larks make sad rents in
them now as they brush through its
lacy meshes, stopping every now and
then to bring some lacemaker'B work to
an untimely end. The keen fragrance ot
the upturned ear f b, soaked in the soft,
large February rains, assails the nostrils
pleasantly. There is a hush and a mys
tery over the bare Drown fields, where
the seeds of the coming crop lie, passing
stilly from death unto life. Mother Earth
it is indeed at this time, guarding her
treasure in the brooding, nourishing
warmth of the eternal feminine.
To be afield in February is to come very
near to the heart of things, and the expe
rience is wholesome and refresbing. Our
little brown neighbors out in the Pacific
Ocean have days of the year set apart
when the whole population goes out to
see the fruit trees abloom. This is a cus
tom we would do well to imitate, but bet
ter yet for us, if we ever arrive at the full
ness of seeing that which will send us to
Mother Nature in her earliest time of

Second Lieutenant Nolan, First Infantry,
now at the Presidio, had a long record as
a football player at West Point, and in
the game which was played here recently
with the Olympics he surprised the na

always ready for a round with any man
of his class, of which, unfortunately or
otherwise, there are very lew. It has

A NINETEEN CENTURY PAINTER WHO RANKS WITH THE OLD MASTERS
CIBLO opeak disparagingly of modern
art is tbe sit-n of the mpst superior
jlj^ intelligence; to sigh and snake the
head and murmur that the race of giants
is extinct is to bring proof positive that
Philis.inism may not claim you for its
own. This peint of view has distinct ad
vantages. 1' permits of no argument and
limits the expectations. The unruly
genius may start in u\ on his career with
discreet dreams of painting as nearly like
or as much unlike Velasquez, or Monet,
or Vandyke, or Titian, or Manet as pos
sible if only be impress into his work "the
modern spirit." Heaven knows what that
spirit may be, but the genius of to-day
must not hope for popularity without it.
There are Dutch master-, a few centuries
behind us, who painted little light spark
ling landscapes that were as vividly real
istic as tho-e of the aiost ardent impres
sionist of the day; and there are some
Pompeiian wall decorations that might
have been signed by Puvis de Chavannes
â gray, flat surfaces, wim delicate figures
in pale harmonies of color. Were they to
be exhibited to-day, with their touches of
archaic drawing, connoisseurs would shed
tears of joy and tbe tiresome word "mod
ernity" would figure :n every criticism.
Mr. Watts is not modern. It takes
courage to confess it, and still more, to add
that it is a great relief that he is not. It
is rather a vague statement to make, after
a confession of ignorance as to what is
meant by the te rm, but it is the one thing
to be sure of, Watts is no more modern
than Homer.
To collect the works of ono artist is to
submit them to a crucial test âeither his
pictures are immeasurably improved by
the contact with each other or they be

SCIENGE WILL NOW WATCH FOR EARTHQUAKES ALL OVER THE WORLD
|Â£S|<ROFESSOR JOHN MILNE, the
â J"r V eminent seismologist, has set afoot
A[^^ a project to establish earthquake
stations all over the world. Here is the
hrst news ot this important movement.
Professor Milne has for years been the
greatest earthquake authority in the
world. He has devoted- his life to the
study of them, and wherever earthquakes
are common his name is known. He can
tell you when the earth is quaking in
Peru and predicts the occurrences of them
in the Orient sometimes days ahead. He
has invented machines which show ju*t
how the earth moves at such times and
the effect on every variety of structures.
Scientific results of great moment are
expected of Professor Milne's plan when
it becomes operative. Commercially it is
of the greatest importance. For the first
time, it now seems probable, â¢will accurate,
reliable and valuable observations ol
seismic shocks, pulsations and earth
tiliinss be properly recorded. They will
also be preserved and so promptly trans
mitted from the scenes of tne seismic
manifestations that the news may serve
eisewnere as a waruipg of possible im
pending danger. Such news thus
promtly furnished will also greatly en
hance the value of relief measures for
earthquake sufferers.
Professor Milne is the most distin
guished of modern scientists who have de
voted much time to the study of earth
quakes and their apparent causes. His
book, "Earthquake^," is accepted as an
authority. While much literature is ex
tant, extending back to the ancients,
which contains a vast amount of inci
dental earthquake lore, Professor Milne
has lightly waved aside some of the fanci
ful theories of the speculators. Recogniz
ing the value of hard facts properly gath
ered, he seeks to have the Civilized Gov
ernments, commercial interests aud scien
tists combine in securing data which
cannot fail to prove of inestimable benefit.
Professor Milne has especially studied
seismology in Japan, and more light in
recent yea r s has probably been tnrown
upon earthquakes from -tuat volcanic and
progressive land of a new civilization
than from any one or several other sources.
The maritime interests are naturally as
much concerned and interested in this
scientific project of the scientist aa any
other. The merchant marine and even the
navies ol the world hare Buffered from the
tidal waves which have been sequences of
earthquakes or at least connected with
their causes in the minds of thinking
men. Civilized Qovernments expend enor
mous sums charting tne currents, reefs
and obstruction to clear navigation in
their ocean and inland waters, and gener
ously provide /or astronomcal and met
eorological observations and records. The
aggregate cost required for Professor
Milne's entire plan is so infinitely small
compared with that sum which is ex
pended by private enterprises on astron
omy alone that there is small doubt that
his hopes will speedily be fully realized.
The modern necromancer of science,
electricity, will play a strong secondary
part in this scheme to keep a constant
survey of the earth's surface for signs of
approaching sbocfcs. In his argument for
the adoption of his plan Professor Milne
includes the interesting element of en
abling newspapers to be assured of the
veracity oi news of earthquakes as far
away perhaps as in the antipodes.
On July 6 and September 8, 1896, ac
counts of eari hquakes in Kobe were pub
lished in the London newspapers. These
earthquakes originated in Japan, but were
recorded sixteen minutes later in tne Isle
of Wight Ii waa proved in one of these
records that there hau been an error in
telogiaphic transmission to the news
papers of two days. Another record ga7e
an accurate account of the catastrophe,
the details of which were not Known until
the arrival of correspondence in the mails
three weeks later.

experiments outside of his own fields of

has not specifically stated. It is
probable that the United States will
embrace within iis boun aries at
least half a dozen. Likely points
are "Washington, JÂ». C.J New York City,
St. Louis, Wo.; New Orleans, Ln. ; <Ja

Gradually we lose the first impression of
monotony, the portraits hav j as much
similarity, one to the other, as living beings
have, neither more nor less. They are not
all equally agreeable in color, but they ail
have that vital quality in a portrait â cnar

ter minds of the century, the poets, the
historians, the statesmen ! Alfred Ten

so on through a long list of famous

His sketch for a portrait is drawn with
black and yellow ocher and a dirty white
that is almost dry. Then he models with
his dry color, so that it looks as though
he had put it on with a trowel and a rake,
and finally come the thin colors, vermil
lions and light reds and even burnt sienna
and glazes of greens and blues.
He has had exceptional opportunities.
An artist, who, from his earliest youth,
baa Jived only for his art; vrhohas been
free to live for it, without considerations
for the opinions, prejnd ces of his time,
without the terrible compelling necessity
of using his talent as a means to an end,
no wonder his work bears no sign of
struggle or haste! The brutal god man
mon which he depicts with such frightful
reality has only for him the terrors of
the imagination. Born in LonÂ«ion in
1818, ne began his career nt the Royal
Academy, but soon left it, dissatisfied, to
pass his days in the British Museum
among the rreat sculptures from the
Parthenon. It is curious that with the
preponderating influence of the Elgin
marbles his firat pictures should nave
been painted very delicately, with anx
ioui> and almost painful finish. In 1843
he competed for the prize for a decora
tion for the houses of Parliament, and,
winning it, he departed at once for Italy.
It was but a step from Phidias to the
great Venetians.
There are sketches in the studio at Lit
tle Holland House that might have been
signed by Tintoretto, so animated is the
movement of the figures, to rich and vivid
the color.
In the sketches we feel the painter,
carried away with the actual surface
beauty of the pigments as they mingle
and separate and tremble and shine on
his brush. In the large pictures the idea
is the central point, and to express it most

hankered alter a*eiÂ«moeraph and respect
fully snd earnestly endeavored to pet the
department at Washington to endow his
elaborate scientific plant with this inter
esting s-ei^momptric addition. The nieh
officials at Wa>hiiigton coidly responded
thai New Yorkers did not hnve earth
quakes enough to bother with and indif
ferently declined to provide him and them
with the coveted seismograph.
As an observer of meteorological phases
and phenomena Mr. Dunn appreciates the
va ue which observatories of seismic dis
turbances would have for the student or
the savant like Professor Alilne, who is
trying to evoive every possible fact as a
factor in the construction of a science
which will eventually make seismology
rank hich. To ours as to Great Britain's
merchant marine accurate news and in
formation of seismic disturbances wo Id
he highly valued and appreciated. Mr.
Dunn says he fully concurs with Professor
simply and with tbe utmost force he le
nores everything that may attract tbe at
tention. In the picture of Hope seated on
tbe ball of vapor that represents the
world, a little shining figure in blue, with
'a brilliant little head that seems to absorb
the light, we have beautifu. painting, so
as to show that if he does not always use
this instrument it is not because he can
not.
In that eventful trip to Italy, especially
in that city of dreams, Venice, he gradu
ally arrived at the conclusions in regard
to his work from which be has never de
parted. At 25 be made colossal plans for
his future, and at 75 be is still steadily
engaged in fulfilling them, with unim
paired freshness and enthusiasm and a
vigor that a youth might envy. He
wished to make a series of frescoes repre
senting the history of the world, and his
smallest pictures have always preserved
the decorative quality. Unconsciously
Milne in his recognition of the importance
of anticipating, confirming and correcting
such telegraphic news.
The records of the Weather Bureau of
this city bear few traces ot any disturb-
ance properly charjieabie to seismic origin,
and then mostly reter to unimportant
manifestations, exceptins the real shock
of about ten years ago which affected the
Atlantic coast and extended its fury on
tne devoted southern city of Charleston,
S. C. If the New York Weatt.er Bureau
bad been equipped with the proper seis
mologic ouilit its memoranda of puny
earthquakes might have been more num
erous. Thee considered with the records
made at other points might have con
tributed totne final solution of the old
question: "What makes the earthquake?"

The sketches for me pictures "Chaos."
-The Creation," "The Temptation,"
"The Death of Abel" are conceived in tne
Italian spirit. The well-known and most
beautiful compositions, "Orphans" and
"Eurydice," are far finer in the small than
in the larger canvas, where botn figures
are lifesize; and who has not been im-
pressed with the productions of the
majestic "Love and Death" or the "Love
and Life," which an insane committee at
Washington refused to accept as a giftl
Watts has never sold a picture â he has
rarely painted a portrait to order. His
life, as an artist, has been almost unique
in its dependence, its calm and lofty re
serve. His marriage with Ellen Terry
lasted but a few years; he was unwilling
to sacrifice his quiet and retired mode of
living to the whirl of social engagements
pense of erecting new structuies for ob
servations. This is not regarded as neces
sary. At most or all of the important
points w ere observatories are desirable,
observatories equipped and manned al
ready exist, and all that is requisite is to
install sei-mographs and to instruct the
observers in their proper use.
It is intended that the records thus
made shall be given the widest publicity
and shall be made accessible to all in
quirers. Besides beine of more practical
use, they Lelp to educate the students of
physics and also interest and enlighten
the merely curious.
With a slight smile Mr. Dunn remarked
apropos of one important phase of earth
quake observation: "When we get our
seismograph. I suppose on Sundays, Mon
days, holidays and other days when news
items are scarce, the city editor will as
sign a man to come and see if the teismo
graph bas not recorded an earth tremor.
It is not improbable that we will have
such records oftener than might be sup
posed, because various causes occasionally
sufficiently disturb the seemingly solid
surface of this land we live in to make a
record on an instrument so delicately ad
justed as a seismograph."
Local causes often account for move
ments of the eartu palpable enough to
startle people and terrify the ignorant and
superstitious. Explosions, landslides and
other sudden concussions mizht slightly
affect a seismograph. In 1606 there was a
landslide at Ros>berg, Switzerland, which
occasioned a local quaking of the ground.
Volger Mohr and other writers on seis
mology have suggested that some of the
small earthquakes which have been felt
in Germany might be traced to the caving
in of the roofs of enormous subterranean
cavities gradually hollowed out by the
solvent action of water on deposits of rock
salt, gypsum and limestone.
The installation of a seismograph wonld
doubtless, on general principles, be as
welcome to other observers as it would to
Mr. Dunn. The definite purpose of Pro
fessor Milne now is, however, to deter
mine the velocity with which motion is
communicated from an origin through
our earth to its antipodes and to other
points upon its surface. From such de
terminations of speed, which are appar
enttv higher than we should get were our
world a ball of steel or glass, new light
would also be thrown upon Its effective
rigidity, a factor of importance in many
investigations.
The Trans-Oceanic and several subma
rine cable companies will nave a very
practical reason to be interested in the
work of the new earthquake survey. Sub
marine disturbances have often resulted
in the disarrangement, breaking and even
virtual destruction of cables. It is confi
dently asserted that the survey would
localize the origin of the disturbances,
while at the same time light would be
thrown upon changes whicn are continu
ously in operation upon the steeper slopes
of ocean beds.
The seismometers, with their recording
apparatus to be used in the big earthquake
survey, will have all the latest improve
ments. These instruments will no c all
the other movements bes.des great sud
den displacements which recent observa
tions have shown aie characteristic of
earthquakes. The movemems classed as
earthquakes re?embie real earthquakes in
the rai.idity with which they occur, but
differ from earthquakes in being imper
ceptible until de.ected by instrumental
means.
Another class of movements designated
as "earih tiltings" are manifested by a
slow bending and unbend ng of the sur
face. Measurements of these movements
therefore difier. The thing measured in
which had become virtually a necessity,^
and they separated by mutual consent.
Like the old masters, there is hardly a
branch of art in which Watts has not
conquered a position for himself. His
bust of Cly tie is as fine and vigorous as
hÂ»s paintings; his landscapes have un
usual interest and originality. In tha
landscape, "Tne First Day After the Del
uge, there is a Turner-like effect of sea
and mist, with clouds t at are blown away
from the great ball of fire that floods the
picture with liquid gold.
His way of working i s one not easily
described. The drawing done after many
attempts the color sketch comes nextâ a
small canvas that actually paloitates with
energetic strokes of the loaded brush
Then a larger sketch that for comoleteness
leaves very little to be desired, ana then
at last the colossal decorations, which
may be worked over for years. There is
one in which each sketch grows more im
pressive, and the largest is a decoration
that holds you with an intensity of inter
est that is almost poignant. It is called
"The Rider on the White Horse." The
catalogue gives the lines from Revelation,
"And I saw, and behold a white horse,
and he that sat on him had a bow and a
crown was given unto him, and he went
forth conqueriug and to conquer." That
noble knignt might be the young Prince
Buddha tiding out from his white castle
gate, and with all the sin and hunger and
misery of the world breaking in upon his
vision; around the white steed are clutch
ing hands and heads with straining eyes
and a terrible fear is upon them, and the
face of the knight is pale with grief and
infinite pity.
The art of the Italians was a sensuous
art; nothing of the eayety of it has been
carried into the work of their nineteenth
centuiy disciple. Mr. Watts' art is in
tellectual. He is a philosopher, a poet and
a dreamer, and his painting is a vehicle
for his ideas, of which he has enough and
to spare for a whole generation ot youth
ful artists, who shrug their shoulders and
speak of the "province of literature." To
use Mr. Watts' own words, "The great
majority of these works must be regarded
rather as hieroglyphs than anything else;
certainly not as more than symbols, which
all art was in the beginning."
In this nineteenth century, so soon
drawing to a close, there are few more dis
tinguished figures than that of this tire
less enthusiast, working for the sake of
the labor itself, who "went forth con
quering and to conquer."

Excellent results have recently been ob
tained by the Use of electricity for bleach*
ing paper.
ordinary earthquakes and earth tremors is
the displacement of a point in the earth's
crust. In the application of measuring
instrumeats to slow "tilting" the thing
measured is any change in the plane of
the earth's surface relatively to the ver
tical.
It is probable, therefore, that Professor
Milne's plan includes the use of two seis
mographs. The one following what is
termed the inertia method will be an im
proved duplex pendulum seismograph.
This instrument draws a horizontal plan
of the path pursued during an earthquake
by a point of the earth's surface. It, how
ever, takes no note of the displacement of
time, an element that must be considered
in estimating the violence of an earth
quake from the record.
In order to ascertain the elapsed time of
the passing of the earthquake the whole
movement is resolved into rectilinear com
ponents and these are separately recorded
on a continuously moving plate drum.
The point of the indicator draws an undu
lating line, from which the number, suc
cession, amplitude, velocity and accelera
tion of the component movements can be
deduced and the resultant motion deter
mined. Of this class of instruments is
this horizontal pendulum seismograph
which has been used to record Japanese
earthquakes for the past sixteen years.
To measure earth tremors an instrument
still more complicated and delicate than
those briefly referred to is desirable. Sev
eral bearing such names as "micro
seismoscope" or "microseismometer" have
been invented. Tue desideratum in this
line of scientific invention has been to find
a mode of suspension which is at once
astatic, or superior to the influence of the
earth's magnetism, and as nearly friction
less as is possible. The crossed-line sus
pension device as readily realizes this as
anything that has been devised up to date.
This microseismometer consists of two
bobs separately suspended at right angles
to each other, one above the other, in a
cast-iron case. To the top of the case is
fixed a microscope. Its micromometer
eyepiece is focused on a hair stretched
transversely across a vertical tube in the
upper bob. This measures horizontal
motion in the plane of the drawing^
Motion at right angles to this is shown by*
the lower bob, which carries a similar
transverse hair. A lens which is fixed
between the bobs reveals an image of the
lower hair in the plane of the upper hair,
so that both appear crossed in the micro
scope. Both components of horizontal
motion can thus be observed together.
It is in Professor Milne's scheme to
have a central earthquake station in Eng
land. It may be either located on the Isle
of Wight or at Greenwich. This central
station would have instruments to record
not only the slower pulsatory motions of
the ground, but also to register toe more
rapid vibrations. To obtain a complete
record of some earthquakes a minor record
Is required of the premonitory symptoms
culminating in its birth, tne magnitude
and frequency of the vibrations constitut
ing its lite, and the spasmodic tremblings
which are seauent upon the relief of the
seismic strain.
The aggregate of the sums annually
spent by civilize i nations upon the obser
vation of movements in the neavens, in
the atmosphere and upon inland and
ocean waters is enormous. While all this
labor, study and expense goes on we our
selves and the supposititiously stationary
locations of the instruments used to record
such cnan*es are frequently moved back
and forthâ in tome parts of the world
altogether for hoursâ during every year.
The people of the United States, especially
those on the lower Pacific coast region,
where earth movements are frequent, and
the inhabitants of thd Carolinas, with
whom their realistic earthquake is still a
living, sad and serious memory, will watch
with interest fur the installation of Pro
fessor Milne's system and his seismo
graphs.THE FOREMOST WOMEN'S OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THEIR LEADERS
TfiF, in the days when the water came op
1-s to Montgomery street," the mantle of
1' prophecy had fallen upon the shoul
ders of some one who had described to his
associates the San Francisco of the pres
ent time, that prophet would have been,
indeed, "without honor in his own coun
try," since no one would have believed
him.
That the growth of our City in a material
way has been phenomenal all acknowl
edge, but the facts concerning its growth
in other directions are not so well known.
It has been rather of a fad with some of
our Eastern friends, and, indeed, with
some of our own people, to speak sorne
wuat slightingly of our attainments in
artistic, literary and musical lines; but
those who are in touch with the inner life
of our best circles know tbat this is un
merited.
In no way is our City's progress more
clearly shown than by a glance at the list
of our women's clubs. There is certainly
no City in the world of B*n Francisco's
size which surpasses us in the number,
variety and efficiency of our women's or
s.anizations, since, not including the
church, religious and pureiy social so
cieties, there are over a hundred literary,
artistic, mu.-ical, patriotic, political, be
nevolent and educational associations
which have recocnized positions and do
excellent work in their several lines.
' Of the literary clubs the Century, Soro
sis. Laurel Hall and Philomath are the
largest and most widely known. The
Laurel Ha.l bear? the palra of seniority,
as it was organized eleven years ago. It
has a present membership of 100, is dis
t ncily literary in its aims and counts
among its members, past and pre.-ent,
niany of the most talented and acconi
plished of our San Francisco ladies.
Mrs. I. Lowenberg, president of the so
ciety for the past two years, has by her
gentle rule specially endeared herself to
her foLow-members, while she hrs done
much to advance their interests. Mrs.
.berg is a native ol Mobile, Ala., and
Â« a- educated at a convent at Cape Girar
neau. Comirg to San Francisco with her
parents while still a young cirl, she made
an early and vary happy marrisge and for
some time was absorbed in home and so
cial life, little time to anything
c Â»c save the charitable work in which she
has always been vitally interested, and
contributing special articles to the Ingle
side, Progress, California Magazine and
other publications.
Three years ajjo Mrs. Lowen berg founded
the Philomath, which is noted as being
one of the wealthiest, most exclusive and
most successful of our women's organiza
tions, and which expends its ample funds
most liberally in securing eminent
speakers, writers, musicians and artists to
add to the interest of those meetings
which are not devoted solely to sell
development.
Mrs. Lowenberg is a slender, dart-eyed
lady with a bright complexion and a
charming manner. Almost fragile in ap
pearance she does an immense amount of
work, as she is not only president of the
two clubs mentioned but is also one of
the managers of several charitable or
ganizations and is indefatigable in dis
charging the many duties devolving upon
her.
The Century, long known as "the"
woman's club of San Francisco, is only a
year younger tban the Laurel Kail. Mrs.
Poccbe Hearst was its first president, and
it was her generosity as well as her tact '
and general loveliness of character which
laid the firm foundation upon which the
club has buiit so wisely and so well.
A clause in the constitution forbidding
the seeming seeking of notoriety in any
way has raised somewhat of a barrier be
tween this association and the outside
world, but the privilege of membersnip
has been discriminated bestowed upon
over 200 ladies, and prosperity and har
mony have characterized each year of its
existence.
Mrs. P. B. Cornwall, who is president
this year, is a fitting representative of the
broad culture, refinement and gentle cour
tesy characteristic of its members. Mrs.
Cornwall has been in California since
c::;ldhood .and is certainly one of our
Slate's most charming adopted daughters.
Her administrative ability is exceptional,
and besides attending to her social duties,
wbich are many, and to the requirements
of her position in the Century Club, she,
as corresponding secretary of the San
Francisco Ladies' Protection and Relief
Society, attends to the entire correspond
ence of that body, which has under its
charge over ijOO children.
The Sorosis Club, organized in 1893 with
twelve members, has now 115 on its roster.
This association is built on practically the
same lines as the New York club of which
it is a namesake, and has achieved much
during its four years' existence.
Mrs. W. B. Carr is president, Mrs. Irving
Scott having retired alter two terms of
oftke. Mrs. Carr is a Massachusetts
woman born and bred, but her married
hfe has been spent in California, where
she has endeared herself 'o an exception
al y large circle of friends. She is a lady
of great executive ability and was one of
ihe organizers of the club, concerning
wnich she felt a special interest because of
the fact tnat two of her aunts are promi
nent members of the parent organization
in New York.
The Pacific Coast Women's Press Asso
ciation, now in its seventh year of exist
ence, has been exceptionally fortunate in
us presidents M rs . Nellie Blessing
hyster, widely known philanthropist,
teacher and author; Mrs. Emily Browne
Powell, one of our lew true poets and a
graceful prose writer as well; Mrs. C. P.
Stetson, famed for brilliant speech and
versatile pen. and Mrs. Ada Van Pelt
successful editor and lecturer, have each
filled that prominent and responsible
position and filled it well.
The present occupant of the chair is
Mrs. P. T. Dickinson, wifo of Colonel
Dickinson of Alameda, a lady who has
won distinction in many d.fferent lines of
literary work, and whose gracious dignity,
tine tact and charming Personality r>ar
ticularly fit her to perform the duties of

Mrs. Dickinson, better known to the
reading public by her pen-name, Hester
A. Benedict, comes from Massachusetts |
stock on the paternal side, although she
is a native of Portage County, Ohio. Her
lather, Harvey Baldwin, was an enter
prising and successful business man, and
her mother, a beautiful Kentuckian, was
among the first of American women
writers and contributed for many years to
both the religious and secular press.
Mrs. Baldwin, who has reached the age
of 83, lives in Cleveland, Ohio, and in her
happy old age can realize that she has
â¢ built for her-eif two enduring monuments,
since the Baldwin chapel and Baldwin
hospital, in Korea, were both founded by
her.
Mrs. Dickinson's first poem was a
quatrain, written at the age of 7, and
shÂ» declares that to its kindly reception

by her gifted mother she owes her subse
quent successful literary career. At 16
she "saw herself in print" for the first
time, and thenceforward contributed
poems, specials and stories to Pniladel
phia and New York papers.
In IS7I Mrs. Dickinson published
"Vesta," a volume of poems which wag
exceptionally well received, and two years
later went to New York, where she be
came a prominent member of one of the
most brilliant literary coteries of that
city. During her stay there she took a
course of dramatic training, and subse
quently gave a very r>opular series of read

{kS all that great variety of games
J habitually played with money at
_5 stake, where the element of chance
enters largely into account, there are
probably but few. if any at all, in which
there is not practiced a great deal of fraud.
The sleight-of-hand performances of those
slippery-fingered eentlemen.who have such
faculties for dealing "i at" hands are be
wildering in theextreme to those unaccus
tomed to such maneuvers, and to the un
initiated the tricks of a loaded die are as
tonishing. But the game-loving public
has been so often cautioned and the
known methods of cheating have been so
repeatedly exposed that most of those
who play to any great extent are more or
less familiar with the established coJes of
crookedness and are perpetually on the
slert to detect any attempt on their legiti
mate c.ances of gain.
There are, however, a great many in
genious contrivances for cheating at vari
ous games which differ widely from the
ordinary methods of dealing crooked cards,
and these devices, got up with mechanical
skill and known only to those who employ
their agencies, continually deceive the
public and defy detection. It would seem,
with the ruinous disadvantage to which
tbe players are subject in all percentage
games, that the most greedy "bankers"
would be satisfied to deal "square" and
there would be no desire nor necessity of
committing tbe wholesale robberies which
are so persistently perpetuated with the
aid of Yankee ingenuity.
It is to those who indulge in the "friend
ly" game of '"draw," who plunge on the
"bank" or tempt fortune on the "wheel";
it is to those who travel and accept of the
enticing hospitality of fashionable gam
bling-houses that the following description
of some devices which have been brought
to the writer's attention may prove inter
esting and instructive and of possible
pecuniary advantage to the few to whose
wisdom a word is sufficient
Probably the most popular and univer
sal game in America to-day is that of
"draw poker," and there is so much skill
required in playing it successfully that it
is usually considered more cf a game of
skill than of chance. In California, for
instance, the laws against games of chance
have been construed by the courts as hay
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1897.
in Philadelphia, was Mrs. Dickinson's
first husband, and one of the great sor
rows of her life was the loss of a lovely
little daughter born of this union. Her
marriage to Colonel Dickinson was fol
lowed, in deference to her husband's
wishes, by a long period of literary idle
ness, but latterly she has overcome his
objections and taken up her pen again.
"Fagots," her latest volume of poems, is
warmly praised even by usually severe
critics, and is meeting with a large sale.
During a year's residence in Japan Mrs.
Dickinson was s-perial correspondent for
the New York Mail and Express and the
St. Paul Daily Globe, and her keen ob
servation, quick perceptions and felicity
of expression made her letters special
ing no bearing on "draw poker," and
while such games as "faro" and "rou
lette" are generally suppressed the public
poker-rooms are run openly without inter
ference. It is in this game that crooked
cards and false deals are so often resorted
to, but it is not generally believed that
there exists any mechanical device by
which cheating can be carried on in po
ker while a correct "deck" is used and
tbe dealing is fair. Such a device does
exist, however, and its mechanism is so
perfect that it can be operated continu
ally to the tremendous advantage of those
using it, without creating the slightest
suspicion, and always leaving the 'deck"
in proper shape for the closest inspec
tion.
This ingenious device is shown in the
illustrations of this article, and consists of
an ordinary appearing poker-table, wnich
is, however, very different in consirurtion
from how an ordinary poker-table should
be. In figure 1, a represents the top of
the table, covered in the usual manner
with green cloth and neatly set in the
hollow frame. (6) Between tne top and
the frame, in front of the operator and his
confederate, are two slight openings (c)
sufficient in width to allow the passage of
a card, but not wide enough to be notice
able from the general fitting of the top
and frame. Journaled to turn in the cen
ter spindle of the table is a rod, d (see fig.
2), at the upper end of which is pivoted a
lever (c). This lever is provided near its
outer end with a spring clasp (r), which
will nicely grip and hold a card when in
serted. The lever (c) is guided by the
groove (<7) in the inner face of the frame
(see fig*. 2 and 4), so that the clasp may
be brought up just beneath either of the
openings (c). At the bottom of the rod (d)
is attached an arm (h), which is moved by
the feet of the operator, the bottom of the
table on his side being opened sufficiently
to allow nis toes to ex end beneath it
Now if the operator desires a certain card
to fill his hand and discovers, by means of
a system of signals, that his confederate
possesses the same, he first moves the arm
(A), so as to bring the clasp beneath his
own opening, (c); then by standing his
cards on edge, between his hands and
himself (as is usually done by players in
looking at their cards) he gently, with bis

dailies.
Mrs. John F. Swift is a woman who has
generously given much of herself to pub
lic life. Born and educated in New York,
she spent a numoer of years in Japan, to
which country her husband was United
States Minister, but since returning to
San Francisco she has become a leading
spirit in all movements tending to better
the condition oi women.
Bhe has been callea, most appropriately,
"a sister of women." Clear-headed, firm
and practical, she is yet sympathetic, un
selfish and warm-hearted, and wins for
herself the affection as well as the hearty
co-operation of her associates.
For three years Mrs. Swift was president
of the Woman's Exchange, of which Mrs.
John Curry is now head, and fur the past
two years was president of the Century
Club. At tin present time she is presi
dent of the State Suffrage and the
Woman's Congress associations, and fills
both positions with grace and dignity.
Her private charities are extensive, and
she is an active member of several benevo
lent societies.
Mme. Louise A. Sorbier is filling her
fifth term as president of the Woman's
Educational an^ Industrial Union, an as
sociation which helps women to help
themselves.
; Mme. Sorbier was born in Paris, but
came to this City with her parents when a
little child, and was educated here, partly
in a convent and partly by private tutors.
Meeting with reverses of fortune in 1~77
she went bravely to work to support her
self and three children and soon devel
oped into a practical and shrewd business
woman, making investments of her busi
ness profits which enabled her some years
since to retire on an assured income.
Mme. S >rbier has been an efficient officer
of the French Benevolent Society, St. Vin
cent de Paul Society, Woman's Congress
Association, State Suffrace Association
and the Constitutional Amendment Asso
ciation, and is president of the First
Equality Club of the Thirty-ninth Dis
trict.
There are three chapters of the Daugh
ters of the Revolution in San Francisco
and Mrs. Henry Wetherbee, four of whu*e
ancestors â Captain Amasa Mills, David
Merrill, Eli Lewis and Dr. Samuel Kich-
ardsâ helped fight the battles of our coun
try in those stormy days, is regent of the
original or Sequoia chapter, which was
founded in 1890.
Mrs. Wetherbee is a native of Connecti
cut and came as a bride to California to
rei^n over one of the most artistically ele
gant homes of the coast. Gif ed with un
usual musical talent and a tine soprano
voice, she has always been especially
thumbs shoves a discard, through the open
ing and into the clasp; then by moving
the arm (h) with his foot he guides the
clasp over beneath the other opening and
the discard is brought up into the hand of
his partner, who replaces it with the de
sired card ; the arm (A) is then again moved
and the clasp is brought back and the card
taken by the operator. This is all done in
much less time than it takes to tell it and
witnout any perceptible movement.
It will be seen that by the above means
each of the two confederates have the pick
of both hands and tbe cards which both
may draw, and as each is dealt live carls
at first and is entitled to a draw of five
ca-ds they should be able to collect some
remarkable hands.
Among the "banking" or percentage
game in vogue two very popular ones are
"faro" and "roulette." In both of these
games cheating is carried on very exten
sively, though "roulette" is generally
supposed to be run fair.
The "brace" game of "faro" has been
often exposed, and can usually be de
tected by carefully keeping "cases" or
tally on the cards as they are dealt. But
when your cases do not correspond with
the cards at the end of a deal it is well to
pocket your losses and say nothing, as
you will invariably get the worst of any
dispute on that score; and then, 100, you
may have made a mistake yourself in
tallying.
Crooked "faro" dealing is mostly ex
pert manipulation of the cards, which
are ahays made especially for the pur
pose, and consists in shuffling so that the
dealer retains a knowledge of the re ative
positions of some or all of them. Then by
dealing two cards instead of one tie can at
any time change the order in which they
will win or lose.
"Itoulette" is a more fascinating game
than "faro," and determines the cood or
ill fortune of the player at every whirl of
the wheel. It is a pretty sight this re
volving top, with its little ivory ball trav
eling round and round it; and in watch
ing them spin it is hard to conceive how
any ouiside influence can be brought to
bear to dictate into which of the tnirty
eignt small pockets the ball shall subside.
But sometimes the bottoms of these pock
eta are made movable, and are skillfully
prominent in the highest musical circles,
and has devoted much time and attention
to "the divine art of melcdy."
Mrs. Wetherbee was one of the organ
izers of the Ladies' Relief society of Oak
land and also of the Women's Exchange
of this City, of which society she is vice
president. Unselfish in disposition and
of an exceptionally winning and gracious
presence, Mrs. Wetherbee is truly "well
beloved" by all who know her, and her
charity is as wide as it is unostentatious.
One of the youngest of our really suc
cessful women's clubs is the Women's
Federation, which was organized a little
over two years ago, and is composed of
delegates from such of our various
women's societies as feel specially inter
attached to a system of levers i n such a
manner that when the wheel is in motion,
and until the ball subsides, any set ot lev
ers may be operated to raise the bottoms
of the corresponding pockets. This pre
vents tne ball from entering these particu
lar pockets, and it must of necessity locate
in one of the others. Also electro magnets
may be concealed beneath any of the pock
ets and a small piece of iron contained in
the ball. Then by connecting the circuit
in any convenient manner the ball may be
at once precipitated into one of these mag
netic cells.
It will be seen that rculette may be
thus run so that the player shall never
win except by the magnanimity of the
"banker," and with wheels carefully con
structed it is impossible to observe the
fraud.
An extremely ingenious device in this
line of trade was got up by an Eastern
inventor, and its most peculiar charac
teristic was that it was designed to beat
the "banker" instead of the public. It
was used in connection with some ex
pensive machines, resembling the tele
graph "ticker." These machines gave
out promiscuous quotations on wheat and
stocks, and the players could bet as they
chose â on their rise or fall. Several of
these machines were rented to different
gambling-bouses, and the inventor con
trived the following means to insure him
self against loss of rent through bad-pay
customers.
In each machine he concealed an elec
tric battery and a magnet, so arranged
that by connecting the circuit he could
cause certain known quotations to suc
ceed each other. In setting up a machine
he would connect the battery to two
tacks concealed in the carpet, and when
ever his rent became overdue he would
attach a piece of metal to the bottom of
the heel of his shoe and then go and stand
upon the tacks and play the machine
until he had won the amount of bis
rent. As he must, of necessity, have been
put to considerable trouble in collect
ing bis rent in this roundabout fashion
and money overdue is entitled to interest,
it cannot be authoritatively stated tbat
he scrupulously limited himself to taking,
the exact amount he should have other-

ested in working "for the public good."
Progressively philanthropic and educa
tional bodies are chiefly represented in
the association, and the different com
mittees into which the membership is
divided have accomplished much in their
several lines.
Mrs. Eva E. Bates is president of the
federation, a gentle-voiced, unassuming
little woman whom nothing short ot an
unmistakable "call" to help bear the
burdens and lighten the sorrows of others
could have forced into public life.
A native of Massachusetts, Mrs. Bates
was educated in Boston, where sbe lived
for some years after her marriage, sur
rounded by a congenial circle of fr.ends
and fully occupied with the pleasant
duties of her home life, her books and the
care of her little son.
Coming to this City sne lived a very
quiet and retired life until almost three
years since, when she became convinced
that there was work waiting for her out
side her own doors. iÂ«'rom that time,
although the home has never been
neglected, a portion of each day has been
devoted to the interests of the poor and
friendless.
To Mrs. Bates' New England birth and
breeding is due that spirit ol sturdy inde
pendence, modified by strict adherence to
principle, which has enabled ber to make
a success of undertakings beneath iha
burden oi which weaker natures would
faint and fail.
It is owing in a great degree to the en
thusiastic and untiring efforts of this
practical philanthropist that the Houae of
Refu.e for homeless women and children
recently established by the federation
crystal! izod from an idea to a reality.
The Port, a Club, a law club for women
founded by that brilliant, and successful
woman lawyer, Clara S. Foltz, is doing
good work under the able leadership of
Mrs. Kate F. AVillat-, who is also grand
secretary of the Order of the Eastern Star.
The absence from the City of Mrs. Foltz,
who is dean of tne society, is a matter of
regret to its members, but they are doing
her credit by their perseverance and ap
plication, and are accomplishing much in
a quiet way.

AN ORIGINAL ZOUAVE.
Ar\ Interesting Sketch of the War
Experience of Louis dames.
A variedly picturesque career has been
that of Louis James, the actor. Louis'
parents were anxious about his future,
and as in the case of all families had
formed plan 3 for his career â plans that
all miscarried, by the way. Mrs. James
wanted tim to follow the church. Her
father was Bishop of Illinois and she had
iond dreams that her stalwart son should
follow in his grandfather's steps. His
father came of a family of lawyers and
naturally wanted to see him read law.
They were counting without fate â that
meddlesome arbiter who spoils so many
well-laid plans.
While attending school in Chicago
Louis met Major Ellsworth, founder of
the famous Ellsworth Zouaves, the first
company of its Rind organized in America
and one that was to play quite an im
portant role in the events of its country.
Louis was a fine, big fellow for his age,
and clean and strong of limb. Naturally
the company captivated his imagination
and be loved to watch the drills and evo
lutions of this band of athletic ypung
men.
One day Major Ellsworth told him there
was a vacancy in the company, and in
vited him to join. Louis, who had
watched them often and was a natural
athlete, soon excelled all his companions
in the manual oi srms and those athletic
practices which distinguished the corps.
He was soon the crack drillsman and
"show" man of the company. At times
war rumors were rife, and the war spirit
blazed out. Major Ellsworth took the
company for a tour of the country, and its
magnificent work, brilliant skirmish drill
ing and general bearing was the means of
starting amateur zouave companies from
one end of the country to the other.
Their lightning execution of the most
complicated tactics evoked unfailing en
thusiasm and helped to foster the war
like spirit which had grasped the Na
tion with a gathering hand. After this
tour of the country Louis was- sent on a
visit to Binghamton, N. V., where his
father's family lived. His fame as an
Ellsworth had preceded him, and he was
welcomed by a delegation of young men,
who begged him to organize a zouave
company. The first meeting of this band
of brave young spirits was held in the
town hall, and the city was requisitioned
for arms and accouterments. The city
coulci not provide them, but petitioned
the Governor of the State for the arms.
Before the State was able to recognize
the company, Mr. James was compelled to
leave to join the Ellsworth Zouaves in
Boston, where they were to give a series
of drills and exhibitions. Then ne went
back home to Chicago. The James Zouaves
became the nucleus around which was
made up the Forty-seventh flew York In
fantry, and in recognition of his work Mr.
James was gazetted with the brevet of
major. At that time James' father had
removed to Washington, where his friend,
Lincoln, had secured him an office iti the
Department of Justice. When the Forty
seventh New York Infantry arrived there,
Louis, who had not dared tel! hi? father of
his entering the army, donned his regi
mentals and took his place at the head of
his regiment. The blow struck the elder
James with particular weight. He was
passionately fond of his son and BeriouÂ»iy
opposed to his entering the army. He
moved all the powers within reach and
secured the nullification of the commis
sion.
Louis was equally disappointed, being
resolved to serve his country on the bat
tlefield. Soon after thwarted in his de
termination to join the New York resri
ment in which he had been gazetted tie
ran away and enlisted as a private in an
artillery regiment, also from New York.
He served in this regiment in the Army of
the Tennessee, and was afterward as
signed to the quartermaster's department
of the same corps and stationed in Louis
ville, which was the recruiting headquar
ters for the army. It was here that his
love for the stage became the absorbing
dream of his life. He had tne good for
tune to meet Barney Macauley, then man*
ager of the Louisville Theater Stock Com
pany, and the young soldier was one day
accepted for small parts in tbat famous
organization, and thus began his stage
career.
His first public appearance was made in
"Mazeppa, and as he tacetiously re
marked recently it was the most L-ratclul
part he ever played, for al] he said was,
"1 thank you, my Lord."

Fisher y\mes, the Qreat Whist
Authority, on the Discard.
About four years ago Fisher Arnes, the greiU
whist authority, wrote a scries of articles to
the Brooklyn Eag'.e on the discard, alter
stating the general recognized rule to discard
from your weakest suit, bul if the adversaries
have declared superiority m the trump suif,
then ibe first discard inua: be irom your.best
protected suit; that is, tiio suit iv which you
are most likely to ba abie to take a trick. ThÂ«
first part of the rule is sound and sensible. As
a general rule one is right in holding his
longest suit so long as there is any prospect of
its establishment, and it would be unwi.> â¢ :â <
throw away from it and keep cards in a tuit in
which there is little if any chance oÂ£ tric*
tnaking. The information gives to partner is
or may be of importance; but when the adver
saries havesnown a decided superiority in
trumps and there Is very little prospect of the
establishment and br.nging in of your long
suit, it is best to throw away from it and keep
high cards in the adversaries' KUits guarded, so
as to prevent taeir establishment, if possible.
The second part of the g-neral rule, no.v
ever. is by no means of so much force or obli
gation as the first part; there are many times
â¢when it would be prudent to depart from it,
bo many iv fact as to require special attention,
even while considering the general rule.
When the adversaries have shown a superior
ity in trumps the discard from your strongest
suit if important lniorm&tion which it is
probable that they, being masters of the situa
tion, would very frequently be able to make
good use of to their own advantage and your
disadvantage. They will be directed by It
not to lead the suit up to you, or to lead it
through you, or to get rid of it in order to
trumpit, bo that the information will be more
than likely to prove to their advantage and
your injury. When you are acting on the de
fensive it is questionable whether you oueht
to tell your opponents of the suit in which
you are strongest, il such informntion is likely
to help them and not help your partner. I be
lieve that this part of the rule is subject to so
many exceptions ihat the first discard when
the adversaries have a clear superiority in
trumps should be recognized as dependent
upon the condition of the hand.
Mr. Ames winds up a two-column article
with the"c words: "I therefore think that the
rule should be that when the adversaries have
a declared superiority in trumps the discard
should be according to the hand for its best
protection."
It is evident from these considerations that
. the rule for the first discard is not of the abso
lute and hard and fast kind. It has to be taken
with a good deal of latitude and allowance for
the existing conditions. CommoQ-sencc must
be the guide in such cases.

We are sorry to have incurred the displeas
ure of any ona, particular./ men working in
the same good cause. If our labor in the
whist vineyard was not lor love only we might
feel different. It may be dollars and cents to
some "wnist editors," or it may illumine
their star(?ja little in their own estimation
to try and knock down the reputation of
'Cavendish" to build up one for themselves.
Our high opinion and admiration of "Caven
dish" is based entirely on the great good he
has done the whist world. For years he has
been called "master," long before we were
ever known or heard of in whist, and for years
to come he will be calied "master" by those
that remain in whist for the Intellectual
amusement and pleasure they derive from it,
and not for what they can make or what there
is in it. We nre so faraway from where the
sunrises and sets in this "great whist world
of our own" that we are liable to be called
"antiquated" and ".vuperannuatea," like some
oiher writers now are, because we won't do
the Highland flng act when they pall the
string. Many long years after wo are dead,
gone and forgotten, along with many other so
called "whist editors' of the present day.
Henry Jones, whom the whist world knows
as "Cavendish," will be called or known as
"master." When we reach that "his?h state of
perfection" that we, too, are obliged to put
Â«.ur hatou with a shoehorn we might attempt
to criticize the master's playing aDility. To
do so now would be presumptuous en our
part. We have played with him as partner,
against him as adversary; we hav>j analyzed
hundreds of his illustrated deals and much of
the little whist knowledge we possessâ and it
is very lmlo indeedâ we owe to him and his
writings. The name â¦â¢Cavendish" and his
good work will live on just the sÂ«me, and wii;
always have a warm spot in our heart, no
matter what others may think, say or write.
We have no doubt tne whist teachers the
above article refers to have the same good
cause for lauding his name ana whist ability
mat we have.

COMMENTS BY MR. BEIGGS.
Trick Iâ East's holding calls for a trump at
tack. West shows short trumps by not e< ho
me. North knows that South has no more
trumps, for it is not customary to play the
queen second hand from queen and one other.
E*st is not in position to see that South has no
more.
Trick 2â South makes the conventional lead.
East trumps with his filth bsst, concealing his
fourth best. North gives his partner a prob
able holding of tue king or queen and jack of
the suit that he has led.
Trick 3â Not knowing that South has no
more trumps, East picptily lontibucfi v

trump lead. Observe that he conceals thoiact
that he held six trumps.
Trick 4â North feels pretty certain that East
has the remaining trumps, but thinks it a<l
visable to mak) a lead to pick up West's
trump if he holds one. Again.it is well that
he should show his partner what he holds.
Seeing that his partner has one trump more
than North, West discards from his diamond
weakness.
Trick sâ lt can make but very little differ
ence whether North does or does not lead his
ace of trumps. North knows that the lead of
the ace and king of diamonds will leave the
command against him, for there must be at
least three diamonds in one hand. He cannot
hope to make the suit by that line of
play.* The lead of the ace of hearts is out of
the question. The lead of the single spade
will accomplish nothing, even if it finds South
with the king. In that case what would he
expect his partner to do? Return the spade
to force him, or make a forced lead of hearts
or diamonds?
The return of heart by partner would be un
desirable. The lead of the diamond would not
accomplish anything unless he leads the
queen. If he holds the queeu, North can
make sure of the suit by the lead of a
low diamond unless tnerc are more than
three diamonds in one hand. Sup
pose South does not have the queen,
but that he has the jack. The lead of a low
diamond would bring the same result if the
queen is with East, a gain of several tricks,
suppose the trick goes to the adversary. In
that case there is a possible loss, but probably
not more than one trick. The low diamond is
the lead, for it is always right to risk one trick
ior the possible gain of several when that pos
sibility is quite probable. The lead of the
fourth best is not important in this situation.
Trick 6â South must return the diamond, for
it must be clear that he can do nothing with
spHdes, for North would in all probability have
played spades if he had the king.
Trick Bâ lt must be evident that the lead of
tne trump or the diamond is immaterial.
Last must come with a heart

The president and the board of trustees of
the San Francbco Whist Club are to be com
mended on tnkine the above action. Every
one in San Francisco and every one in the
Stale that loves whist will rejoice when they
read these columns and when they know that
wfalst and playiu? for .stakes ore forever
divorced and debarred from the club that
bears the name of our City. Kvery club in the
American Whist League will more than rejoice
to hear this good news. To President George
K. Bates alone is due the credit of bringing
about this good result; his path was not
strewn with roses in accomplishing it. Ot
course, the question of losing members was
a vital one, but where one goes out of the club
for suon a reason two will come in. One year
from now the club will be proud of the step it
has taken. It certainly deserves and will re
ceive, so far as we are able to give, our warm
and hearty supnort, and we ask every lover
of whist to do likewise. Our motive in trying
to bring this same result about eighteen
mvnthsago was impugned. The spark that
we then kindled would not go out, and was
flamed into life again bythe one who was at
that time its bitterest opponent. All is well
that ends welL The letters that we published
in our whist issue of January 10 from many
of tho great whist lights of the world show
bow strong the bonds of friendship are and
how the pulsations seem to beat as a unit in
the hearts of all those that love for its own
sake the grandest intellectual amusement
ever devised by man.
To the Whist Editor c<f The Call: May I ask if It
Is customary among the Intelligent whist writers
to copy edltorl Is verbatim without giving credit

It seems to me a very easy way to conduct a

A Constant Reader and Student of The Call's

In answer to the above we will say it is a
very easy way of conducting a whist column.
A pair of scissors and pastepot cost less than
brains and the work can ba accomplished
quicker. We can hardly blame our correspond
ent for asking the above question, for the arti
cle referred to was taken bodily from The Call
without even quotation marks. We won't

earth flat after all?
Is it possible we children of a larger and
riper growth will hava to relearn our
â eography and cast from our callow brains
the old-time theories of "globe," "eastern
and western hemisphere*," "the earth re
volves on its axis once in twenty-four
hours," etc.. etc? Oh, what humiliation
we will feel when our children and grand
children indulge in that superior attitude
toward our ignorance of truth that we
have shown toward our own benighted
parents and grandparents'. Why, it won't
be a circumstance!
Evolution is the unwritten law of God's
great universe.
The piece of flint from which our dear
forefathers struck sparks to light their
fires to-day may be made almost trans
parent by the powerful strength of the
marvelous X ray. If this little reminder
of man's greatness can make us stare,
surely we should be prepared lo receive
any message the indefatigable scientists
of the world may send to us dreamers.
They may discover that we are only one
flat side of a hollow square, and that the
sun, moon, stars and ice-bound regions
form but ihe other live sides. Thousands
of years ago horses were the size of a
King Charles spaniel ; they are now grace
lul and useful monsters.
We love them for their strength and
beauty.' However, in the age of electric
car?, horseless carriages and pneumatic
tubes, the horse will in good time become
extinct or so degenerated that it will be
called some other name when our succes-
sors rule the earth. The earth may be as
flat as a griddle cake â but what has that
to do with Caliiornia?
There are a numberof Californiansfloat

They all seem very happy and contented
with their surroundings.
Adolph Roos and his fine-looking son

are still undecided regarding their return
to the coast, but will in all likelihood re

E. W. Kosenbaura of San Francisco will

There is something fascinating in a per

shrugged their shoulders when Mrs. Jack
Gardenier of Boston boldly led a young

the other day. She might have been fool
hardy, but she is the most popular of Bos

who led him about, without a muzzle over
his tawny jaws or shields on his clean
young claws.
It wouldn't be a bad idea for some San

winter, declare* he will give up the regu
lation style of execution hereafter and de
vote all of his time and energy to the new
school of what he terms "soul painting."
He has recently finished a couple of ambi
tious pictures which show poetic feeling
and combine the ideal with the pure and
simple tones nature imparts. "The Oaks"
and "Crimson Twilight" are, perhaps, the
best things Mersfelder has done in some
time. Ho has been very successful in giv
ing art lectures lately. During the month
of February he intends to give his popular
art talks at the Waldorf on the Barbazon
school of painting.
Mr. Mersfeider is in excellent health,
and is inspired with the belief that before
many years America will have its own
recognized school, the same as the French,
Italian and English. He is a native San
Franciscan.

which used to send the quick blood to the
cheeks and make the heart throb aloud
with a secret joy. After all, perhaps the

HOW IT FEELS TO BE BLOWN UP.
General Avery's Experlenc* tVhen 10,
-000 rounds of Dynamite Exploded.
"I suppose that one of the most excit
ing episodes of my lite," remarked Gene
ral Dudley Avery some time since, "was
during a thunderstorm a number of years
ago on Averys Island, when 10,000 pounds
of dynamite exploded. It was a most ex
traordinary happening, and the most re
markable thing of the affair was that I
lived to tell the tale. I was in the vicinity
of the building in which the dynamite
was stored, and when the storm came on
I took shelter under a shed which was
some distance removed from the explo
sive and which was used as a blackamitb
sbop by a man who was employed in this
capacity and who served with me during
the war and at the battle of Shiloh.
"We were chatting together when I felt a
shock, and then to my surprise I saw the
blacksmith going up in the air. I watched
him pass through tie roof of the shed
but the man, who, by the way, was an
mshman, did not seem to getanv further
jrom me. Then I realiztd that I was go
ing up, too. I suppose we must have as
cended for thirty or forty feet, and then
we came down with a rush, reaching the
earth a little disfigured and with lungs in
a state of collapse. When we caught our
breath the Irishman remarked between
his gasps that a little thing like that
couldn't scare us, as we'd both been in
explosions hefore. He was wounded
badly, however, while I escaped with a
few scratches. We found npon coming
?Â° w " that the ligntning had exploded the
10,000 pounds of dynamite. Where the
storehouse had stood was a hole in the
ground about thirty feet deep, and with a
diameter of fully sixty feet, shaped like
a funnel. Trees in the vicinity were
burned black, and an oak tree, two feet
thick, that had stood twenty feet from the
building, was blown into shreds so fine
that not a vestige could be found. I have
been afraid to go near dynamite ever
since.â New Orleans Times-Democrat."

Japanese Have About Ceased
Coming to the United
States.
'hey See Better Chances in Theii
Own Country Than in This
Republic.
The Wages of House Servants Continue
High and Thos N w Here Keep
Up Prices.
. Local observers of the Japanese question
have discovered that immigration from
Jipan has almost ceased. Whether this
laot is due to the Chinese war or to other
pauses no one has yet discovered. It is
believed, however, that the Japanese em
pire offerÃ superior inducements to its
subjects now, and that the revival of the
arts and sciences at home is highly attrac
tive to the "littie brown men" whose am
bitions in the past led them to try their
fortunes in America.
. Immigration Commissioner Stradley
has just received the annual report of the
Commissioner-General of Immigration,
It shows a great decline in the migration
of Japanese from their own country.
The report of 1895 gave rise to fears that
the Kobe Emigration Company of Japan
would succeed in iniiucing many thou
sands of Japanese to desert their own
country and come to America, but the ex
perience of the past two years has re
moved aL such fears.
The Commissioner of Immigration says
in his report for 1896:
. "The total arrivals of Japanese in this
.country dur.nÃ the fiscal year, made up of stil
at the port of San Francisco. 466 through Vic
toria, B. C, and 83 by other routes, were 1110,
a 'decrease of 40 as compared with the figures
tor -1.895. I believe that the Japanese in this
country are decreasing in number, and that
trie apprehension of a large migration from
Japan to the United States was without founda
tion, the Kobe Partnership Emigration Com
pany having failed in its purpose oi inducing
many of the Mikado's s lbjects to transfer their
residence to the United Suites.
. The result of the decrease in immigra
tion- is already felt in a general wav in
San Francisco. Two years ago the influx
of Japanese was so great that they threat
ened to run servant girls out of the City.
"Wages were low and were steadily on the
viown grade, because the young Japanese
were all ambitious to learn English and
Tvere willing ro di chores and housework
for-- heir board, or a little more, and tiie
irivL!e.:e of attending night school for an
i.o".r or so each evening. There was com
jetition among them for places, and the
tendency of wages was ever downward.
. Inquiry among various employment
agencies yesterday showed that tnu rices
of -.nese as house rvants are not
. .we.- than they were, but there is a ten
dency to a rise in wages.
The inese of this City have newspa
pers and.they are not slow in the study of
Mich social problems as pertain to their
cwn Hare and wages. >Â»ews still corves
â from Japan of a revival of indnÂ»try, and
tbe prospects are that there will be a de
crease o: Javanese immieration until eood
time- in Japan give way to an industrial
depression.
BRIGHT'S PROPERTY.
Judge Hebbard DeciftÂ«>Â« That He Has
. Â» Kight to Get It Back From
Hm isier.
Judpe H-bbard has given judgmen: for
the plaintiff in the case of Robert Briglu
against his sister, Mrs. Mary Craig. The
testimony showed that Mr. Bright deeded
his property to Mr-. Craig oecause lit be
lieved mat he was dying.
.Bright grew better" and demanded the
return of his property many times, but
. his sister refused. On April 18, 1896, a
formal demand was ruade on her and re
f sed, and tuen he comruenced suit. Mrs.
Craig showed that she had expended some
of the money for him and had paid some
tajÂ«s, but the amount wms uncertain. She
thought it was about $2000.
Judge Hebbard cited section 1149 of the
Civi. Code, which reads: "A gift in view
o; deatii is one which is made in contem
p.ation, iear or peril of death, and with
intent that it shall take effect only in case
of the aeatu of the giver."
Section 11.50 is as follows: '-A gift made
during the last illness of the uiver, or un
dÂ«r circumstances which would naturally
irapre-s him with an ext>ectation of
â  speedy death, is presumed to be a eift in
view of death."
Section 1151 provides that a gift in view
of death may be revoked by the giver any
time. 6 J
M The evidence shows," said Judpt Heb
t.ird, "that the case is within theÂ«e sec
tions, and plaintiff is therefore entitled to
a recovry of his property."

SYMPATHY FOR INDIA.

The Southern Pacific in the Role of
Samaritan in a Transporta
tion Play.
The Chamber of Commerce is jubilant
over Ihe responsive chord it struck in the
public breast when a maw- meeting was
called to aid the famine-Btricken districts
of India.
Promises of subscriptions are fairly
pouring in not only from the interior of
this State, but from all the Pacific States
as well. Sereral came from as far Kast as
Ogden, and the indications are that ere
long the matter will be widely taken nn
by all the Eastern States. p
In many cases telegrams of encourage
ment have been received. One was sent
by the Mayor of Ogden himself.
Such progress has been made that in a
short time it is expected a ship will be
chartered to convey substantial assistance
to the sufferers. Application was made to
the Southern Pacific Company by George
W. McNear as to how much transporta
tion would be given free. The matter was
duly considered, and yesterday morning
the answer was returned that the company
would transport 1000 tons of grain free to
.this City for shipment to India. The only
proviso made was that other companies
having lines in territory where Southern
| Pacific lines did not reach, would also
i agree to transport the same freight free.
1 This effectually disposes of all trouble
this side of OgJenâ¢and it is believed that
other companies will come iorward with
such proffers of aid as to entirely solve the
problem of transportation. Fully $5000, it
is estimated, will be saved by Ibis offer of
the Southern Pacific Company.

Review of Mines and
Mining in California
Tlrer L. Ford spent days last week at t
Sacramento in the interest of the mining leg
islation s'lugluby the Miners' Association. A
large number oi bills relating to mining
affairs, several being in addition to those pre
sented bythe Miners' Associailon, are pending
in the Legislature at various stages of prog
ress. The cood feeling between the miners
and the valley people remains undisturbed
and in spite of the presence of some opposi
tion the miners will likely get about what
they ask for this year, especially as they are
asking no new appropriation or any legisla
tion affecting any other c. asses unla\orablv.
Mr. Ford yesterday stated the condition of
mining legislation at Sacramento as follows:
"I was especially interested in -he bil re
approprititin? ior resrsining-dams the $250,
--000 now in the treasury for that purpose ;ind
probably unavailable through a technicality.
1 found that it had been reported favorably
by two committees in the A.-^embly and its
second reading nas been made a special order
for Tuesday next. Then? is plenty of strength
to pass it in the Assembly. The opposition, |
which is not great, is led by Dibble of San |
Francisco, the only City member opposing It
Chynoweth of Orange is also against it Dibble
tries to delay it and to keep up the false im
pression that it is an appropriation which will
take money out of i.he treasury. The Senators j
from the mining counties are not so harmoni- j
ous about it, though they differ only about de
tails. The bill will pass the Senate easily if
the mining Senators only agree. If any ag
gressive oj.position to the bill appears it will
be when it comes up for final passage. >
"The feeling in the Legislature is friendly to
the miners and any reasonable legislation they
ask for will be passed. There is no dangerous
organized opposition, and it seems only ne
cessary to see that the measures do not get lost.
The bill relating to mining locations, approved
by the Miners' Association, has been reported
back favorably, with some amendments ia the
Assembly and without amendments in the
Senate. We presented bills absolutely repeal
ing the obnoxious statutes allowing any stock
holder to recover $1000 for the failure of a
miningcorporation to post a statement of cur
rent accounts monthly and requiring the con
sent of two-thirds of the stockholders to sÂ»U
real estate belonging to a corporation. In
committee these laws have been modified,
allowing the stockholder only actual damages,
thus curtailing the opportunity for blackmail,
and providing that a majority vote of the
stockholders may dispose of property. The
bill giving a min-.T a lien on a inine located
in agricultural ground as weil as in a mine
located under the mining laivs will undoubt
edly pass. Other measures relating to matters
of detail may be passed."
The promised great and rapid mining de
velopment of British Columbia will di.spay
rich mines and extensive paying enterprises
without doubt, but it also promises to be at
tended by a good deal of wildcatting and to
suffer from the over-capitalization of mines
and the marketing of worthless properties. It
is stated that the total capital stock of thirteen
mining companies fo mcd in British Columbia
last week was $10,300,000, all of which com
panies may possibly be conservative and suc
cessful. But Engiish capital is turning with
special indulgence to British Columbia, and
this year will doubtless see many brave at
tempts on the part of speculative promoters to
float large stock companies in London and
elsewhere and a considerable percentage of
disasters. In this connection the following
paragraphs about our neighbors from the
financial column of the current issue of Lon
don Truth are interesting flashes from the
great center of mining investment:
The New Uoidfielis of British Columbia, Limited,
has been formed to conduct the business usually
carried on by an exploration and agency company,
more particularly in the province of British co-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SU N D \Y, FEBRUARY 7. 1897.
I lurnbla The capital Is fixed at Â£250,000 In Â£1
shares. The object of the promoter-, of this com
pany is. no doubt, to do a big business if the? are
successful in getting the money. According to ihe
prospectus they do not' po-sess a single property,
every;h:ng is In the future, and the directors will
await the advice of the Canadian advisory bo.ird
| (who are very far off) before entering into any con
tracts. This is rather curio is. but if the public
find the money, properties of some sort or another
no doubt will be found.
A cnrlous circumstance Is revealed by a letter
sent by Messrs. Lumley <fe J,nmley to the financial
preÂ»Â»: The New Gold fields of Bti'ish Columbia,
Limited, th â  prospectus of which was issued a few
days ago, will hay* a namesake under the tile
of the QoMfields of British Â« o'u-nbia. Limited,
and.it may be assumed that the latter company
was registered before the one which has just been
so hurriedly brought out. I do not think much of the
New Golafietfsof British Columbia. Limi'ed. and I
hope, trier-fore, that the other undertaking will be
a more valuable one. I need bard'.y warn my
readers that they siiould be extremely careful with
reference to new British Columbian enterprise*,
of which I hear we are to have quite a rush,
Dan de Quille completes In the current num
ber of the Mining and Scientific Press a highly
interesting account of the possibilities of
American Flat and the proposition being
talked of by mining men of Virginia City and
! Gold Hill of draining the "flat" by a tunnel
! which would cut through the underlying
I quartz veins at a depth of irom 1000 to 1500
feet. The mountain would thus be prospected
and drained at the same time.
American Flat is a baMn-like depression
covering several hundrea acres, south of the
Gold Hill mines. There are many quartz
lodes below the basin, and there was a rush to
them in the Doom times, when American City
nourished on the flat. Most of the mines
were drowned out by the floods of surface water
at 500 feet or so, and where the battle was
kept up with powerful pumps, final defeat was
acknowledged at 800 to 1000 feet. In the
abandoned Rock Island is a wide vein yield*
ing ore running from $80 to $100 a ton, and
in the Baltimore, silver ores running higher
were found. There Is a large supply of the
opinion that a main brancn of the Comstock
lodo underlies American Flat, and that
bonanzas are hidden there. The Idea is to ex
tend the Sutro drain tunnel to American Flat
from the Crown Point or the Alta on the Com
stock, the length of the extension required
being 7500 feet Irom the Alta. This is an
alluring scheme, and seems to carry the last
possibility that the glories of the boom times
will ever return Vo Virginia City.
The illustrated lecture on the cyanide pro
cess delivered in Academy of Sciences Uall
last Monday evening by Professor S. 3. ChrlÃty
of the State University greatly Interested an
audience that overflowed the hall. Professor
Christy has long given special stady to the
problems connected with this comparatively
new method of gold extraction, and he nas
made important contributions to the science
and literature of it. His laboratory history of
the process was of special interest to metal
lurgists present. One of the things that he
em; hasized was that the delicate process
could not be successfully operated by any one
but an expert cliemlst and metallurgist. It
would not do to set up a fine plant and hire a
muscular miner to operate it. Tnere is much
advance to be made in this process, but, valu
able as it is and will remain, it will continue
to be one rather supplementary of the older
proce-ses. Professor Christy adrised the saving
of all tailings of as low a value as 50 cents
a ton, aa they might be sold at a profit one of
these daya. The problems connected with the
cyanide process with which metallurgists are
now laboring concern mainly the getting of
the gold out of the solution after it hai been
dissolved. The cyanide process as already put
iuto practical operation mine treatment of
tailings and low-grade material which could
not be worked at a profit by any other known
m-jthod is an invention of tremendous value,
but its cheapness and effectiveness will be
greatly increased in the near future without
doubt. Though the interest in the cyanide
process is very wide in California, this State Is
yet far behind other portions of the West in
its adoption, there being but five plants in op
eration so far.

The new mining companies registered In
London in 1896 numbered 857 with a total
capitalization of 94,419,194 pounds. Tins
phows a considerable decrease compared with
1895, which ls^due to the crest falling off in
the formation of New South Africa companies.
There was an increase in the companies formed
to operate in the other gold fieldsof the world.
This is another showing of the fact that the
South Africa boom has passed its zenith and
that English capital Is turning to other fields.
The coal product of Oregon in 1895 was
73,685 tons, valued at the mines at $248,000,

1896 will probably be placed at similar figures.
Part 1 of the seventeenth annual report of the

WHY THEY WERE FAVORED
That Is an I- qu-ry Before the
Grand Jury Concerning
Morgan & Co.
Their Bid for Heatin; the Mission
High School Accepted Though
It Was Highest.
The Grand Jury on Friday showed an
active interest in Morgan & Co.'s contract
for heating the new Mission High School.
There were several bids for the work and
Morgan & Go.'s was the highest. Mor
gan & Co. 'a plans conflict with the plans of
the architect and necessitate a remodeling
of the latter, which adds several thousand
dollars to the cost of the building. Not
withstanding this fact, together with that
other that their bid of $9496 was consider
ably above that of the next highest bid
der, the contract was given to Morgan &
Co. This is why the Grand Jury, which
it especially organized for the purpose of
asking questions about peculiar trans
actions of this kind in the public service,
has evinced such a lively interest in Mor
gan & Go.'s contract.
They are anxious to learn why the con
tract was awarded by the Board of Educa
tion to the hignest bidder in tbe first in
stance, and in the second why a plan of
heating was adopted that could not be
made to conform to the architect's plans
for ihe building.
In the midst of their search for informa
tion they detailed a committee to go round
to the offices of the Board of Education to
secure the plans left there on file by the
contracting company as required by a
paragraph of their contract, and the com
mittee was informed that Morgan & Co.
had withdrawn the copy of the plans and
that therefore the jury could not see
them.
The effect of this, as might be guessed,
was to whet the curiosity of the jury.
They will insist upon seeing the original
specifications, the architect's plans, Mor
gan & Co.'s plans and all tbe other plans
and bids. Ther will insist upon knowing
all about this odd transaction.
A number ofwitn sses were heard on
Friday in the matter, am"ng them being
W. B. Webster, representing W. W. Mon
tague & Co., W. Cronin, the Novelty Iron
Company, J. G. Grannis & Co., A. E. Cross
and George H. Tay &Co. The matter will
be pursued further this week.
Reed and Dockery.
Speaker Reed and Congressman Dockery
are getting quite chummy nowadays. Mr.
Dockery makes suggestions and loafs up
around the Speaker's desk a good deal.
Yesterday, says the Washington Times, he
corrected an announcement made by the
Speaker, and the correction was gracefully
received.
The other day there was a sharp little
tilt between Mr. Barrett and the St eaker.
Mr. Reed was at great pains to make his
ruling clear, but Mr. Barrett insisted
that a clear interpretation of the English
language showed the Speaker to be wrong.
"Tne interpretation may not be correct,
bat the House has thought it correct for
a long time."
By this time Mr. Dockery was leaning
on the side of the Speaker's desk.
"That was right, wasn't it, Dockery?"
whiÂ»r>ered the Speaker.
"Most undoubtedly," aaid the Missouri
man, and business proceeded.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
THE FAKE AND THE FACT.
T"Eâ¬E3 FAKE
The Examiner published for several days at the
top of its title page the following fake:
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
249,757 Inches
Of Ads During 1896.
5964 More
Than were published by any
other San Francisco newspaper.
In the publication of this fake the Examiner
vis probably not aware that a careful record was
being kept of the actual amount in Inches of its
Bdvrrtltiog and that in consequence It could be
confronted with the following fact.
THE FACT
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
236,528 Inches
Of Ads During J896.
That is one fact and here is an
other :
THE CALL PUBLISHED
239,551 Inches
Of Ads During 1896.
3,023 More
Inches were published in
THE CALL than in the
Examiner during J896.
It Is to be remembered that daring 1898 the
Examiner published approximately 800 Inches of
Illegal lottery advertisements, of which The Call
did not and would not publish one.
'1 he monarch of the fakers has doubtless suc
ceeded in securing thousands of inches of adver
tising during the past year by dup;nj and deceiv
ing advertisers through false and arrogant asser
tions of the character of the foregoing fake. It
â would seem, however, from the facts tbat the
merchants as a rule have not been misled by Us
lraudulent pretenses.
The Examiner boasts that Its hooks are open to
Inspection, but we suggest that it Inspect its own
looks before it ventures UDOn the publication of
another fake.
We congratulate the public on the fact that the
fxrosure of this fake led the Examiner to drop it
yesterday. In this the Examiner was discreet, and
if It it wise it will make no mere such bold at
tempts to deceive the public.
Beware of the tarred boodler.
Bragging of a fake doesn't make it
news.
The Examiner will now try to dig up
some hush money for the Butler paono
graph.
In offering home-rule to Cuba, the
Spanish play a good card, but it isn't
trumps.
If Willie Hearst were not a sharer in
the rascality of his subordinates he would
prosecute some of them.
A sign of the times â Hearst. Lawrence
and Bierce; Turners, Twisters and Steal
workers. Examiner editorial-rooms.
In several Legislatures bills have been
introduced this winter to forbid football
matches â and the cranks keep turning.
The Chronicle yesterday wrung so much
of the lie out of the Examiner's brag on its
news service that there isn't any brag
left.
Huntington pays Hearst, Hearst pays
Lawrence, Lawrence pays Bierce and the
end is not yet; there is still the devil to
pay.
It goei without saying that the Exam
iner's interview with Butler was received
over the same wire as the Li Yung Yuen
dispatch.
Unless another subsidy is forthcoming
from some corporation the Examiner will
drop its telegrams altogether and rely on
fakes and stale stories for news.
To publish a dispatch a day after it has
appeared in other papers and then brag of
it as a scoop is Long Green's idea of the
way to run a fake paper when subsidies
glva out.
The Examiner asserted yesterday that it
Bent Senator Money to Cuba as its repre
sentative, and if the report ever gets to
Washington Money will talk war in a
way that will make Willie crawl.
The Chronicle was slightly in error yes
terday in charging the Examiner managers
with an overuse of the pastepot. It is a
tar-bucket they use in that office for news
and advertisements as well as for business.
Long Green is his name.
And I will not deny
In regard to that same
What his name might imply.
But tne way he works Willie "is peculiar,
And he isn't too c'reeti to be sly.
Concerning the statement of Sam Jones
that hell is within half a mile of Boston,
all we have to say is that we have noticed
an extraordinary eagerness on the part of
the Boston fellows to incorporate their
buburbs.
SENSATIONAL METHODS.
In exposing yesterday the .â¢ensational and fraudulent methods by which the
Examiner seeks to obtain a -reputation as a newsgatnerer the Chronicle threw a
striking sidelight upon the course of the Examiner in dealing with municipal af
fairs as exposed by The Call. The methods of the blackmailing sheet in
faking news are not widely different from those which it employs in faking public
opinion in order to extort money from wealthy corporations.
Among the recent frauds upon the public perpetrated by the Examiner in its
news columns are the sensational Creelman dispatch announcing that the
President of the United States had entered into a secret conspiracy with the Spanish
Government for ihe purpose of crushing Cuba, the farcical report of a dispatch
from the Emperor of China to Li Yung Yuen announcing that he had arrested all
the relatives of the murderers of Little Pete, between midnight and 4 o'clock of
the day following the murder; and last, tbe fake interview with the Australian
suspect, Butler, which Butler has emphatically denied, both to the press and
through the medium of a phonograph.
These three salient fakes are a little more conspicuous than the others, bui
thare were many published between the date of the Creelman dispatch and the
Butler interview which were equally false and fraudulent, though not so sensational
at the time.
In addition to fake news the Examiner runs fake advertisements â which it obtains
by offering a "yard of daisies" or a "yard of pups" to any one who will bring them
in. These advertisements are not genuine. They are frauds upon the people, and any
one who expends even as much as a postage stamp in answering them is to that
extent swindled by the faker. Moreover, the Examiner seeks to further defraud the
people In its advertising, as it does in its news, by wholesale lying in its editorial
columns. As it braggartly and impudently announces every now and then some
worthless fake or stale story as a scoop in news, so does it exaggerate and lie about
its advertising in order to deceive people into the belief that merchants regard it as
a good medium for making known their business to the public.
The faker of news and the faker of advertising is consistently enough the faker of
principle and of public opinion. When it observes that any strong popular senti
ment is directed to a particular object it begins at once to devise a means of deriv
ing a profit from It. If the movement happens to be a general demand for a
cneaper service by some public corporation, the faker at once becomes a black
mailer. It directs its energies to inflaming the public mind by appeals to passion,
to prejudice and to ignorance in order to work up a force which it can use to enrich
the pocket of its proprietor, or his subordinates, by extorting money for silence.
The course taken by the blackmailers in the present contest for cheaper water
and cheaper gas is an illustration of its methods. While The Cam, urged the
Supervisors to perform their full duty in niakine a thorough investigation of the
affairs of the water and gas companies, in order that data might be obtained on
which to base an accurate calculation as to what would be reasonable rates for
water and gas in this City, the Examiner took a different course. It began to de
nounce former Boards of Supervisors as boodlers, the corporations as extortioners,
and to demand arbitrary reductions which in their nature would be a spoliation
of the capital invested in the company.
Here again it showed its capacity for lakes and its delight in sensationalism, as
it had done in its dispatches from Creelman and the Emperor of China. This
time, however, it meant eomething more than to delude the public. It desired to
obtain from the water and the pas companies subsidies like that which It ob
tained from the Southern Pacific Company when it received ?1000 a month in
payment for "fair treatment."
The exposure of these repeated fakes, frauds, swindles, lies and successful and
unsuccessful attempts at blackmail on the part ot the managers of the Examiner
have long since disgusted the people, but it is the duty of legitimate journalism to
expose them again and again as often as they occur. Vice cannot be crushed by
letting it alone. It is never safe to overlook a stale egg until it has been buried,
nor to ignore a skunk until he has been killed and his skin nailed to the wall as a
warning to others of his kind to keep off the premises.
"We are aware that Mr. Hearst has repeatedly endeavored to exonerate him
self from the shame and disgrace of the frauds and blackmailing schemes which
have been exposed in the Examiner office by throwing the blame upon his subordi
nates. The public, however, cannot permit him to excuse himself on such false
pretenses. If his subordinates have not divided with him the plunder obtained by
fraud and extortion, why has he not prosecuted them? Why has he continued to
keep some of the foulest among them in his pay? Wny i? it that he is forced to
employ dishonest men to run his paper? Why does he keep men around him who
have Â£o little reputation to lose that they are willing to bear the odium and the
odor of the Examiner when he throws it upon them?
MATTHEW G. UPTON.
Ry the deatn of Matthew Q. Upton
California loses one of the ablest, most
forceful and roost useful of that genera
tion of journalists which is now rapidly
passing away. He was one of the pioneer
editors of the State, and throughout his
life served as an exemplar of the virtues
and talents which made the early journal
ism of California remarkable for the great
ness of its accomplishments and the
power with which it molded public
opinion.
Although he served the profession of
journalism in many ways, his most dis
tinguished services to it and to the State
were rendered as an editorial writer. For
this work he had a native talent which he
developed to its highest power by careful
study, incessant exercise and a high ap
preciation of its importance to the world.
With him editorial writing was something
more than a transitory comment upon
passing events. He made it a means of
public education, and in his hands it
served the purpose of warning the people
of every danger which threatened their
municipal ana National Hie, and of direct
ing them as to what course they should
pursue in politics to guard their personal
interest and their public welfare.
His services to San Francisco are among
the greatest which have been rendered by
any citizen. He made a careful study of
all municipal affairs, and being devoted
to the cause of honesty and truth, as well
as of municipal progress, he became a
fearless and efficient champion of popular
rights and interests against all forms of
evil or of injury which threatened them.
It is to be doubted whether any editorial
writer of hia time exerted a stronger influ
ence upon the community in which he
lived, and it is to the credit of the people
of San Francisco that they recognized his
usefulness and were prompt to follow his
leadership in matters of public concern.
California can ill afford to lose a man ol
â ucb character in the editorial profession
at this time. His trenchant pen is needed
now to redeem the noble profession of
journalism from the taint and stain of
those sensational and vicious newspapers
which are so aptly called "decadent." It
Is needed also to stiil guard the public
welfare against the assaults of blackmail
ers and corrupt rascals of all kinds. It is
true that there are still men to uphold the
cause which he so ably championed, and
that there remain great newspapers to set
forth in California the principles of right
and legitimate journalism, but none the
less we can ill afford to spare the man who
was so eminent in bis service to the pro
fession and to the State.
If the Examiner would expend more
money, care and energy on its news
service, it would not have to resort to so
many fakes to keep subscribers and adver
tisers, nor would it have to brag so fre
quently in its editorials to make up for
the discredit of its local reports and foreign
telegrams.
Fake advertisement given with a yard
of pups for 15 cents may bÂ« profitable to
the fake Journal that runs them, but they
are frauds upon the public and swindle
every man who is deceived into spending
as much as a postage-stamp to answer
one of them.
It is all very well for Willie Hearst to
declare whenever a new Examiner scandal
comes out that his confidence has been
betrayed by dishonest employes, but if he
doesn't profit Dy their dishonesty why
doea he employ that kind of men?
In order that he may throw the blame
of the frauds and fakes in his papers upon
his subordinates, Willie Hearst takes good
care to employ subordinates who have no
reputation to lose.
If all the counties get all they want there
will be big bills to pay.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1897.
THE NEW TARIFF.
The work of framing the new tariff law
has been so well advanced by the Repub
lican members of the Ways and Means
Committee that it has been possible to
make public a general outline of the rate
of duty which will be imposed on the
more important articles of import which
come into competition with American
products. The advanced report as given
is full of encouragement to the industries
of all sections of the country, inasmuch
as it dyes assurance that they will be pro
vided in the bill with an adequate pro
tection against the cheap labor of foreign
countries.
Broadly speaking, the new tariff Is de
signed to provide the country with about
$50,000,000 increase of annual revenue,
comprehensive proteciion to American
industry and the re-establishment of a
system of reciprocity treaties which will
open for American produce profitable
markets on equal terms in all parts of the
globe. Each of these three things is in
itaeif good, and taken together they form
an aggregation of industrial and com
mercial benefits whose value to the
country and the people it would be hard
to overrate.
It is satisfactory to note that due atten
tion is paid in the tariff to the importance
of protection to the agricultural industries
of the country. There will be no more
of the folly of free trade in the so-called
raw material importations. The country
has now learned that what is called the
raw material of one industry is the fin
ished product of another. Wool is the
raw material of the manufacturer, but it
is the hiehest form of the product of the
work of the sheep-grower. It is necessary
therefore to impose a protective duty on
wool as well as on woollen goods if we are
to deal fairiy with farmers as well as man
ufacturers. The required protection will
be given in the new tariff, not only on
wool, but on all other farm products, and
the agricultural interests of the country
will be relieved by its operation from the
long depression which has followed the
adoption of the Democratic tariff.
So far as the work of the f Tamers of the
tariff has gone the industries of California
have received adequate consideration.
We share in the benefits which will be de
rived by the whole country In the restora
tion of the McKinley rates of duties upon
the products of farms and market-gar
dens. Therates upon oranges and lemons
have not yet been faxed, but it is reported
they will be adjusted in a manner to meet
the wishes of California fruit-growers.
The duty provided for imported cattle will
afford to ihe stock-raisers of California
and the Southwest generally a sufficient
protection against the competition of
Mexico. Taken altogether California
fares well, and along with the rest of the
country has good reason to be satisfied
with the terms of the proposed measure
and gratified with the prospect of its
speedy enactment in an extra session of
Congress.
PLUG-HAT CENTENNIAL.
News comes to us from London that
they have been celebrating over there
the hundredth birthday of the plug hat.
The inventor of this imposing style of
headgear was John Hetherjngton, and be
made liis tirst public appearance under it
on the 15th of January, 1797.
So startling was the innovation in head
gear that on the 16th of January, 1797, the
inventor was arrested and brought before
the Lord Mayor charged with a breach of
the peace and with inciting a riot. The
prosecution proved that several timid
women fainted when they saw the strange
fight coming down the street, that chil
dren screamed, and that a young man was
run over and got his arm broken in the
panic that resulted.
In his defense the inventor maintained
Â«â  stoutly as the ladies of Chicago are
now said to be maintaining the momentous
theater-hat question that be had a free
man's right to dress as he pleased. That
his plea was sound is shown by the result.
He succeeded, despite of fainting women
and the protests of the prosecuting offi
cers of the Crown, in introducing the tall
and shiny tile, and bis service to fashion
has merited commemoration In the cen
tennial just celebrated with glorious pomp
and circumstance.
London did well to celebrate the cen
tennial of the advent of the hat nick
named "plug." but rightly called ''silk."
Its merit is proved by the fact that, unlike
other fashions, it has not tired humanity
in a hundred years. Without it modern
dress would lack its finest touch. It is
often ridiculed, but it holds its topmost
place unshaken in the esteem of well
dressed men.

MR. HEARST'S HATCHETMEN.
Abuse by Them Is Equivalent to a Certificate of Good Character.
From San Francisco Town Topics.
The day has long since passed when the blackguardly abuse of young Hearst's journalistic
hatchetmen could injure any public man. As things now stand the enmity and abuse of
tnese degraded journalistic drabs is equivalent to a certificate of good character, because it
necessarily raises a presumption to the effect that the jerson who has drawn it has refused to
discharge his public duties in such a way as to eid that peculiar species of "modern metropol
itan journalism" with contracts with large corporations, against which it has been working
up a hostile public feeling, for "fair treatment" at the rate of $1000 per month. It goes with
out saying that the Board of Supervisors should readjust and reduce the schedules of gas and
water rates in this City, but it also goes without saying that in doing so the members of the
board should exercise their own Individual judgment as business men and refuse to be either
led or coerced or cajoled into a course that Is designed to aid the depleted Hearst exchequer
rather than further the interests of the con suming public.
TENDS TO A DISHONEST END.
From the San Francisco News Letter.
The course of the Examiner tends to a vicious and dishonest end. It opens the door and
makes more easy of attainment results that should be desired by no good citizen. A false
public opinion would become a fulcrum by which dishonest officials would be able to extort
tribute from every corporation doing business in San Francisco. It would compel every
corporation, as a matter of self-protection, to resort to the corrupt use of money in order to
sacure simple justice and save its innocent shareholders from disaster. It would bear to
relation to the Individual rights or burdens of the people- The parading of lengthy petitions
proves nothing. The general public mind is so constituted that it will sign almost anything
without hesitation, and the lists of names presented to the Supervisors are not entitled to more
weight than the paper on which they arc inscribed. Similar sheets placed about the streets
demanding a cut of one-half in the price of bread or boots or oveicoats would without doubt
be signed by every thoughtless passer-by.
KO SECKET TO THE PUBLIC.
From the Ban Francisco Wasp.
The purpose of the Examiner's ferocious assault along the whole corporation line Is self
evident. The public does not need to be told what it is. A journal which but a short time ago
and under the same management which now controls it was drawing a large subsidy from the
Southern Pacific Railroad cannot pose with much consistency as a reformer of corporation
abuses. Nothing in its course since it was stricken off the railroad company's payroll has
indicated an elevation of its moral tone. It is therefore to be presumed that if it got a favor
able opportunity to collect a few thousand dollars a month again in subsidies it would gladly
avail itself of the cnance. It would have been better for Dr. Clinton if his journalistic ally
maintained a discreet silence and permitted the Investigation of the water company's affairs
to be conducted in a decorous manner. We do not see how the company could dare refuse to
allow such a proceeding or fall to lender any legitimate information requested by the Board
of Supervisors. Any stockholder has the right to such knowledge, and certainly the Board of
Supervisors, which exercises much control over the affairs of the water company, could not be
denied the privilege which is extended to a stockholder.
THE FAKER OUTDOES HIMSELF.
From the San Francisco Chronicle.
Yesterday's Examiner, not looking for the exposure of the fact that all the truth In its
"exclusive Madrid cablegram" of January 12 had appeared in the Chronicle during the
previous month, resumed its bouquet throwing and catching with a complete abandon of joy.
Under the legend of the "New Journalism" It printed a facsimile ot the headlines and part of
the text of its second-hand and moth-eaten scoop and put near it a blank space to describe the
Madrid news upon January 12 of the old journalism. Knowing that it had merely revamped
dispatches which the old journalism had mado stale with much use, it declared that it "had
given the first news the world received of the plan of Spain to give to Cuba the autonomy pro
posed by President Cleveland." Perhaps, in its solt-boiled judgment, it thought that the fake
would pass undetected, but every one with half an eye saw Its character at once. The story of
what Spain was ready to concede to Cuba was as familiar as a thrice-told tale, and its flaring
repetition in the guise of a triumphant scoop simply proved again that what is new In the
"new journalism" is not true and what Is true is not new.
Nor is this aIL The cablegram, so called, of January 12 was not only out of date when
published, but the news given as its final verification* was printed twenty-four hours after the
Chronicle had it. To demonstrate this we print the Chronicle's dispatch ot the 4ih and the
Examiner's of the sth of February bide by side on page 9.
The Examiner's belated story appeared with a Madrid date line. Evidently It was sent
from London Instead, where the resident "commissioner" of the n. j. found it In his morning
copy of the Times. What he did was to paraphrase the report and send it here one day after
thin paper had printed It Where the Times said "this assembly will be composed of thirty
five members. Twenty-one of these members will be elected by the people of Cuba; six will
be elected by the different corporations and the remainder will be selected, one a magistrate
one a university professor, one an Archbishop and five former Senators or Deputies," the
London rehasher for the Hearst publications wrote: "This body will be composed of thirty
five members, of which twenty-one will bo elected by popular vote and six by the leading
municipal and provincial corporations. The remaining eight members will consist of a lead
ing magistrate, a university professor, an archieplscopal delegate and five ex-Senators or
Deputies." Similar points of resemblance or proofs of identity the curiout reader may pick
out for himself. The text Is full of them.
It is but fair to observe that so long as the old journalism buys the news the nsw journal
inn will have something anywhere from a day to a month after, with which to invade the
privacy of iv columns; but what would happen if the exchange system should break down or
the new journalism should be deprived of pastepot and scissor* can only be surmised by those
of vivid imaginations and morbid tastes.

ART AND INDUSTRY SHOULD BE UNITED.
By Professor Henry T. Ardley of the University of California*
How few people pause to inquire how much the whole civilized world is Indebted to the
industrial arts for its prosperity and happiness. *
I refer to those professional industries that owe their value chiefly to art rather than the
material used or the labor expended upon them â such, for instance, as art furniture,
carpets, wall-paper, . drapery, book-bindings, fresco, mosaics, ceramics, stained glass, orna
mental work In stone, wood, iron, brass, gold, silver, leather, etc. The prosperity of many
cities, statea and nations depends almost entirely upon those art9^ivhich lift, the raw ma
terials of a country from their crude, useless
condition to their highest market value, and
wherever these art industries are the most
pronounced we nnd the most lastiug pros
perity, for in selling what they make and in
making what they use their money is both
made and kept at home, while nature fur
nishes the material.
Now, California is a very large consumer of
articles' of art and luxury, and must either
make them at home or purchase them abroad,
bo that anyone may sec how very important
I California is a very large consumer of
s of art and luxury, and musteuher
.hem at home or purchase them abroad,
any one may see how very important
this bjoct is to this great and growing State,
where so much rew material is awaitinp de
velopment, or is sent East and bought back
agnin nt an enormous advance,' while we pay
the freight both ways. We sell our wool for a
few cents a pound and then buy it back again
at $2 per yard in a carpet!
If we could but cut California off from the
rest of the world for a few years we should
soon experience a great wave of prosperity in
our industries. The wheels in our factories and
lof the world for a few years we should
experience a great wave of prosperity in
ndustries. The wheels in our factories and
the shuttles in our looms would soon be hum
ming all over the State, for we are blessed witn
sucb a wide range of natural resources that we
could make ourselves independent of the
world; but as lonsr as communication makes
it easy for us to buy everything elsewhere and
we are willing to do so, W9 shall continue to
build up the industrial arts in other parts of the world and drain this State of millions ol
dollars every year while thousands of our own people are seeking employment.
If you emer any of our large stores selling art furniture, carpets, drapery, china, jewelry,
etc., you will find them loaded with the imported products of Europe or the Eastern States
and containing almost nothing made in California, and nearly all the applied art work that
has been done here â from a simple mosaic to the decorations of the Mark Hopkins houseâ haa
been done by foreigners imported for the purpose.
This is all wrong, for the great problem in the industry of the nations has come to be a::
esthetic oneâ how to give attractive and useful torms to their productions in order to gain and
hold the markets of the world and supply the wants of their people at home.
Professor Miller said in hfs address to the National Potters' Convention in New York: "Now,
let us learn from our neighbors on the other side of the ocean who are beating us to-day In our
own markets. Consideration for the arts and for the methods of their advancement is a mat
ter of grave public concern.
"The land rings to-day with the demand for forts and a navy, â¢ â¢ â¢ but I tell you there
are things we need a great deal more than either, and higher industrial standards and more
practical methods in education and purer tastes in art are some of them."
We only scratch the surface of the question of art as applied to industryâ Europe digÂ» Into
It! France and Germany were not fiercer rivals at Sedan than they are to-day in their efforts
for promoting art education among their people.
At the head of the Government Art has her minister ns well as War, and millions are spent
every year by the Governments of England, Germany and France in such education, while tho
United States Government spends nothing, but sits with folded hands while millions of dollars
go abroad for art work that should be done at home. Our manufacturers are progressive in
many ways, but not in art.
Mayor Phelan said some excellent things upon this subject recently at the Mechanics'
Institute Fair, when he pointed to the fact of foreign goods "forcing their way into out reluc
tant market," and the fault largely resting with our education. He pointed to the technical
schools of Europe, where the young are trained in the useful arts.
This is in fact the keynote of the whole situation, and herein lies the remedyâ to train tha
young mind on its native soil in pure art principles, and their hands to skill In applying
them. We cannot tear up elsewhere a national art by its roots and replant it Here and expect
it to flourish. We might as well expect to tear up a full-grown tree and have it bear fruit just
as well in a new hemisphere. But we may safely sow good seed in a new soil and expect it to
grow into a healthy plant, adaptel by nature to Its new environment.
Our Commissioner of Education in Washington says in a rfcent report: "It Is evident
from the history of the past few years that the people of the United States are large consumers
of articles of art and luxury, and it is certain That the consumption of these articles must
largely increase. The question of who shall produce them is of vital importance to the edu
cator, the taxpayer and the political economist. Shall they be made in other countries by
foreign artists and artificers?
â¢â To have only the technical skill of the blacksmith or the carpenter will not suffice. It
is a higher skill, a more refined form of labor that can alone meet the coming demand The
training to qualify workers to meet this must be absolutely artistic, and in order to create
men and women to do this great and important work at home we must foster the irerm of
artistic thougnt and feeling in the youthful scholar."
I must here quote a line or two by Professor I. Edwards Clarke of the Bureau of Education
V\ ashington, D. C. : "In this country we make too great a distinction between 'art 1 and the 'In
dustrial arts. ' They always flourish tne best when united-when Raphael and Michael Angelo
made designs for the potters, the silversmiths, the weavers and the carvers Designs that
made the most costly materials a hnndred-fold more valuable, until they are to-day exhibited
in the great museums of the world, and treasured in the palaces of kings. What we need in
America is more skillful artisansâ artisans who are artists. We have enough picture Daint
ers, but we need to bring together the useful and beautiful." l
This we are not doing, for our artisans know nothing of.art, and our artists little of the In-
Of course, we have some technical and "manual training" schools In thla country but they
are merely teaching old mechanical methods and 'ilmple processes which are not 'mentailv
elevating enough, and do not foster or encourage artistic thought and feeling. In Europe tho
pupils learn to adapt their work to all kinds of material In the various styles of the different
periods of art. This exalts their work and elevates aid interests the student and he is eradu
ally led to admire and to produce beautiful things. '
Suppose you enter the woodworking department cf an average technical schoolâ will
see that they are learning tosaw a board, make a joint or "draw" with rule and compass and
perhaps they could construct a kitchen-table. Now, juppose you ask them all teacheri and
students, to combine their united efforts and adapt this same material to a Gothic Renais
sance or Moresque table on original lines. '
Could they do it? Ask them hgain to ornament it with the art work of the period it rewre
sentsânot copied or altered, but original. They wouU be lost porioa v repre-

I m< dern languages" he turned his attention to
j ,'oamaiism. What tn equipment for a pro
fession, whose members more often, like Topsy,
"just growed.' It recalls Eugene Field's re
' T>ly to a question asked him just after his re
turn from abroad as to what he had found to
be the greatest difference between writers in
the Oid World aud the New. Mr. Field said
that what struck him particularly was the
amount of training men hadover there. Athor
ough knowledge of the classics and the mod
ern literature of all countries gave them the
perfection of form, the mastery of style which
our writers so often lack. Yet, on the other
hand, our men were apt to have greater fresh
ness and originality of expression. We may
Etretch this consolation further by recollect
ing that part of Pierre Loti's marvelous charm
and vividness if ascribed to his having been
euch â & Bmall reader. He takes his impressions
of life and nature at first hand, and the result
is singularly unhackneyed.
'Sudermann, however, has not only a pro
found insight, but also a mastery over mere
technique which nothing but years of train
ing will give. He is a free lance and holds
with no particular school; part of his work is
romantic and part harshly realistic in treat
ment. For examples, contrast his "Dame
Care" with "The Wish." The former is an ex
quisitely written story. The atmosphere of
the book is the mystic haze of romance rather
than the snarp light of realism. The picture
oi the hero, Paul, through the care-burdened
yoars'of his childhood, boyhood, young man
hood; of his love for nis mother and his de
sire to shield her from the effects of the selfish
ness and incompetence of the domineering
father, is drawn with 60 tender and sympa
thetic a touch tnat one fancies it a memory
cut of Sudermann's own life. We see his hero
followed always by that gray, shadowy figure
of, "Dame Care," wno had presided at his
birth. In spite of his toil, his selt-denlal, his
faithfulness, we see nis desires frustrated, his
hopes brought to naught until the final re
lease comes in the love of the beautiful pirl
toward whom, in his hopelessness, he had so
long cosed his heart and who at last brings
into his life the light of joy before whfch all
shadows vanish. The whole is an idyl, a sort
c: prose poem.
"Tne Wish," on the other hand, Is a terribly
realistic study of the influence i'pon character
.of a single evil wish unuttered and unacted
upon. The treatment is psychological. The
Etory opens with the closing act of the tragedy,
arid later the author goes back and traces all
the-influences which led to the final catastro
phe. Considering the theme the story ia re
markably free Xrom morbidness. In fact, Sud
ermann never, like the French realists, dwells
overmuch upon sickening detaiil. Neither is
he like that traditional Frenchman who bad
little to say, but said that little long. He is
essentially dramatic. The turn ol a phrase
indicates a character, an exclamation shows
us a situation. So that it is as a dramatist that
Pudermann is at his best, and in the ethics of
hih dramatic work it is easy to trace the influ
ence of Ibsen.
It was during Sudermann's boyhood that the
Norwegian playwright left his native land;
and shook, as he said, the dust of that coun
try forever from his feet. A voluntary exile,
he took refuge first in Italy, where he wrote
his three great poetical dramasâ "Brand,"
"Peer Gym" and "Emperor and Galilean,"
a~nd later settled in Germany, where he has
ever since remained. There, by means of his
pu"re dramas, he has carried on an unfaltering
criiEaii'j against social and political evils. All
young Germany became fired with the re
actionary spirit. "The divine right ot indi
viduality," the "freedom of personality." were
the warcries. The conflict was between the
older generation and the younger. The older
stood for the established order, the respect for
tradition, the enforcement of parental author
ity. The younger contended for liberty, for !
the right of self-expression. It is this' con
flict which Sudermann has portrayed in this
"Heimat," and which has been rendeied into
JtngJish under the name of "Magda."
. It seems singular that the German title,
which is so significant, was not retained.
This, however, was not Sudermann's first
dramatic work. His "Hono-," published a
few years earlier, made him a famous man.
He was as much talked about aa Ibsen him
self, and his work became the subject of many
discussions. It Is a scathing satire on the false
of the day, on the aristocratic sense
' fcf honor, which the author contrasts with the
plebeian sense of duty. This work still re
mains Sudermann's greatest success, but it is
less familiar to American audiences than hia
"Magda," which has frequently been given in
this country. The latter is a favorite part
with Modjeska, with Bernhardt and with the
Italian, Duse. "Honor" was followed by "The
Destruction of Sodom," another satirical
drama, still more pronounced in tone. It was
go plain-apoken that it was expurgated by the
Berlin censorship, and has never, to my knowl
edge, been staged for an English-speaking
.audience. In this Sudermann lashes the fol
lies and vices of fashionable life.
The strength of "Magda" seems to me to lie
In its moaeration. We are shown both sides
of the question. Our sympathy is not all for
Magda even in her first triumphant assertion
of her own individuality; nor all for the
father in his honest clinging to the old ways.
We feel poignantly that he and the ideas he
represents are not all in the wrong; nor is
Magda and this new gospel of freedom wholly
in the right. A strong apDeal is made on both
Mdes. Our sympathy shifts from one to the
other of these terrible Contending forces. As
we watch the individuals we are conscious, so
great Is the drcmn, of mighty questions at
stakeâ not merely of one passionate daughter
and one domineering father, but of the un
ending struggle tietween the old and the new.
The opening act, with its picture of a stifling
. provincial atmosphere, all commonplace nar
rowness and cant, induces our sympathy for
Magda's rebellion.
I It is probably only in reading the drama
' that we realize how great is .Sudermaun's skill
in portraying with so few touches the cnvi
.ronment which Msgda has broken away from.
Good acting makes any situation expressive,
but iv a dispassionate reading we discover the
strength or the weakness of the dramatist, aud
this test Sudermann stands triumphantly.
Magda's father, the old colonel, specks of the
â¢â¢good old patriarchal order." He scorns mod
ern ideas. "Modern ideas! Oh, pshaw! Iknow
them. But come into the quiet homes where
are bred brave soldiers mid virtuous wives.
There you'll hear no talk aboutheredity.no
arguments about individuality, no scandalous
I gossip. There modern ideas have no foot
' hold." Again, he says: "In this house rules
: oM-tHslnoned paternal authority ; ana it snail
j rule as long as I live." And this same "pater
nal authority" had ten years before, meeting
with a will as strong as his own, driven from
her home the rebellious daughter who refused
! to marry at her father's bidding.
In the discussion by the gentlemen of the
card club we are further enlightened as to the
point ol view held by these worthy people.
General yon Klebe is fuming at having been
: detained by the crowdâ "such a crush of
: people gaping as if there were a princess at
: the least. And what do you suppose it was? A
, singer! These are really what one may call
j goings onâ all this fuss about a singer!" He
j is amazed at having seen the pastor in the
crowd. "Now, I ask you what did he want
there, and what good is this whole festival,
and all this so-called artâ what good does it
do?-
Bockmann, the professor, answers with a
trite commonplace, "Art raises the moral tone
! of the people," and the general replies, "I tell
j you, art is a mere invention of those wlio are
I afruid to be soldiers to gain an important posi
j tion for themselves." j
i This Is the atmosphere Into which Magda,
brilliant, triumphantâ a queen in the realm
she had won for herself â returned for the mo
ment. No wonder all the efforts to detain her
are unavailing until the pastor she has scoffed
atâ the man whom her father years before had
commanded her to marryâ obtains the influ
ence over her which springs from the un
selfishness 01 his own motives.
She resents the least suspicion of constraint
or authority. She says to him: -litre I was
parched and stifledâ it's all so far behind me.
: If you only knew how far! You have sat here
day after day in the heavy, close air, while I
have felt the storni breaking about my head.
Pastor, if you had a suspicion of what life
really is !" His 8 tandards seem narrow to her.
She doubts his sincerity, but gradually his
earnestness, his self-effacement, compel her
wonderâ almost her awe. She is persuaded to
remaia for a few days at leapt, but she chafes
at her position. She says to him: "Hero 1
must bend my will. I am not accustomed to
that. I must conquer. I sing or I liveâ for
both are one and the sameâ so that men must
will as I do. I force themâ l compel themâ to
love and mourn and exult and iamen t as I do,
and woe to him who resists. I sing them
downâ l sing and sing until they become
slaves and playthings in my nauJ.<. I know
I'm confused, but you understand what 1
mean." And the pastor answers: "To work
the impress of one's own personalityâ that's
what you mean, isn't it, Magda?"
"Yes, res. Oh, I could tell you everything.
Your heart has tendrils which twine about
other hearts and draw them out. And you
don't do it selfishly. You don't know how
mighty you are. The men outside there are
beasts, whether In love or hate. But you are
a man. Just think t Yesterday you seemed
to me so small; but something grows out
from you and become always greater. What
shall I ca;l it? Self-sacrificeâ sell-abnegation?
It is something with self, or, rather, the re
verse. That is what impresses me and that is
why you can do so much with me." And what
a touch of nature is that which makes the
pastor confess that the sight of this triumph
ant, dominant personality has awaked old
desires at war with self-effacement. |
"1 have had to stifle much in my nature.
My peace is the peace ot the dead. And as you
stood before me yesterday in your freshness,
yonr natural strength, your greatness, I said
to myself, 'That is what you might have been
if at the right moment joy had entered into
your life.' "
And when, as the consequence of the old sin,
shame ana sorrow overtake this household it
is the pastor who prevails upon Magda to make
the supreme sacrifice ol herself for the sake of
her child.
"There comes an hour to almost every man
wheu he collects the broken pieces of his lite
to form them together into a new design. I
have found it so with myself. And now it is
your turn."
And when she has consented and then re
fused because she sees that the >acrifice would
be in vaiu, her father is stricken by death, and
Magda in her anguish begs to be allowed to
remain in this home she has shattered. But
the reader feels that no real solution of the
problem is here, and that the Magda Suder
mann draws would chafe, when the sharp edge
of remorse was worn awuy, at the old restric
tions. Mme. Modjrska, in accenting the
womanly side of Magda's character, has given
us a very noble interpretation of the pan, and
has helped to smooth away the difficulties of
the outlook.
I fancy it ia not without meaning that Su
dermann gives the last words to the pastor.
And by this he may Imply that, not through
the assertion of individuality, but by tne sac
rifice of it, Is the question answered and the
problem solved. Grace S. Musser.
HOYT'S QUOTATIONS.
A CYCLOPEDIA OF PRACTICAL QUOTA
TIONSâBy J. K. Hoyt. New York: Ti.e Funk
<fc Wagnalls Company. For sale *t all bookstores.
Prices: Buckram $6, law sheep 98, half morocco
$10, full morocco Sl'2.
The merest glance directed at this the latest
of a series of useful works ol reference issued by
the Funk & Wagnalls Company will show the
reader that immense pains have been taken to
render it of permanent value, to all who have
occasion to use a book of ou tations, and who
has not atone time or another? The originul
edition was published in 1882, and since that
time has proved to be a strong rival of even so
well established a favorite as Bartlett's famous
work.
Perhaps the most striking characteristic of
this new, revised and enlarged Hoyt is its mar
velous thoroughness. It is claimed, and ap
parently with good reason, that "every famil
iar phrase and sentence that has currency in
the English language will be fcund among the
30,000 quotations in this book." Another
good and prominent feature of the work un
der review is to be found in the fact that an
unusually large number of facilities are afford
ed for quickly turning to any desired quota
tion. Alter the name of each author in the
appendix are the numbers of the pages where
quotations from him occur. The quotations of
eight of the most prominent authorsâ such as
Shakespeare, Miitun and Longlellowâ are des
ignated in the index by special symbols so as
to be recogniz.d at a glance. Three distinct
keys are afforded to gain access to quotations.
They are: The topic; the entry of each sig
nificant word or phrase in the concordance;
the name of the author. Equally easy refer
ences are afforded for finding foreign proverbs
and quotations, Latin law terms, etc They
may be found by turning to: The toplo; the
author; some word ol the original; some word
of the translation.
The Funk & Wagnalls Company are to be
congratulated upon their enterprise in plac
ing so valuable a work of reference tostudenta,
clergymen and writers on the market at what
is really a moderate price.

This is a new edition of a book which on its
previous issue met with a deserved meed of
praise. The first story in the collection,
which tells of the sentinel who, from a sense
of duty, sends a fatal bullet into the horse
upon which the sentinel's father is sitting at
the top of a steep cliff, and describes how horse
and horseman fell from that great height as
though some spirit were flying from the sky,
is a piece of picturesque word-painting
finely done. The author's descriptions make
a vivid impression on the memory, and in
such pictures as that of the hero on the white
hurso, who volunteered to gallop into sell
sacrifice in order mat the fire of the enemy
drawn upon himself might disclose their po
sition, will return many times to the mind's
eye oi the reader more like to the recollection
of some fascinating scene he has viewed on

hayÂ« a work that will commend itself to all
who have felt the deficiencies on the score of a
lack ol completeness which characterize the
parent work and the appendices to the same
which have been issued from time to time.
In addition to naving given the new supple- |
ment biographical enlargements to cover j
those persons whose names have been made j
famous in literature, science and art during
recent years, we note that other departments
of no less importance have been thoroughly
covered. Thus, the heading "Bible Distribu

last months of 189 G. Subjects essentially
American or which possess especial Interest
for the American reader are also treated In
their latest phases, while matters scientific are
shown to the last word. In the latter connec
tion we note the caption "Argon"'â proof posi
tive that the supplement is up to date.
In the "Guide 10 Systematic Readings" (2)
the student who is desirous of using Encyclc- i

friend indeed. This plan of instructing the j
seeker after knowledge as to the best way of !
culling the same from the masterly volumes j
comprised in the original Encyclopedia, seems
to us a particularly happy one. The first part
of Mr. Baldwin's work is devoted to such por

particularly designed for students, while the
third is set apart for the general reader. The
author has done his work well, and a good

By O. A. Myers. O. A. Myers. Lot Angeles, Cal.
Paper, 50 ceuts.
The main purpose of this little volume is to
try to convince the people from a non-parti
san standpoint; that if any true benefits are
to be derived from protective, tariff laws it is
equally necessary to have stringent immigra
tion laws. In addition to his arguments ou the
subject of tariff and immigration laws the
writer has some lengthy ones in favor of Gov
ernment banking and Government ownership
of railways and telegraph lines. He holds that
in times of loss of confidence financial panic
and consequent hardship are caused by people
withdrawing their money from the banks, but
if their money had been deposited with a Gov
ernment bank they would not have lost con
fidence and prosperity would not have been
interrupted.

The #nbjects introduced are unconventional,

to one who is a master of fiction could such

This is a story of murder, and the mystery
of the perpetrators of it is so cleverly con
cealed as to keep the reader curious and
guessing till the last chapter in the book. For
those who like tales of horror and the mental
exercise of trying to nnravel a mystery that
baffles the shrewdest of detectives this tale
will be very interesting. It is a very disagree
able story, though, to those who do not like
that style of fiction. The horrible tale starts
thus: "There was a great deal more blood
about the room than any one would have ex
pected. Not to speuk of the pools on the car
pet and the quautlty that soaked through the
clothing, more than a score of spots could be
counted on the wallpaper, half as many on
the Dictures and several on the furniture."

McClure's Magazine for February con
tains a tea poem by Rudyard Kipling, iilus
trated by Oliver Herford. Since the puDlica
tion of Kipling's new boot of poems, "The
Seven Seas," there is a special interest in him
as a poet, and particularly as the poet of the
sea.
Mrs. Lanier has prepared a new edition of
her husband's, Sidney Lanier's, "The English
Novel," and there will be in it passages not
included in the first issue. The Messrs. Scrib
ner will publish it shortly. The same house
has ready Professor Charles F. Kent's second
volume of the "History of the Hebretf Peo

Since retiring in large measure from edi
torial duties In Atlanta Joel Chandler Harris
has been busily engaged in several iiterary en
terprises. Hitherto "Uncle Remus" alone has
been associated with his name, bat indications
arc that the grout Jiune of his first success
may be shared by his new novel, "Sister
Jane." Mr. Harris,' juvenile books, it is re
ported, will occupy his time xor a considerab
period.
Dr. Weir Mitchell, author of "Hugh Wynne,
Free Quaker," now appearing in the Century,
is hearing much from Friends regarding
his novel. It is felt by them that for the first
time the Quaker is having justice in fictionâ
usually he is caricatured and made untruthful
or ridiculous. Even the stern father is liie
like in Dr. Mitchell's story, and the gradual
emancipation of the hero from the bonds of
his i&ith is well and naturally told.
Joseph Jefferson, the actor, is also an artist
and is greatly interested in the revival of an
old-time method of picture-makingâ painting
upon copper, from which a single print is
taken on paper. In the February Century
there is an article by William A. Coffin on
thefce "Monotypes." Among the monotypes
reproduced in the article is one by Jefferson
himself, the original of which is in the Play
ers' Club in New York; another shows him at
work in his studio.
Announcements of books dealing with the
life or work, or both, of William Morris follow
each other in quick succession, says the Lon
don Westminster Gazette. The latest is that
Buxton Forman is preparing a volume which
will bear the title "The Books of William Mor
ris: an Essay in Bibliography." It will set
forth in a connected narrative "the public ap
pearances of the author in a way calculated to
give the student and collector such exact
bibliographical knowledge of the whole of tho
printed works as the present age requires con
cerning not only great men l ; ke Morris, but
many minor literati." Mr. Forman, whose
address is 46 Marlborough Hill, St. John's
Wood, London, will be glad to hear of "any
out-of-ihe-way items cognate to the subject of
a work at once narrative and bibliographical."
A series which will be most cordially wel
comed is that which the Macmillan Company
is preparing to issue under the title "Heart of
Nature Series." The derivation of the title is
from that exceptionally popular juvenile,
"Tommy-Anne and the Three Hearts," by
Mabel Osgood Wright, who very appropriately
is one of the authors of the first volume of the
new series, "A Bird Book for Beginners."
The second volume will probably be some
"Native Animals," edited by Frank M. Chap
man, who writes of "Four-footed Americans";
a third, "From Moss to TTee," will not be a.
systematic botany, Dut a book, on plant life
lor beginners, giving a concise story of a
hundred or more species that are either beau
tiful or useful. The "Insect Brotherhood,"
edited by Samuel H. Scudder, will describe
various kinds of stings, wings and things.
"When the Earth Was Young," edited by
RaiphS. Tarr, will be a general introduction
to nature study. "The Making of Home,"
sanitation, etc., outdoors and in, entitled
"The House People," will be edited by Dr.
John S. Billings. It will be a book of stories
of home life, showing how all study of animal
and vegetable lite, physical science, etc., has
a very close and practical bearing on the
building up of the home, etc.
The February Forum opens with an import
ant article by Senator David B. Hill on the
"Future of the Democratic Organization."
Mr. Hill severely criticizes the Chicago con
vention, wherein, he sayÃ, Democratic usages
and principles were ignored from theoutse:,
old and well-established Democratic principles
repudiated and new and dangerous doctrines
substituted. Fidel G. Tierra. chairman of the
Cuban press delegation, in "The Present and
Future of Cuba" presents an authoritative
account of the actual condition of affairs in
the island. He is confident of the ultimate
success of the revolution, and emphatically
declares that no compromise between Spain
and the revolutionists is now possible. Thera
are now but two issues: Incessant warfare or
independence. The lion. William Woodville
Rockhill, Assistant Secretary of State, reviews
the status of our consular system and points
ou t some evils yet to be remedied before it can
reach its highest efficiency. "Ladies' Clubs in
London," by Miss Alice Zimmern, describes
the aims and objects, comforts and
advantages of the leading London
clubs for women. "The Results of Cardinal
Satolii's Mission" are told in an interesting
article by the Rev. Dr. Edward McGlynn. The
forthcoming publication of the "Autobi
ographies and Letters" of Gibbon the hia
toriau, in their original form, after being
sealed up for 100 years, is an event of rare
interest. Mr. Frederic IlHrrison, the distin
guished English critic, reviews these volumes
in an article entitled "The New Memoirs of
Edward Gibbon." Dr. J. M. Rice contributes a
third article in his series on the Problem of
Elementary Education, entitled ''Economy of
Time in Teaching," directing attention to the
limits of incidental instruction, the influence
of fatigue, and the question of mental ma
turity. Among other interesting articles in
the February Forum are: "Speedy Financial
and Currency Reform Imperative," by the
Hon. Charles N. Fowler; "The Cure for a
Vicious Monetary System," by Senator W. A.
Peffer; "Poe's Opinion of 'TheÃavea,'" by

FASHIONS FADS AND FANCIES
The newest style of hairdresslng. The effect Is obtained by using a round Pompadour
frame, which forms a complete circle. The back nair^ is drawn loosely over it and pulled
through the aperture in the center, where it is lormed into puffs and an upstanding loop.
ET SP3EMS to be an established fact that
braiding is to be very considerably
_. employed, but the braiding will
be very different in character from
that seen so much a year ago, for some of
the most beautiful examples from Paris
have open-work flowers in crochet Jet into
ttie material in the midst of the braiding,
and especially in vogue are blacK figares
on the cloth and canvas dresses, just com
pleted as models for the coming season.
The ungraceful Â«kirts composed of many
useless yards of stuff are vanishing, and
stiffened gores are things of the past; in
deed, it has been a sore trial this wearing
of skirts that were certainly fashionable,
but sadly uncomfortable and the cause of
many a headache.
To return to the braiding in tailor
gowns, Mrs. William Whitney has juÂ«t
received one from her tailor. It is of a
clear leaf preen cloth, with a vest of real
turquoise blue satin. The green is largely
toned down with shadows of gTay among
the folds, and then the inevitable braiding
comes In to farther dignify; but the braid
ing goes exclusively on the front panel of
the skirt, taking the form of a frameworr
of a rococo panel, or mirror, that cer
tainly commends itself to the eye.
This is seen on many a new sfcirt, but if
no panel or large figure effect is adopted,
what is designed as a rose-and-dart design
embellishes the bottom of the petticoat.
It is noteworthy that not one in fifty
ekirts goes out innocent of any hem deco
rations, and that there are two new and
admirable braidsâ one a broad, satin
finished band, which, when applied, looks
like a wide satin piping, and another,
rough, half-silk, half-wool weave known
at porcupine soutache.
Tailors are makine a great exertion to
impart to their gowns such an air of style
that they may be in favor for many occa
sions, and their success has certainly been
satisfactory, for at a Waldorf musicale Mrs.
Jack Astor's tailor pown excited no little
admiration. It was of a bluish purple hue.
On the front of coat and skirt and lower
balves of sleeves of the smooth-finished
spring weight of camels' hair a large Per
sian figure is cut out and patched with
cream wool twill. Where the edges of
clotn meet each other fine black silk
braiding is done in looping*, and then
the twill's face is well covered with orna
mentation in yet finer and more intricate
braiding.
Where the most delicate tendrils of the
vine-like figures run off, black silk em
broidery is set in, and under the first collar
of violet camel's hair a second of twill
folds out over the bust, its points and
edges graced with braiding. At least
three dickeys and neckbands accompanied
this suit â one of white satin, sparkling
with jet beading, another of violet velvet,
decorated with a double row of close-set,
email, cut-steel buckles, and a third of
black satin.
After perusing such a description we
can understand the prices asked and
rapidly obtained East for such gowns, as
assuredly they are well worth from $100
to $200.
.Novel and Oliic Creations.
Some delightful models are being sent
ont this month from London and Pari-*,
as smart women have finished with their
costumes made during the first part of
the winter and are demanding novel and
chic creations to wear to the varied enter
tainments that are being arranged for the
gayest part of the season, but visiting
dresses are also receiving their serious
consideration. One such conception would
please most of us, as purple moire velours
enters largely in its construction, the
skin being perfectly plain and entirely
composed of this fabric. The narrow and
continuous vest is in black satin piped
with cream color, and the front of black
mousseline de soie is over purple, the
same shade of which lines the entire dress.
A 101 l ruche of black chiffon will be worn
with this toilette, which is edged with tea
colored Valenciennes lace. The toque is
composed of pinkish mauve roses, tea
colored lace and a natural colored bird of
Paradise leather.
A new weave of cashmere, commercially
known as "cashmere cloth,*' ia much liked
in Paris, so a young matron here has had
a very successful frock evolved from a
soft tan shade, embroidered quite beauti
fully in a black and light tan braid. A
say little vest gives the necessary touch of
color. It should be remarked that the
skirt is but four yards wide and fits like a
glove around the hips.
More elaborate iÂ« a costume, ordered by
a bride, of shot silk of an artistic green
shade. Quite a quantity of black ribbon
velvet trims it; indeed, ribbon velvet
figures on many imported costumes, but
is used comparatively little here. Cream
white guipure lace faces the jaunty short
bodice and the sleeves, and a very deep
corselet of blact satin gracefully drapes
the waist. The very small vest is of sheer
chiffon over green.
A novel little cravat effect of weasel's
fur is pretty, and the high, soft collar is
adorned with a narrow band of the fur
and tT?o points of the guipure. The hat
is of an unusual shape, with a square ap
pearance in front, and is made of velvet
of a rich brown shade, a green bird of
paradise and a little guipure lace.
A picture rare was a wee bit of a matron
the other day at an informal little tea.
Her gown of pale gray cloth was exquis
itely embroidered with silver and a shade
of amethyst silk, now so fashionable. The
entire costume was fashioned over this
siik. The jacket-like fronts ol the bodice
revealed a waistcoat of pleated tulle, with
a cravat in bow form also made of the
tulle. This reminds roe, girls, to tell you
that all the smart girls in New York are
wearing cravats of pale chiflon tulle. Try
one. Tney are wonderfully becoming.
At intervals in the embroidery were in
troduced amethysts with delightful effect,
and her gray velvet chapeau, faced with
amethyst velvet, had one of the new ser
pent buckles at one side, in which was set
an exceptionally fine amethyst. Kven her
gloves were stitched with this, to her,
most becoming color. Marcella.
Fresfy Fpom Paris. â¢
From Paris have just been sent ont some
oioth dresses with heavy open si!k em
broidery. They came each in a separate
box, and are completed with boleros
formed by the insertions set in the cloth.
These most desirable novelties are made
with broad bands of satin, and should
have little vests of real lace. Only first
class dressmakers can handle them wild
a hope of doing justice to the fabrics.
Very smart is a costume worn by a well
known social leader and donned occa
sionally by her when calling. It is of the
finest and most beautiful quality of dark
brown face cloth. The skirt is edged with
jable and lined with a golden green shot
taffeta. The chic rever is also made of
this silk, covered with some old Irish
lace and edged with sable. The waist
band and neckband are of black satin,
the collar being completed with a roll of
fur. The quaint toque of brown velvet of
a dark shade has three handsome up
standing ostrich tips at the left side, held
in place with an odd ornament of Indian
workmanship. It looks like a loose knot
and is studded v.ith emeralds. The crown
is embroidered to carry out the idea of
the ornament and is wrought in dull sold
and small emeralds. Marcklla.
Black, Skirts and Light
Waists.
In Paris skirts of the tinest black cloth
are being expensively worn with light
colored waists, made severely plain of the
heavy new weave of cashmere (drap
d'eie) or of vipogne or cashmere. Pale
grays, pinks, Delft blues, reds, greens and
petunias are iasuion able colors. In from
they fasten with simple pearl, gold or
silver buttons, like a shirt waist, and the
fronts are made with from four to five
pleats. Generally they are belted witn
the new monkey-.-kin belts, which are to
be bad in all the newest shades, mounted
with gold or old silver buckles, richly en
crusted with turquoise and garnet. The
swellest of belt* are of gold, enriched with
Russian enamel. The sleeves are very
moderate in size and have cloth waist*
bands that button.
The collar is turn down or stand up, ac
cording to the wearer's fancy, and very
frequently a little lace is used at the
throat. Such waists are sometimes lined
with Florence silk. White serge and
grain-yellow are dressy and becoming
shades much liked.
Bodices of black or colored velvets made
in the same way are already enjoying a
great vogue. Many are gathered at the
waist or tacked and open on the side
without showing any fastening, instead

.Net Dresses.
These are daily increasing in favor for
evening wear. Some have simple skirts,
accordion pleated, with bodice* gathered
into the waist beneath a handsome sa-<h.
Sometimes the sleeves have short puffs,
but I prefer those composed of tiny lace
i edged frills. In some cases the sleeves
J wrink.e down to the waist. Usually thÂ«
j t'.ecolletage is mo9t becoming when cut
I round. A graceful spray of flowers at
j one side gives a finishing touch to a gown
which has enabled many a debutante to
look lovely during the past month, and
we may rejoice over the fact that net is
| supplanting in favor mous-<eline de soie
! and chiffon, as it is a hundred limes more
] desirable. Of course, all smh eowns have
I a silk or satin foundation. Very pretty is
such a irock j ast home from a lending
dressmaker's. The skirt is gathered from
waist to hem, over a silken slip, with
flounces of lace put on at intervals In a
round shape dipping toward the front,
and rather high in the back.
This style is much in evidence in New
! York, and is extremely charming, when
carried out in figured net with very fine
real lace. Also I hare just heard of the
same idea carried ou: under the most.
expensive circumstances in the finest of
chiffon, with lace ot the most exquisite
quality inserted transparently, keeping
i the same form â low in the front and high
in the back.
Greatly admired also, are some net
dresses, which have lace insertions in the
hem. Grenadine is being used in the
same way for young women and the
debutantes, as it is now obtainable in such
attractive evening shades.
Beautiful Ball Dress.
This may be said to be a combination of
the magnificent and the simple, being
I made of a brocade of pink shot with yel
' low, patterned with a ribOon design, fol
; lowed by a lace effect The skirt is
1 pleated on the hips and trimmed at the
hem with two rows of'fine lace, headed by
a band of guitmre, just fastened back on to j
the second pieat with loops of rose-pink
velvet ribbon, buttoned with diamonds.
'I he bodice shows a sort of double bolero,
the one made of the rose-rink velvet elab
| orateiy worked in tinsel of many hues,
and the other of the brocade pleated to
form a rever. At the toack is a pointed
belt of the embroid reel velvet, In the front
a vest of the softest cream-colored lace;
then again on the sleeves the embroidered
velvet is used, ar.d from the top of these
emerge two puffs of the brocade. The
decolletage is cut to show the shoulders,
with straps of rose-pink velvet, fastened
with diamonds, holding the bodice se
curely.
Describing the moÂ«t beautiiul gown

j York ball Vogue says: Among ihe

silver daisies embroidered en relief, thÂ«

"The bodice was round, fastened on the

Latest Evening Gowns.
A heliotrope brocade, much admired
at a recent reception, has orchids in the
bodice, as well as some gf>ld and pearl
passementerie. Heliotrope mousseline is
used for the short elbow sleeves, and forms
the frill that extend* down the lift side of
the skirt. The effect produced by it is
Known as the crossing skirt, because it is
presumed to give trfe idea that the skirt
crosses over; the bows of plain satin rib
bon, which adorn plentifully the entire
gown, are pretiy.
Felix lately completed three models,
the descriptions of which I quote, hoping
they may be duly appreciated ; but to con
fess the truth in the matter, I prefer
the designs of our well-known dress
makers. The first is spoken of as
having a low-pointed bodice and slightly
trained skirt in mos k -green moire velvet;
large velvet bow on the point at the back;
charmine and artistic Louis XV corsage
drapery with loop epaulettes, harmoniz
ing with the panel robings in cream satin,
edged with rare guipure and all aglow
with radiant roses, hand-painted in
variegated hues amiast soft lace ap
pliques; oblong diamond bucklos. In the
coiffure shines a rising-sun ornament in
gems and diamonds resting against a bow
of shell-pink satin ribbon.
The second is a robe of black net spangled
with either steel, silver or gold and clev
erly wrapped on the riÂ«ht side in the loose
empire style over a princess gown in black
satin. Short bolero in keeping, edged !
with sequin lace and cut to meet on either j
side the opposite points of the fan-shaped
epaulettes in fluted wire net. Tufts and
garlands of pink leaHess roses cover the
short sleeves and outline the square open
ing of the bodice. Other roses or loops of
pink moire >ilk veiled with sj angled net
happily relieve the brunette headdress
i with a light touch of color. A few de
tached blossoms are besides strewn on
the hanging drapery. Bertue of finely
pleated net.
The last mentioned has a low, close-fit
ting bodice and oval trained skirt, mount
ed with three pleatings at the back in
denteile point de Paris, elaborately
trimmed with graduated stripes of large
velvet leaves, brightened up with a splen
did gold and multi-color jet embroidery.
Detached leaves are sparingly studded
over the berthe flounce, while narrow
bands of foliage define the pointed waist
and opening of bodice. Short sleeves in
black velvet, gathered into a double puff.
In the coiffure at the back towers: a single j
white ostrich feather, curling toward the
front, and below the Greek kn->t sparkles
a gem buckle in the center of a windmill
bow composed of loops in shot-yellow rib
bon. White gauze fan. painted with a row
of medallions, with showers of paillettes
in rainbow tints.
Wftite Satin.
This is usp-1 with good results for a
dainty girl. Round the foot of the skirt
is a ruching oi mousseline de soie. The
satin bodice has a butterfly front of white
mouÂ°seline de soie, and the silver and
pearl galon is quite decorative.
It is nn excellent idea when a light
hued satin skirt begins to soil nround trie
bottom to tiave a bias piece of material
sewn lightly round the skirt; then over
this have a niching of tuile, mousseline
de soie or chiffon. It will make tne skirt
look perfectly new and fresh and thus de
lay the departure of the gown to me
cleaner's.
Old rose glace is a very fashionable
fabric this season, and one such dress. has
a bodice scalloped at the neck, each scal
lop being edged with an ivory whi:e
pleating of tulle. In front the corsage is
embroidered with bands of steel and sil
ver paillettes. The plain skirt is made
according to the style now much in vogue
in Paris; that is to say, it had a gathering
of a thipk cord about the hips, and this
throws toe fullness in the most graceful
way just where it is needed.
A yellow satin made in this City and
much admired has the entire front of its
bodice beautified with embroidery and
falls of soft old lace. An empire bodice
said to be constructed on quite new lines
is made with an oddly shaped bolero of
gray satin. It has a broad waistband of
white satin ; at the neck are bouillermes
of gray and white satin, and crossway
folds oi the same form the bodice.
The skirt shows again folds of the satin.

, For tfye .Men.
No first-class Eastern tailor would now
think of putting a breast pocket in a coat,
and I am thankful for its disappearance,
as it totally ruined a good garment, and
certainly it was not necessary to loudly
announce the fact that one owned a hand
kerchief, as such articles are scarcely ever
used in public nowadays.

shirts have likewise vanished, as they
were never of the slightest use.
When in mufti the best-turned-out men
are indulging in bright colors with pic
turesque results when they do not permit
thoir fancies run riot.
Golt suits are owned by most Eastern
society men, and the Scotch goods em
ployeu in the evolution of the trousers are
the only correct fabrics. In coloring they
are more than satisfactory, and the warm
glowing heather mixtures, as well as
bold red plaids, are liked by some.
Single-breasted coats of a heavy cheviot
or black vicuna will be worn with our
knickers. The vests may be of the same
fabric as the coat, but fancy goods are
likewise employed, but not with such
pleasing results.
Golf is bo rapidly gaining in favor in
California that Him's latest remarks on
this important and interesting subject are
well worth reading, so I quote the follow
ing lines:
"The golf suit with the cap to match is
no longer in good form. The ready-made
affairs have driven the combination out.
The new knickers are made of Scotch
worsteds in broad prominent plaid ef
fects. The hose should be of the same
predominating tone as the knickers.
"The Scotch knitters are making hose
now of a lightweight worsted. The legs
are or a plain co'or, or of a warm heather
mixture. The tops have lozenge panels
in very vivid colors. The feet, by a clever
process, Â«re woven to tiie worsted legs;
but they are not made of worsted, but of
lisle or cotton.
"This gives that lightness of texture
which insures foot comfort. Very few
men could bear the warm, itchy worsted
feet, and footless hose were very uncom
fortable and shifty. This new cotton-foot
hose overcomes the discomforts incidental
to woolen feet and supplies hosiery that ia
rugged, comfortable and healthy.
"The knicker for next spring will be cut
vefry much on the same principle as riding
breeches. This will brin<r the buttons on
the quarter-cuff? to the front of the leg.
The cuffs should not have less than five
buttons, ana they should fit without a
wrinkle. When tho hose is rolled up over
the cuff, put the garter on so that two but
tons on the cuff will be exposed. The tops
should then be rolled over, and care taicen

stripes are red and the yoke, waistband a:jd

HUMOR ON
THE FERRY
An Oakland JYlaiden's Sorry flight
and HoW it Game
About.
ffcT was on the half-past 6 evening boat
\ to Oakland that it happened.
o Now, this particular boat carries a
very gloomy and misanthropic load of hu
manity. Indeed, not even the early morn
ing boats coining this way, laden with
people who have been forced to rise in the
chill gray dawn, carry so grim and unso
ciable a lot of passengers as are seen on
this special trip through the dusky shad
ows of approaching night to the regions
across the bay.
A lew of the morning travelers nre, it is
true, San Franciscans who went over to
see their sweethearts â it is a harrowing
fact that some San FranciÂ«cana do have
sweethearts on the other side of the bay
and got left.
There are also among them some mis
guided beings who have be^n lured frora
the peaceful and pious precincts of our
City to spend their nights in unholy rev
elry amid the glittering dens of vice and
iniquity which we have been told on good
authority masquerade under the innocent
name of clubs in Alameda County, and
have, consequently, massive and aching
heads for baggage.
The majority, however, are workmen
who have rested well, breakfasted com
fortably, have appetizing lunches in tbeir
neat little baskets and art facing the pros
pect of a remunerative day's work. There
fora, though sleepily silent, they are for
the most part cheerful, hopeful, and, when
occasion calls for communication amone
them, decently civil in look and speech
and manner.
Not so with the unfortnnates mock
ingly known a 8 -the happy sixers."
They are mostly business men who have
been detained at the office over time by
business or lack of business; clerks who
have been "put upon" in the matter of
extra work; women who have been so
absorbed in the pursuit of "bargains"
that they have paid no heed to the flight
of time until the store doors have been
gently but firmly closed behind them,
and persons who have accomplished tue
unsatisfactory feat of "just missing" the 6
o'clock boat.
This beinfc the case everybody is more
or Jess discouraged, and nearly every one
is crossâ decidedly soâ for they are all
doomed to be late to dinner and to have
that meal served up to them in a frag
mentary, congealed or desiccated state.
No artless children enliven this passage
by indulging in games of tag through the
saloon, tumbling recklessly over cus
pidors and the legs of their inoffensive
and uncomplaining fellow-passengers.
No dulcet strains of harmony are there to
soothe the savage breasts of the belated
ones, for the sleek musicians have shut un
shop for the day and are happily feasting
on macaroni and oil and sour wine and
other dainties in the bosoms of their re
spective families.
So it 18 that, as a general thing, after
the mad rush to be first on board is over
the passengers gravitate to the front end
of the saloon and, sitting there in morose
and stony silence, either feign utter
ignorance of the existence of their fellow
sufferers or stare at each other superb
ciliously witn coldly critical and disap
proving eyes, or openly express by look
and manner their hatred of their environ
ment and thieir disgust at the circum
stances which placed them therein.
Among the "left-overs" the other night
was a tall and willowy young damsel of
haughty carriage, who was crowned wit Q
an enormous hat, beplumed and bebowed
in the latest style, and wore upon her
shoulders one of the very "newest" capes
with a storm collar several yards high.
Although she carried several bandies
it was evident from their appearance and
her manner that they contained neither
plebeian groceries nor dry goods, but'
rather, some dainty and breakable articles
which their fair purchaser did not care to
trust to the untender mercies of a delivery
clerk. It was also evident that she was
one of those happy individuals who feel
that between tnem and the ordinary
human being there is little in common.
There was an air of frosty superiority
about her which wna actually chilling
and when she took possession of the cor
ner seat by the door and sat there, the
personification of statuesque dignity
there were many who forgot their p er l
sonai sorrows for tne moment as they
gazed admiringly at the tip of her
nose, and wondered why so lofty a
young woman did not have her own pri
vaie conveyance across the bay instead of
going over in the same boat with common
people.
Slowly the steampr labored through the
darkness, and deeper grew the gioom in
the cabin, until it was as thick as a Lon
don fog, and then suddenly, as the end of
the trip drew near, the modern Galatea in
the corner seat awakened into life. It was
as though the^spiiit had moved her" to
liven things up a little, and she proceeded
to do it with a vengeance.
Slowly she. arose, took a step forward
and then bet:an to dance a most energetic
and lively jig in the vacant space before
the door.
She hopped np and flown like a jump
ing-jack: she pirouette I like a Javane-e
mouse; she bent and s\v .yed like Kiral.'y
in his best days; rbile the astonished
spectators stared at her open-mouthed,
undecided whether to applaud Her ap
parent efforts to amuse them or to call for
the deckhands to arrest her as an escaped
lunatic.
Wilder and wilder grew her gyrations.
The waving feathers and bows on her big
hat suggested an Indian headdress and
made her performance seem less like a
jie man a ghost dunce.
One or two of tne ladies had begun to
look a little alarmed, when tne impact of
the steamvr agam-t ttie dock-piles sent
the disciple of Terpsichore acainst the
door-j l mb, and with one wild, convulsive
kick, turned apparently at the chandelier,
the dance came to an end and the dancer
disappeared into the darkness outside.
Then, and not uniil then, did the spell
bound onlookers think of disembarking;
and as ihey rose, still wondering wnat it
all meant, to begin tne usual fight lor pre
cedence, a feminine voice solved the mys
â ery.
"That,"' said the oracle, in a tone of
solemn conviction, "is what comes of rin
ging yourself out in one of them wired
skirts and getting your foot caught in it!"

Hiad a Hardware Skop ir\ Her Stomach.
[. People Worxdered What Made tke
JMilk Taste of Iror\
T^JOCKTOWX, N. J., Feb. 2, 1897.â
â â â 5/fc Ninety-two pleres of hardware were
lemr* discovered in the stomach of a cow
belonging to John Risier, a well-kuown
farmer living near here, when it was
killed the after part of last month.
So extraordinary is the case generally
regarded Â«nd so many requests for verifi
cation have poured in on Mr. Riser that
he has made affidavit enumeraiin â¢ the
articles, which reads in part as follows: '
'â¢This is an exact statement of what was
taken from my cow's stomach: One two
penny wire nail, one fourpenny nail, two j
sixpenny nails, eleven eigbtpenny and j
four threepenny cut nails, five f^urp^nny
nails, one fivepenny wrought nail, thirty
nine pjeces of nails, two one-inch screws,
three pieces of wire, three stones, one hoc
ring, one-half threshing machine spike,
a padlock and a piece of chain. In all
ninety-two (92) different objects were j
taken from the atomach.
â¢ "Some of them showed that they had
been there for many months, if not years,
while others ha i apparently been swal
lowed quite recently."
A cow which thrived and grew fat upon
a diet of shingle nails, padlocks and small
pieces of steel-link chain is certainly an
animal whose gastronomic achievements
are worthy of chronicling.
Tender green grass, rich meadow hay or
evojn a delectable bran mash had no at
tA :is for this Jersey when any odd
t 4 ol hardware were obtainable. Her
; 1 nee f-eenied to De for such unusual
thfflgs as spilt??, screws, nutheatls and
pieces of wire.
In only one respect did this cow differ
from any other of her species. She gave an
excellent quality of miik and more than
the ordinary quantity, and how she came
to develop a digestion which for its ability
to assimilate almost anything has never i
Leen equaled is a marvel as yet unex
plained by scientific men.
Ostriches and coats have heretofore been !
the.only creatures re; uted to be able to !
exist upon a loiir continual diet of mis
cellaneous hardware, but for a varied as
sortment of unusual articles which can
b3 taken into the stomach, and the ani
mal apparently experiencing no incon
venience, this New Jersey cow has estab
lished a rer.ord.
How she- came to acquire her peculiar
taste and where she managed to pick up
f-uch odd pieces of nieial no one has as
yet been able to explain. She might still
be making a living hardware-store of her
self had not her owner decided to convert
the living animal into beef for winter and
spring consumption by his family.
"When a few days ago Mr. Risier decided
that one of his cattle must be sacrificed in
order to supply the family with meat he
looked around among hia numerous ani
jnalÂ« v and without hesitating selected this
t articular cow as the victim for the
butcher.
It. was one of the best he owned, and j
such milk as she gave could not be equaled
in the entire State. There was a peculiar
taste to the milk. Not an unpleasant, but
a sort of iron taste, which was rath r
â¢ KTHE COW EATING NINETY-TWO PIECES OF HARDWARE.
agreeable than otherwise, and dairy ex
perts, who have analyzed the fluid said
that there wa3 a trace of iron in the milk,
but they could not account for its pres
ence there. The wiseacrf s of the neieh
borhood decided that it must be because
. there was more or less i.on in the water
the cow drank.
â¢ She was in appearance the fattest and
sleekest of all the hera. Her glossy sides
shone like those of a well-kept racehorse.
There was every indication that the cow
would make prime beef, arid Khe was ac
cordingly sent to the slaughter.
Never was -ti;e old saying that "things
are seldom wnat they eeeni" better illus
trated than when this same cow, metamor
phosed into beef, was returned to Mr
Risler.
Like every honest American farmer he
. objected to being defrauded in any man
ner and when he saw thÂ° beef which the
'â¢butcher sent lie very promptly made a
. Jnos- vigorous protest.
Whereas, he had sent away an appa
rently i ealthy, fat and well-fed cow, he
> received in return a beei which would
throw discredit upon a maverick.
There was hardly meat enough to cover
the tones. What little there was was
. fibrous and as full of muscle as that of
tr| widest steer which ever came over
ttl: drive. A healthy yearling would give
a fetter proportion of meat, and Mr. Ris
lef lost no time in setting out to investi
gate.
After patiently listening to the many
reasons given by Mr. Risier as to why the
meat sent him could not possibly be that
of the cow w ich he had Bent to the
batcher, that phlegmatic individual
asked, "What did you send me anyhow?"
"Why, the best four-year-old cow on my
place, to be sure, ana all you send me
back is the skeleton of a cow," was the
energetic reply.
"Hold on a minute," said the butcher;
'just see what you sent me inside that cow
before you talk about skeleton," and with
that he brought out a peck measure filled
with a varied assortment of hardware
such as was never produced from the
stomach of any cow before.
Mr. Risier carefully looted over the col
lection, and after identifying the padlock
I and a stray piece of chain as some of his
j own property which had been missing for
some months he handed the mass of
metal back to the butcher, with the re
marK: "Well, I was lucky to get even a
skeleton if the cow had to take care of all
that stuff. But where didahegetit? I
guess that explains the iron taste in the
milnâ and small wonder."
It certainly did explain to a certain ex
j tent the peculiar taste ot the miik, but an
explanation as to the manner in which
the cow came to swallow such a mass of
metal is still agitating local scientists and
medical men of LocKtown and vicinity,
who cannot understand how, in the first
place, any animal could possibly swallow
such a heterogeneous mass and survive,
and in the next place, how it was Dossible
to continue an apparently healthy exist
ence under such circumstances.
There is, so far as is known, no record
of any similar performance ever having
been accomplished by a cow or any other
animal. Small stones and even pieces of
metal have been found in the stomach of
animals, but for such a mixed mass to be
found in any one's stomach is without
precedent.
The only theory which has any possi
i biiity is that the cow had a perverted
J taste and took the Dieces of metal into
her mouth thinking they were good to
eat. They passed into her first stomach
: with her regular food in the ordinary and
| natural way. There they remained while
the food of the animal was eventually
diges ed in the ordinary way. Had the
foreign articles been expelled by the first
stomach of the cow the chances are that
she wouid have strangled, while as it was
they were practically of no inconvenience,
and only prevented the animal from be
cominc fat, a form of bloat taking- its
place, which accounts for her well-fed ap
pearauce, while as a matter 01 fact she
was, so far as meat was concerned, as thin
as a razor-backed hog.
So if you notice a taste of iron in your
milk tell the milkman to change the cow's
j feed.
Traveling Town Libraries.
Senator James H. Stout of Menomonie,
Wis., in establishing traveling libraries in
Dunn County at his own expense has done
a service to others than those iin mediately
benefited, for he has given the plan a prac
tical trial that will go far toward securing
its adoption elsewhere. When he made his
first contribution to the plan sixteen libra
ries of thirty volumei each were put in
operation. The number has since been in
creased to twenty-sii, and there is a call
for four more, while all the more lately
purchased libraries ara supplied with
forty volumes instead of thirty. Dunn
County has 15.000 inhabitants outside of
the city of Menomonie, which has a large
public library. The people take a cenuine
interest in the libraries and use them to
the extent of tneir opportunities, and it is
said that the good influence of well
chosen reading i 3 already perceptible.
Similar experiments are being made in
other counties of Wisconsin on a smaller
scale. Iv two counties where there are
large Polish settlements the demand for
boots on American history and politics is
especially encouraging.
Senator Stout's experiment, though
gratifying in its results, does not, of
course, establish a precedent for the way
in which such libraries are to be made
available to the people. It is not every
county, or even every State, that is fortu
nate enough to possess one citizen who
has both the means and the wealth to
make such a venture. Wisconsin, how
ever, has already a system of fr c libraries
founded under a law passed two years
ago, which created a free- library coramis
sioa. The traveling libraries may be
brought under this law by means of an
amendment to include them, and the
friends of the plan are working for this.
Of the value of the plan there is no longer
any doubt. Furthermore, v system so
well adapted to Wisconsin must be equally
valuable in any neighboring Western
State. The subject has been agitated in
Minnesota, but never, so far as we Know,
with any definite result.â St. Paul Pioneer

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1597.
FIVE WOMEN WHO HAVE WON RECOGNITION IN OUTDOOR SPORTS.
AMERICAN WOMEN IN THE WORLD OF SPORT
Quick With the jÃifle, Yet Fear a Mouseâ Jhey LoVe the Exhilara
tiorv of Outdoor Employ me r\t, ar\d Ofterv Excel Their
J^ale Competitors in J-lur\tir\g ar\d DriVirxg
iT^^MERICAX women are rapidly
vli J .' taking to out-of-door sport*. Here
m\k.j are five nho have recently won dis
tinction by their ability to lead in the
hunt, on the wheel and the racecourse.
Shootine, cycling and fast driving are
some of the sports which they have
taken up, and not only have they excelled
their own sex by accomplishing extra
ordinary feats in their chosen amuse
ments, bat they are the envy of many of
their male competitors.
Three of these women are modern
Dianas and have attracted a great deal of
notice in their respective localities by
bringing down game of all descriptions,
both large and smail. Their unerring
aim wi'h rifle and shotgun has gained for
them the admiration of many an older
and experienced hunter.
Another prides herself on having ex
celled in driving fast trotting horses,
while the fifth has accomplished wonders
as a century rider on her bicycle.
There is not the faintest suggestion of
the "new woman" in the domestic life of
any of these women, and aside from being
highly respected in the communities
where they reside, they are excellent
wives, mothers and daughters, as the
case may be, and sport is followed by
them purely for the healthful exercise
and amnsement which it affords.
Mrs. Catherine Helsel is the name of
one of these modern Dianas whose lond
ness for roaming over the mountains in
pursuit of game has left her, at the age of
64, wiiich she reached this month, a
bright, witty and healthy specimen of
womanhood.
At the present time Â«he lives with her
husband, George Helsei, South Board
man, Kalkaska County, Mich. The
earlier years of her life were spent in
Ohio, where she became a devotee of the
rod, line and gun. She accompanied her
father or brothers on their expeditions
and soon became an expert with the shot
gun, and few birds ever escaped her un
erring aim.
More than forty years ago Mr. and Mrs.
Helsel moved to a small town near Grand
Rapids, Mich., and every fall spend sev
eral weeks bunting. As game grew
scarce they continued further north to
where Â»hey are now located, midway be
tween the rich hunting district of the
Boardman and Manistee rivers.
Mr?. Helsel early aspired to large game,
and discarded her double-barreled shot
gun for a Marhn 8-pound 38-caliber re
peating rifle. She has a long list of deer
to her credit, and during one season she
killed fourteen of the fleet-footed ani
mals.
She is extremely modest in relating her
exploits with the rill', but declares that
she is never happier than when in the
woods with her dog and gun, and ay rs
that she now owns tne best bear dog that
ever sniffed a track. She has one bear
skin rUK aiorning her parlor which is
pierced by a bullet from her rifle.
As an evidence of the esteem in which
her prowess is held by her neighbors,
this express on of opinion by her friends
is very emphatic: "If you have any
crack marksmen in your vicinity, you can't
trot them out any too quick. We up here
in Northern Michigan will bet our last
cent on Mrs. Heisel on the run or s ami
ing at any distance under Bixty yardt."
"Tbe Huntress of Jackson Hole" is
the title given by her friends to Miss Mil
dred Bevington, a young Rocky Moun
tain girl, living on the bord.er of Jackson
Hole, in the western part of Wyoming.
She has recently been successful in
bunting game which men usually find
hard to get. She carries a new Sharpless
powder-using JJO-caliber weapon, and re
cently within a week she has killed half a
dozen black-tailed deer.
She baa adopted bloomers as a hunting
costume, but this has been done purely as
a matter of convenience, as dresses are
not compatible with the thick sage
brush of the bunting districts. There
is nothing masculine in her manner, how
ever, and when she sits in her parlor at
home tbore is nothinujin tier modest ap
pearance that would offer the least sugges
tion oi mannisnness.
She uses the soft-nosed bullets, which,
when they hit an animal, spread until
they widen half an inch in diameter. The
deer which she has brought down, as a
rule, do not run more than twenty yards,
and many have died before half that dis
tance was covered.
Sbe finds antelope hunting the most In
teresting and exciting sport of all and de
scribes one of. her recent victories as fol
lows:
"I took my pony and went away up
above the ranch, tethered the animal and
then went along a little bluff to where I
could look off across the open country for
a long way. I brought my field glass into
play, but could not see a singie thing.
Then I went on a short distance further
and scanned the plain again. I had been
out for perhaps an hour and a half when
I happened to see a glimmer of something
over a little hummock not more than 500
yards away. It was just a little speck of
brown that I had seen, and I was not ab
solutely certain that I had seen anything,
but I cocked my rifle and waited. It
seemed so long waitiner there that I had
almost concluded thai I was mistaken.
Suddenly, however, up went something
on the rising ground. Another jump and
an antelope was in eight, followed by four
others. I tried to catch sight of one, but
they were so small in the sights that they
looked tike little bits of rabbits. Pretty
soon I pulled the trigger. The next in
stant they were gone. But I put in an
other shell and ran over to ihe top of the
rise, and there lay one dead. The bullet
bad gone into the back of the head and
torn a fearful hole."
Mrs. F. Eugene Belden of Chelsea,
Maine, is another recent audition to the
ranks of huntresses. Prior to last July
she bad never handled a gun. She was
proficient, however, in the use of the re
volver, but there her skill in the hand
ling of firearms ended. Since that time,
however, she has been in at the death in a
ox hunt, having killed the elusive ani
mal herself.
Her husband is a great sportsman, and
while they were in New Hampshire last
summer he taught her the use of the rifle.
She took to it handily and began by ex
perimenting on bottles. She improved so
rapidly from the beginning that early in
October she accompanied her husband on
a hunting trip into the Maine woods. Slip
sighted a deer while on the expedltiou
and without fear or wavering shot it
square in the shoulder. Elated with her
success she determined to seize every op
portunity of improving her ski!), and
shortly afterward went to Paris Hill, Me.,
to try her luck at fox-hunting and rode in
the fifth hunt of the BuckfielU Fur Club.
The result of the day's sport wai ihat
she killed the first fox â the bugest and
the first evÂ«r secured by a woman in the
nistory of the club. On the day of the
hunt about twenty members ol the club
were r resent, divided into three parties.
In one party were Mr. and Mrs. Belden
and Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Emerton, Miss L.
McQnade and F. C. Mower of Auburn.
When near the signpole one of the
hounds started a fox in one cf the swamps.
As the game scenud to be coming toward
them the party spread out. Boon Mrs.
Beiden's quick eye discovered a fox steal
ing ud th- hill about forty yards distant.
She fired instantly, holding her heavy
double-barreled gun at arm's length with
out resting. The fox tumbled dead, but
she was so afraid that he was not quite
finished that she emptied the second bar
rel into his body in order to make sure.
She is inclined to rest upon her laurels
for the season, but declares that her next

Mrs. Belden is young, pretty and lady
like. She wears a very becoming bunttng
costume, consisting of a corduroy jacket
and bloomers, with high rubber boots and
a corduroy cap to match the suit.
She is iond of ali athletic sports and be
sides being a .splendid horsewoman is a.i
expert swimmer.
Of all out-of-door sports in which women
indulge there is none more healthful or
exhilarating than riding behind a fast trot
ter and handling the "ribbons." This is
the sort of pport Miss Daisy L. Cram of
Knox, Ind-., enjoys, and a short time apo
she broke the world's record for fast
driving at the Plymouth races. It was
her first bona-tiie race, and she corupsteil
with Mrs. Harry Johnson of Akron, Ind.,
and Mrs. C. C. Howard of Marion. She
won with Rockaway in three straight
heats, making a record for lady drivers oj
2:'lA]4, lowering the previous record by
three seconds.
That it takes courage to put a trotter a
mile at this gait no one who has ever sat
in a sulky will deny. This characteristic
Miss Cram has in an abundant degree.
She is the only daughter of Quincy
Cram, formerly of La Porte, Ind., who
movfd to Knoi about two years ago. He
is one of the best-known horsemen in the
State and has helped to make records of
such cracks as American Boy Jr., 2:20,
and PomeÂ» Nix, 2:17.
Miss Cram delighted in working them,
and at the early age of 13 years she sent
American Boy Jr. a mile in 2:30.
In her splendid performance at Ply
mouth she pushed Rockaway under the
wire in 2:21 iv the first heat. The first
quarter of the second heat was done in
33 seconds and the half in 1 :09. The horses
were driven under whip from the turn
into the stretch to tlie wire, and ended
with Rockaway beating Marie Corbett,
diiven by Mrs. Johnson, by a short neck.
The finish was cheered by thousands, and
gained for Miss Cram many fronds and
laurels.
.Miss Cram is a young woman, excep
tionally pretty and very popular in her
home.
One young woman must not be over
looked! in the recital oi wonderful out-of
door accomplishments. She is Mrs. E. A.
Rinehart, the wife of a Denver photogra
pher, and her recent performances on the
wheel are certainly remarkable. Her fa
vorite spin is a century, and a Bhort lime
ago in twenty successive days she reeled
off twenty of them aggregating more than
2100 miles. She is a sturdy and daring
wheelwoman, and lately, in company
with W. R. Marshall of the Denver Ath
letic Club, made a fast century to Colo
rado Springs out of Denver and back.
Together they made the distance of 150
miles in sixteen hours and ten minutes,
over half the distance being covered
against a strong head wind. It was the
first time the trip has ever been made by
a woman. .
The two riders started out on their long
ride at 4 o'clock in the morning and Colo
rado Springs was reached at 1:30 o'clock
in the afternoon. On the return journey
they had tne wind to combat, and Denver
was not reached until 8:10 p. >i.
Mrs. Rme hart 'has also gained the
woman's world's century record by riding
over the Evan3 course in 8 hoars and 5
minutes, a distance of 104 miles.
In speaking of her cycling exploits Mrs.
Rinenart says: "The chief reason I can
give for beinn able to outdistance other
lady riders is that t am not afraid to iide
nione. I always ride when I feel in the
moud for it, and I make an invariable rule
to dress for comfort and service rather
than discomfort and useless style.
"As a rule I take my time when on the
road, making occasional sprints to make
up for loaiing, and invariably finish my
centuries early in the evening. Generally
I ride alone, but I am never afraid and
never stop except to take some refresh
ments, and ride ail the hills possible.
il Tnere has been a great deal said about
my killine myself, but I would like to
state that I weigh 142 pounds, two pounds
more than when 1 bejjan riding a year
ago. I fell oft some during the warm sum
mer weather, but have steadily gained
since."
Mrs. Kinehart's year's performance puts
a total to her credit of U6centuries, cover
ing a distance of 17,000 miles.
FROZEN DY NAMITE MISSILES
The J^eW ar\d Effective War projectile Is a
Shell Filled With the Powerful Ex
plosive y\fter Freezing
I^T^A-SHINGTON. D.C., Feb. 2. 1397- â
aJlliJ In tiae event of any unpleasant-
IH/Mf'i ness with a foreign power, a new
dynamite projectile has recently been in
vented which would cause the warships
of the opposing nation considerable in
convenience, to say the least.
It is a s cli, the most remarkable fea
ture of whicn is that ii contains frozen
dynamite and will not explode until it
pierces the object at which it is fired.
Another entirely new feature of this
destructive mis ile is a slow-burning fuse
sufficiently insulated from the charge to
prevent premature explosion while the
shell is traversing the designated dis
tance. Just what can be accomplished
and the terrific amount of damage which
would result to an enemy by means of
this new addition to our armament can
be slightly comprehended by a glance at
the accompanying illustration, which, is a
photograph of a target after experiments
with the shell charged with dynamite.
Tbe target was of steel, 3 inches thick,
but the explosion of the projectile was
suffici nt to turn back the edges of the
holes into a jagged wreath. The inventor
of this new type of projectile is James K.
Bake well, a patent attorney of Pitts
burg, Pa.
There is nothing new in the shape of
the shell, Mr. Bakewell states, but he is
now working on a different style irom
tliat of the ordinary shell in use at present.
Wfien the party gat here 1 for the experi
ment it was not without some misgivings,
all Leing familiar with the danger of
handling dynamite under any condition.
The Hotchkisa six-pounder, a rapid-fire
gun, rested on a recoil mount. The larpe
three-inch steel target was placed exactly
100 yards distant from the firing-place.
The cartridge used hai been reduced, be
ing charged witn only 700 grammes in
stead of the full service charge of 840
grammes. This test was to establish a
standard of comparison. In this instance
a common armor-piercing steel shell was
used. It was loaded with powder simply,
and fused. As the party felt assured they
THE GUN THAT FIRES THE NEW PROJECTILE.
were working on a perfectly safe ground
in this case there was no hesitation in
pulling the trigger of the Hotchkiss.
The gunner's aim was excellent. The
shell pierced the target almost exactly in
the center. The difference in effect on
the target between the t>owder shell and
the frozen dynamite projectiles following
was very marked, as is shown by t:>e
illustration. The hole where the shell
penetrated the steel is comparatively
clear and clearly cut, while tne remainder
are considerably torn and turned by the
explosion. The initial velocity of the
missile was measured at 1450 feet per sec
ond. When the party repaired to the tar-
TARGET SHOWING THE EFFECT OF FROZEN DYNAMITE.
get the point of the shell was found to
project fully three inches beyond the rear
surface of the plate, wbile the base was at
least an inch from the face of the target.
The fuse had blown out of the shell.
The preparations for the second round
were gone about witn more caution.
This was in reality the beginning of the
experiment, as the frozen dynamite was
used. The gunner did not relish the idea
of standing too near the piece, so a line
was attached to the trigger, and he stood
some distance in tne rear, with the re
mainder of ihe party, to be safe from re
coil or premature explosion.
All the tiring conditions were precisely
the same as those in the first round, ex
cept that the frozen dynamite was substi
tuted for the powder used in the first
shell. Exactly nfty-hve grammes of dyna
mite were used. At tbe signal the trigger
was Dulled. The shocfc of the firing was
extremely severe, as the gun is what is
known as a very high-powered one. The
mass of dynamite was so small, however,
that it cou.d not be estimated to what ex
tent larger masses couia resist the tiring
shock.
When the party had recovered from the
shock and pruceede i to examine the result
they lound the target pierced in the lower
left-hand corner, a short distance from the
ed^e. The shell, as in the previous in
stance, had pierced the target completely.
The point was protruding an inch beyond
the rear surface. The burr around the
hole ,was turned back enough to fully
demonstrate the power of ". the missile.
The face of the plate or target was consid
erably scarred from the pieces of shell
carried forward. Altogether it proved to
the party the absolute practicability of
the patent projectile for the purposes fn
tended.
In the third round a full serTice
cartridge of 840 grammes was used.
The initial velocity attained was cal
culated to be 1950 feet per second.
The amount of dynamite in the charge
was increased to 72.^ grammes. As
before the shell had no f use. The shock
and explosion did not vary much from the
preceding one. The shell struck the tar
get in the upper rieht-hand corner, mid
way between the center and the angle.
The point and shoulder of the shell were
lost in the backway of the target and the
plate was agiin scarred by the pieces car
ried forward.
The fourth round was a repetition of
the preceding one, except thai the shell
charge of frozen dynamite was increased
to 86 grammes. The effects were about
the same, as can be seen where the shell
struck in tne lower right-hand corner.
In the fifth round the projectile failed
10 perform its mission, but exploded just
after leaving the gun. This was due to
the fact that the dynamite had been sub
mitted to the freezing proce=s only about
half tne time of the others.
For the sixth and last round a castiron
shell was used, on account of the larger
shell chamber, allowing a greater charge
Of dynamite. This time 116 grammes were
used in the charge. There was a decidedly
good explosion following the contact witb
the plate and the target was thrown down.
The shell being of castiron, however, was
powerless against the steel plate, and only
a splash marked the spot where it struck,
somewhat more pronounced than if the
shell had been charged with powder.
This concluded the experiments, but
they were of sufficient moment to attract
the attention of military men all over the
country. A prominent army officer in
this city expressed the opinion that the
projectile would play an important part
in f .iture naval and military affairs.
"I watcued the tests witn interest," be
said, "and the satisfactory re ults ob
tained I think would warrant their being
carried out on a much larger scale. I
hope tne United States will be the first to
adopt the invention."
Mr. Bakewell has spent many years in
the study of high explosives. He has
been retained as counsel in some of the
best-known giant powder cases in this
country and in Europe.

âSelected.
This stone is a variety of quartz or rock
crystal of a tine violet Dlue or purple color.
The fine tints are caused by the presence
of manganese.
If the retl amethyst be subjected to the
influence of fire it will change from yellow
and green to colorless and in this condition
is often sold for the topaz.
Carthapena, Spain, produces the finest
specimens of the amethyst in the world.
The State of Maine in our own country
has a rich treasure-store of tnis beautiful
stone.
The sentiment of tbe primrose, i^ebr v
ary's flower, is "early youth." Its name is
from the Italian and means the first spring
flower.
Of all places in the world, it blooms
sweetest and best in "Merrie England's"
soil, and no flower is so dear to the heart
of the Englishman. Many a gifted son of
this isle has ceJeDrated it in song and
story.
The day which has been dedicated to
Lord B-^aconsneld, in England, April 19,
has come to be called "Primrose Day,*' as
it was the favorite flower of the great
statesman. Hundreds of the blossoms on
that day are used to decorate houses, mar
kets, carriages, horses ana even children.
The followers of Beaconsfield have clubs,
or societies, which they call Primrose
leagues, and have for their emblem a
bunch of the pretty yellow blossoms.
Even on the day when such quantities of
the flowers are plucked, if you should
drive out into the country, you could not
see where one blossom had been picked
from sunny field or blooming hedgerow.
Some writers call the primrose the
"ducklingof the rields," and in some parti
of England mnch superstition hovers
around this humble plant.
One of the most curious of flowers is the
night-blooming primrose. About 6 o'clock
in the eveninc it suddenly bursts open
with a popping sound, and at 6 the next
morning closes again.
When I Wag A Boy.
Children who live in the large cities
know very little about what real country
life is. They go to the public or private
schools, where everything is very com
fortable and convenient. There are so
many of these schools that very few chil
dren have to walk very far to get to any
of them. In the country, however, going
to school in winter is so serious a matter
that in some places during the winter
months the schools are closed.
When I was a boy I bad to walk two
miles to the little scboolbouse where j
first learned to read. There were several
children who lived within a short distance
of each other. We used to meet at the
crossing of two roads and then walk
through the woods together.
In spring the flowers were beginning to
bloom by the wayside, and the birds
would be singing as we passed by. In the
autumn it took us a long time to get
through those woods. 1 think the reason
will be understood when I say that there
were a great many walnut and chestnut
trees to be passed. But I was going to
tell you of something that happened to
me when I was a boy.
There was a severe snowstorm in Febru
ary, which had lasted for several days,
and the schoolbouse had been closed.
When the sun shone and the roads had
been broken, my father drove me and the
neighbors' children to school. One of the
neighbors drove us back again in the
afternoon. Of course we all had our din
ners with us as usual. I remember I
always carried mine in a little basket,
which had a red border. We were all very
much excited as we drove along slowiy.
None of us had ever seen such deep snow.
The path to the schoolhouse door was be
tween two banks of snow higher than our
heads.
At noontime, after we had eaten our
dinners, we all went out to have some
sport. I was a great jumper, and, lam
sorry to say, a great boaster.
I boasted and bragged that I could
jump from a higher place than any of the
other boys. There was a ladder which had
been left leaning against the end of the
schoolhouse. I climbed up the ladder and
said I was going to jump off. Some of the
boys waved their hats at me as I stood
there. Then I took the uimp. Down, down,
down I went into the soft, light snow. I
tried to get up, but only fell back again. I
screamed, but the snow eot into my throat
and choked my voice. I thought I never
could get out.
If I had been left alone I probably never
should have been able to do so. After
what seemed to me a long, long time I
heard a voice shouting: "I'm coming,
Tommy; I'm coming. Don't be fright
ened." It was the schoolmaster. He
pulled me out of the big drift into which
I had fallen and carried me into the
schoolroom. I had really been in the
drift but a few moments when I went
down, down, down out of sieht and did
not come up again. The other boys had
run for the master as fast as they could
go. They all beped take off my coat and
mittens and rubber boots, for I could
hardly move. I was more frightened than
hurt Indeed, I was not huriatall; but
when the master put me in his big chair
in front of the fire I felt strangely tired.
I had nev#>r felt just that way in all my
life. My head dropped over on one side
and in a moment I was fast asleep. I
slept until the neighbors came to drive us
home again.
But that snowdrift did a good thingâ it
cured me of my habit of boasting.

The Narcissus.
The narcissus is the sacred flower of the
Chinese and enters largely into their fes
tivities and religious ceremonies.
The now year holidays of this strange
people have just passed, and hundredsâ
or thousands, rather â cf the flowers of
;heir belovt d lily have bloomed during
the last few weeks.
The other day while riding through the
upper end of the quaint Oriental city
whicti lies so near the throbbing heart of
our own great modern one I saw quite a
number of the inhaDitants payly decked
in bolidÃy attire going about from one
Mouse to another, bu-ilv engaged in mat
ing New Year's calls, many of them carry
ing great bunches of the fragrant narcis
sus blossoms.
As I sped on my way, soon leaving the
sights and sounds of Chinatown far
behind, my thoughts still lingered about
the little flower; of how it had been the
theme of many a poet's song and of how
the ancient Greeks had woven around its
origin delicate mystic threads, making it
lit subject for touch of poet's pen. Then I
thought perhaps you, too, might better
enjoy the pretty lilies if you knew the
story, and so to-day I give it to you as I
learned it lone ago.
THE MYTHOLOGK AI. LSGKVS OF VASCMSOB.
Very fair and beautiful was the hunter
lad Narciistu. So perfect was lie of face
and lorm that not a day passed without
some lovely wood nymph being lured to
his side, but be cared not in the least for
their smiles, and haughtily repelled all
their advances.
So harsh was his manner to the beaute
ous nymph "Echo," who was madly in
love with him, that she faded away with
grief until naught was left but her voice.
And thus cruelly did he treat all of the
nymphs, who were ready to fall at his
feet, so wonderful was his beauty.
At last, one day a fair maiden, who had
tried in vain to attract and hold his love,
becoming desperate, uttered a prayer that
he mi.'ht some time suffer all tho pangs of
unrequited love.
This prayer was heard and soon an
swered.
In the depths of the beautiful forest
where Narcissus often pursued his favorite
chase there was a crystal stream whose
waters had never been disturbed to quench
the thirst of man or beast. Its banks were
green and moasy, and high rocks sheltered
it from the sun.
One day the cruel youth, tired after a
long hunt, came upon the silvery stream
and flung himself down beside it. As he
bent lorward to drink of its cool waters he
caught sight of his own reflection mir
rored in the clear depths.
Never before had he seen so beautiful a
beine, and thought italoveiy water sprite.
Bacfa eyes, bright as stars! Cheeks so
perfectly rounded and delicately colored !
Throat ivory white and mouth like
Cupid's bow !
The story goes, my dear, that this silly
young man right then and there fell
madly, deeply, passionately in lovo with
his own image.
From that hour no more happiness was
â Bt. Nicholas.
his. He called in vain for the sprite to
come to his longing arms.
When he tried to kiss the ruby lips the
cold, cold water came between.
When tears of despair fell from his eyes
the water was disturoed, and the beauti
ful reflection was blurred or seemed to dis
appear.
All the long, br ght days he spent gaz
ing down into his own eyes; he could not
leave the exquisite image.
But after a time all his beauty and
manly strength vanished ; the woods were
filled with his moans, and when he cried
'"Alas! alas!" the sad words were taken
up, repeated and sent back by the faithful
"Echo," who bovered ever near.
At last he died and the nymphs mourned
and grieved for the lost Narcissus.
When they jratbered by the cool stream
in the heart of the woods to do him honor,
no trace of his presence could they see.
Instead, in the very spot where he had
spent so many hours gazing at his own
reflection, grew a lovely plant, its delicate
blossoms mirrored in the waters below.
All thoughts of their own wasted affec
tions fled from their minds, and as they
inhaled the sweet fragrance of the flower,
with one accord they named it Narcissus
in honor of him whom they had so fondly
loved.
Cutting Off the Curls.
My name is Hal ! I'm awful big!
I'll be a man some day,
And 1 would never own a curl
If I could have my way.
But I hud ouce, a while ago,
A shock of golden curls,
A lot of great long shining ones,
1 looked just like the girls.
And papa said, "Yes. cut them off;
He's awful big. I know."
And mamma saidâ 'twos hard to hear;
She said it soft and lowâ
''He won't look like his own sweet self.
Mi little lair-haired boy,
His papa's own sweet darling love,
His pÂ»;t and mother's joy."
Now that is â¢ bahy talk," I know.
1 didu't .vein to hear,
For in my ninmroa'.' eye I saw
A preat big shinlne tear;
But mamma took and cut them off-
Cut every single curl.
And then 1 didn't look co much
As if I were a girl.
Then mamma took me in her arms
And rocked me in the chidr,
And then I tnid, "I'm sorry, ma,
I didn't think you'd care."
And mamma said, and held me close,
"My pet, my little one,"
While on the floor the curls all fell
And shimmered in the sun.

carefully examining the long rows of
books in the library, the child said:
"Have you got ' Jack the Giant-killer?"
And the poet was force 1 to admit that his
Horary lacked that interesting volume.
The questioner looked grieved, but said
nothing, and presently slipped down
from Longfellow's knen and trotted off.
Early the next morning the wee boy ap
peared at the poet's door, tightly clasping
in his little hands 2 cents with which bis
friend was to buy a "Jack the Giant-
Killer' for his very own !

Everybody Likes Her.
There is a a type of girl that everybody
likes. Nobody can tell exactly why, but
after you have met her you turn away to
some other woman and . c ay, "Don't you
like Miss Grosvenor?" Now the reason
you like her is a subtle one; without
knowing all about her you feel just the
sort of girl sho is.
She is the girl who appreciates the fact
that she cannot always have the first
choice of everything in the world.
She is the girl who is not aggressive and
does not find joy in inciting aggressive
people.
She is the girl who has tact enouch not
to say the very thing that will cause the
skeleton in her friend's closet to rattle his
bones.
She is the girl who, whether it is warm
or cold, clear or stormy, finds no fault
with the weather.
She is the girl who, when you invite her
to any place, compliments you by looking
her best.
She is the girl who makes this world a
pleasant place, because she is so pleasant
her-elf.
Aud, by the by, when you come to
think of it, isn't she the girl who makes
you feel she likes you and, therefore, you
like her?â Selected.

TO MY
CHRYSANTHEMUM
Beautiful chrysanthemum !
You my heart have won
As you proudly turn your face
Toward the shining sun.
When the days are damp and cold
And olher flowers have fled,
Then you bloom like "cloth of gold,"
And nod your graceful head.
When the days of autumn come
And fruits are gathered in;
When hay i? stacked for winter use
And corn is in the bin ;
When the roses and the buttercups
Have vanished like a dream,
Then your many loved companions
With glorious blossoms team.
Ah ! 'tis cheering and delightful
'Mid winter's gloom to see
A beautiful chrysanthemum
Blossoming for me.
It fills my heart with gladness
To view your colors gay,
And I wish that you might reign
Forever and a day.

Dear Editor: This is my first letter to The
Call, and I am 11 years old and go to the King
City school. I have a dog named Fido and a
cat named Tommy. My papa has taken The
Call for about a year and a hall and I enjoy
reading the children's page every Sunday. As
my letter iÂ« growing lone I will close, hoping
that it will miss the wastebaaket and appear
in print. I remain your new reader,

Cornwall, Cal., Jan. 27. 1897.
Dear Editor: I suppose you think that I have
given up writing to The Call as I hare not
written for a long time. Well, if you ao you
are very much mistaken. I have had a terri
ble attack of the grip and I am just getting
over it, so that is the reason I did not write. I
have solved some of the puzzles and will send
sorae to be solved. It has started to rain up
here to-day, and I don't like that at aIL Your
little friend, Ethel Wilds, C. R. C.

Dear Editor: lam 10 years old and in the
fourth trade. My teacher's name is Miss H.
; Martin, and she is very kind. This is my first
letter to The Call. My grandma has been
taking The Call for a long time and likes it
very well. I live in Portland, but came down
to San Francisco to make a visit. I go to the
Pacific Heights School and enjoy it. I snould
like to join the U R. C. and send a piece of ray
poetry, out I am afraid you might not think
it worth publishing. Now I think I shall
close, as my letter is getting too long. I re

Story of the Gor\ceptior\ and Execution of the J^ost Colossal Engineering Scheme
of Modern Timesâ Utilizing the Heat Imprisoned in the NoW
Dormant Volcanic PocUs of Our Western Goast
ajJSLHE present age is one of eigantic en
sl*V ter rises Measures which a faw
jItQ years ago would have challenged and
received the contumely of the incredulous
to-day are generally investigated before
the seal of approval is affixed. The "im
possible" is stricken from the lexicon and
â¢only the "improbable" remains with verj
uncertain tenure. The needs of the world
. have stimulated genius into the produc
â¢ tion of results which .hail they occurred n
hundred years ago would have condemned
their creators to (he fate of the witch. We
are no longer surprised at what happens.
The capital stock of a telephone line to
â the moon could be successfully floated in
.any city were it positively known that
"there was somebody at the distant end of
the line to answer to our "hello."
The great need of most of our large
cities arises from their desire to be
manufacturing centers; and this is unat
tainable witi; the presence of "power"
with which to revolve the wheels of ma
chinery. Where there is the fortunate
contiguity of abundant and cheap coal
supply the growth of the manfacturing in
dustries depends only upon the business
j>asacity of the citizens; but where coal is
distant and its procurement costly and
't^.cerUin the city aspiring to manufac
ficrri is sadly handicapped.
A Thus there is ever presented to the ge-
Aius of the times the solution in practical
shape of the problem of "power produc
tion" in such places. To this end natural
. gas fields have been piped to distant cen
ters of application. The enormous force
of falling water pouring over Niagara's
cataract has been harnessed to drive the
mechanism in factories, propel the cars
and- light the streets in towns and cities
very many miles from the source of power.
The stupendous character of the opera
â  tions no longer deters man in his approach

.beyond his grasp is to-day in his posses
sion, his willing slave, performing for him
' the labor which by its fruits xuakes fuller
. and more enjoyable the lives of the many.
California has not the immense torrent
â¢jof Niagara, nor nas she, as far as known,
the immense reservoirs of hydrogen gases
'which have made famous and valuable
the northern regions of New York and
Pennsylvania, but she possesses a source
of power beside which the water and the
gases of the Eastern natural power-fields
sink into pigmy insignificance.
â¢ 'From the northernmost point of North
America to the extreme end of South
America there extends a continuous range
.of mountains situated close to the western
iige of the continents. This entire range
is volcanic. Along this line, which em
â  braces the Coast Range of California, may
be found thousands of moribund craters
â¢ and volcanic vents, their salient outlines
. mostly hidden by the accumulated debris
and soils formed by the operations of
moisture and temperature during long
years. The entire country bordering the
Pacific is composed of igneous rocks,
â¢ basalts and lavas, erupted in the past from
Aue interior of the earth in molten con-
Idition. Professor Whitney, State geolo
\z\tt, n his magnificent report on "The
V jiogy of California," speaKir.g of the
hot springs, the borax deposits and the
formations of the coast regions, says:
*'There will be no difficulty in under
standing the origin of these phenomena
â¢ when we consider that they are displayed
along a line of former intense volcanic
activity and where now the igneous forces
are not entirely dormant. Even on Mount
Shasta the last expiring efforts of this
once mighty volcano may be traced in the
ejection of sulphurous vapors and steam
still going on near the summit." (Report
of 1565, page 95 et seq.)
Temperature increases as we penetrate
into the interior of the earth. It is not
germane to the purpose of this article,
which simply aims to record the concep
tion and execution of the most colossal
"engineering scheme ever undertaken, to
discuss the causes leading to such increase
of temperature; it i* sufficient to say that
it is a fact. In the mines of the grest
"Comstock lode the rate of increase of tem
perature has been estimated to be one de
gree of Fahrenheit for every forty-five feet
of descent until a depth of 20C0 feet is
reached; and below that, as much as one
degree for every twenty-nve feet of addi
tional depth below tne surface. Assum
ing that this regular increase of tempera
ture continues, a simple calculation proves
to us that at a depth of say 7000 or 8000
feet a temperature of 212 degrees Fahren
heit will be found, one sufficient to boil
water at the earth's surface; and at a
depth of about twenty miles the tempera
ture will be high enough to melt cast
iron. In other parts of the world this in
crease of temperature, as the earth's crust
5s penetrated, is found to obtain, though
with less rapid increase than is marked on
the western coast of America. 8o well es
tablished Is this fact that it has been seri-

practical engineers to make very deep

water may be obtained for heating pur
poses. Arrago and Wolferdin. two emi
nent physicists, suggested this method for
the j urpose of warming the Jardin acs
Flumes in Paris.
The lack at that time of proper mechani
cal appliances deterred the enterprise.
! Now that such important improvements
have been made in carrying borings to
enormous depths tha time is at hand when
we may draw upon the supply of subter
ranean heat. The city of Budapest is
now extensively supplied with hot water
from underground sources.
It must be known that this rule of in
creased temperature applies to the earth's
crust considered as a level coinciding
with the surface of the sea. In the vol
cano the subterranean heat is projected
far above the line of sea level. To reach a
region of desired high temperatur* In a
volcanic region it is not necessary to bore
deeply into the bowels of the earth. A
horizontal shaft piercing the vent of the
volcano above sea level will reach the in
candescent material in a more direct an.l
shorter route than a vertical one. Recog
nizing the great need of a.loquate heat â
for, after all, heat is the basis of mechani
cal power, whether it be in the shape of
coal, gas or even water force, it H simply
the determination of how many units of a
"mode of motion " that are obtainable
that solves the problem of all manufac
turing industriesâ recognizing this prime
fact, the scheme has bÂ«en bad under con
sideration for along time by prominent
promoters of industrial enterprises of
utilizing, if possible, the heat imprisoned
in the now dormant volcanic rocks of our
Western coast. For if it can be made
available the greatness of Ibe Pacific CoaM
is assured. The market for whatever
manufactured products she may create is
and has been waiting, and it is an im
mense market and a growing one.
To this end, quietly, but systematically,
investigations have been going on by
thoroughly competent men of well-known
engineering and scientific ability, who
have just concluded their labors and made
their report, which ie now in the hands of
the executive committee of a syndicate
formed of Eastern and English capitalists,
fully able to deal promptly and compe
tently with any undertaking involving
the expenditure of hundreds of millions.
The report states that at numerous
places along the line of volcanic fracture
and upheaval, known as the "Coast
Range," a temperature of lrom 200 to 300
degrees (Fahrenheit) may be reached by
means of a horizontal tunnel or drift con
structed above sea level ; the elevation of
the cutting or boring above sea level vary
ing with the locality. As, for instance,
the temperature mentioned may be found
at the termination of a boring projected
into the side of Mount Shasta at an eleva
tion of 8000 feet, while the same tempera
ture would have to be sought for at lower
levels elsewhere. It is not meant by this
that molten material or even incan
descence would be found in such cases, but
that the boring would reach an interior
region having the temperature men
tioned.
For reasons that will be well understood
these borings will be conducted at levels
uot greatly elevated above sea level. Id
the case of a huge mountain, as Mount
Shasta, the outlet of the fiery material at
the time of its ejection was through a
central dike or funnel, the enormous
amount of matter ejected having in time
largely formed the mass of the aides of
the mountain. To attempt to reach the
hot interior funnel would, therefore, en
tail the necessity of an extremely long
tunnel. The object to be attained â the
presence of heat â may be had by means
of much shorter tunnels projected into
lower volcanic formations having thinner
walls. This latter condition is the one
recommended by the report.
The report is accompanied with elabo
rate geological and physical maps of the
regions Inspected, and also by numerous
drawings showing in sectional elevation
the various localities which are available
to the purposes.
The practical application of the scheme
comprehends the cutting of tunnels ol
working dimensions into tbe Hides of cer
tain mountains in the Coast Range; the
tunnels will vary from one to three miles
in length, or until the temperature sought
for is reached. In the tunnels will be
placed a system of pipes leading from the
mouth of tbe cutting to its interior end.
In the furthest end of tbe tunnel will be
placed what mfght be termed boilers; only
they will contain no water, simply air.
These boilers will be made of cast iron, of
peculiar construction, so that any num
ber of them may be connected together, to
form one "battery." A portion of the
pipes leading to the "boilerÃ" will carry
cold air, and another portion convey the
heated air from the "boilers" to the en
gines. Within the tunnels, removed at
suitable distance from the hot end, will be
placed hot-air engine*, using tbe ex

heat, and contracts with cold. The object
of locating the engines close to the "boil
ers" is to mnke the greatest possible use of
the power of the expanded air. The en

also compressed air, which will be trans
mitted to desirel points.
1 have briefly outlined the salient points
of this gigantic scheme, which to many
may sound as if bodily taken from the
romancing of Jules Verne, but it is in fact
a genuine project, planned by shrewd, far
seeing men, investigated and approved by
known practical physicists and engineers,
and backed by very largo and cautious
capital. Certain details have yet to be
arranged before the matter can be made
public in the sense of incorporating and
exploitation. A scheme of such colossal
proportions and involving the investment
of millions of capital calls for careful
cons deration of every feature. Legal
advice is absolutely necessary to provide
against future annoyance in the determin
ation of property rijcuts, and it has been
determined by the syndicate to obtain
from the Legislature of the State proper
authority to carry into execution the great
plan. It i- understood that a bill, now
prepared, will be introduced at the present
session of the Legislature, conferring upon
the syndicate the necessary rights and
authority. Wnen this is done, the pre
liminary borings will be begun. The value

Is Gibraltar Useless ?
An article of exceptional interest â evi
dently written by a Spanish military of
ficer â appears In the current number of
the "Memorial de Artilleria," showing
that the extended range of modern artil
lery has completely revolutionized the
conditions which have hitherto enabled
Gibraltar to protect its own arsenal and
dockyard and to afford safety for vessels
at anchor under the guns of the fortress.
When Gibraltar was taken by the Eng
lish Is 1704 the greatest range for artillery
lire was onJy about 3000 yards, so that a
fleet under the batteries of Gibraltar was
secure against attack from the Spanish
coast.
It is now pointed out that with a com
paratively small expenditure of money by
the Spanish Government batteries con
structed in (he bay of Al<;eciras, upon the
ri.life of mountains known as the Queen
of Spain's Chair, woulrt actually command
Gibraltar at a distance of 1)000 yards and
would De capableof demolishing the whole
length of the fortifications from the Gal
leries to Europa Point. These Spanish
batteries would also threaten the entry of
ships oi war to Moles. This plan would
merely involve the mounting of some
forty heavy guns of from 4.7-inch to
12-inch caliber and a similar number of
howitzers.
At the present moment the strategical
points on this part of the Spanish coast
are entirely unfortified, and with Spain's
present embarrassments in Cuba and the
Philippines it is not likely, as the "Broad
Arrow" points out, that the Madrid Gov
ernment will take immediate action in
tbe matter. But that these batteries may
be constructed some day or other is far
from improbable, and in view of the great
importance to England of Gibraltar as a
naval base, and the renewed expenditure

PJJSIHE latest society fad which promises

that have found work for idle brains to do
is that of character-reading by the eyes.
The fact that tho eye is "the window of the
soul" woc.ld make it seem probable that
by its light we may distinguish the Inner
mind and possibly make a guesÃ at the
interior decoration of tiie palace of
thought.
Like other windows, especially those of
cathedrals, the eye is of various colors
and consequently the views obtained
through it are tinged by Its hues. A blue
eye shows the mind in a different light
from that given by a black, hazel or brown
one. and a part, ol the opticist's art is to
differentiate and to decide on the meaning
of ibe various tints obtained through this
medium.
According to L.avater and others who
have made a study of physiognomy the
color of the eye is the key to the character.
A hazel-eyed woman, we are tola, never
elopes from her husband, never chats
scandal, prefers his comfort to her own,
never talks too much or too little, always
is an intellectual, agreeable and lovely
creature.
The gray is the sign of shrewdness and
talent. Great thinkers and captains have
it. In women it indicates a better head
than heart Gray eyes are of many varie
ties. There are the sharp, the shrewish,
the spiteful, the cold and the wild gray
eye, but the fact remains that the gray
represents the head.
There la one variety of gray eye of
which every lover should beware, the soft
eye with a large pupil that contracts and
dilates with a word, a thought or a flash
ot-leeling. An eye that laughs, that sighs
almost, that has its sunshine, its twilight,
its moonbeams and its storms. A wonder
ful eye that wins you whether you will or
not, and holds you after it has cast you

the subject is beginning to attract the
serious attention of naval and military
authorities. â New York Herald.
Bees, according to a statistician, must,
in order to collect a pound of clover
honey, deprive 62,000 clover blossoms of
their nectar. To do this, the 62,000 flowers
must be visited by an aggregate of
3,750,000 bees; or, in other words, to col
lect hi 3 pound of honey one bee must
make 3,750,000 trips from and to the hive.
As bees are known to fly for miles in quest
of suitable fields of operation, it is clear
that a single ounce of honey represents
millions of miles of travel.

not. No matter if features are irregular
and complexion varying, the eye holds

Black eyes of course are typical of fire,
heroism and firmness, and have a spice of
diabolism in tbeir rays that has a potent

Width of the lower eyelid is believed to
indicate a disposition to extenuate and to
justify one's self, to defend conduct by
giving cool reasons for It, When this
lower lid curves downward and shows the
white below the pupil, then, oh then,
pause and Hesitate to trust your welfare to
the owner of that eye. If opticists are
right it is an indication of profound, cal
culating selfishness. John D. Rockefeller
has such an eye in a recent cartoon. Per
haps this proves the truth of the assertion.
Eyebrows may be thick or thin, fine or
coarse, smooth or busby, arched or
straight, regular or irregular, and each
iorra and quality has its special signifi
cance in reference to temperament and
character.
Thick, strong eyebrows generally betray
a fall development of temperament. When
also coarse, bushy and irregular we may
expect harshness of character. Thin,
fine, delicate eyebrows are indicative of a
fine-grained organization and an active, if
not predominant, temperament.
The art of the opticist needs no studio
nor cabinet in which to practice. The
eyes can be examined in public as well as
in private.
To Arrest Torpedoes
ft Huge Steel SKield Extending From BoW
to Stern and From j(eel to Water
Line, Is the First Effective De
fense for Battle-Ships
Â§ONDON, Feb. 6.â A vast amount of
attention has been attracted recently
in admiralty circles to a new device
for the protection of big battle-ships
below the water line.
The new mode of hull defense is the
idea of Dr. Herbert Jones, a naval con
structor of note, and is designed to act as
a torpedo-guard for the vessel below the
surface of the sea. It has met with such
universal favor among naval architects
and marine engineers that the Govern
ment of Great Britain is seriously con
sidering its adoption.
The plan of Dr. Jones is simply to place
a huge steel shield along the hull of the
battle-ship on both sides. It will consist
of a number of large plates in juxtaposi
tion, extending from stem to stern, and
from the keel to a point just above the
water line. The plates must fit exactly to
the model of the hull so as not to retard
the speed of the vessel when there is no
occasion to use them.
Even those who are unfamiliar with
naval construction must know that the
most vulnerable part of a ship is that of
Vier hull below the water line. There are
located the very vitals of the marine
monster â the boilers, engines, magazines
and furnaces. On each of these the life,
power and movement of the vessel de
pends. One shot, or even 100, or even
1000 shots might pass through the upper
parts of a battle-ship without destroying
or even seriously disabling her, but let
one torpedo pierce the comparatively thin
body in the weak spot under the water
and the chan ;es are a thousand to one
against her remaining afloat long after
that.
The millions of pounds sterling expended
by the great powers of the world on the
offensive and defensive merits of guns ver
sus armor has brought them no nearer to
a solution as to the superiority in the one
c ise or the other than they were thirty
years ago, and for many years past the idea
oi one ship destroying another by stand
ing off and exchanging shots from a dis
tance nas been recognized as an absolute
impossibility.
Lord Armstrong on this point has well
stated that these stupendous warships
"cannot be made invulnerable," and that
their cost is so enormous that no country
can have a numerous navy of such ves
sels.
While the great naval powers are busily
engaged in bringing submarine warfare to
a perfect system of attack by means of div
ing torpedo-boats British naval authori
ties agree that England has apparently
neglected the means of resisting marine
uttack. There are, for instance, torpedo
boats, torpedo - boat catchers and tor
pedo-boat destroyers, and it is an admitted
fact that the so-called catchers are In
ferior in speed to the boats they are sup
posed to catch ; and as to the destroyers,
their special destructive powers ara not
very apparent.
In a fair aboveboard sea flcght between
the types mentioned and first and second
class battle-ships it is a question with na
val experts which would destroy or be de
stroyed. The greatest dancer to battle-ships
would be at night when the destroyers,
owing to their speed and handiness
might get a torpedo in contact with the
enemy's side, when the battle-ship, devoid
of under-water protection, would inevita
bly be destroyed. Hence, declares a lead*
ing naval officer, "the term destroyer in
its fullest and truest sense is only applica
ble to the modern diving torpedo-boat.
As sure as one of these submarine ship-de
stroyers, in a state of suspension at a reg
lated depth below the surface of the
water, is navigated to within striking dis
tance of a 15,000-ton battle-ship bo surely
will the ponderous battle-ship be destroyed
immediately on being struck by a missile
aimed by her unseen submarine foe.
There is no give and take about this what
ever, as the submarine torpedo-boat when
deeply immersed is out of reach of its op
ponent, while at the same time it strises
at the most vital and unprotected part of
| tne nuil of the monster floating above it."
It is upon this very point that the ma
rine architects and engineers of the world
have been puzzling their brains for years.
That is, they have taxed their inventive
powers to the utmost to devise a form of
protection against the scientific advance of
submarine warfare. The only contrivance
now in use to protect the lower portion of
a ship's hull from torpedo attacs is a huge
netting of wire slung from booms on the
side of the ship and supposed to pene
trate far enough beneath the surface of
the water to furnish protection for the
entire bottom. This apparatus affords
protection to some extent when the vessel
has hove to, but when she lias speed on
the net is sure to drag astern and expose
a large surface of ttie hull. Then again
torpedoes have been invented for the very
purpose of cutting through the netting
when it is found as an obstacle.
With Dr. Jones' new device, the torpedo
could not reach the hall proper bat would
explode itself against the preventive hull,
as the guard might be termed. That of
course would be demolished, but the hull
itself would be saved from destruction.
As previously stated, the shield must fit
snugly to the hull. The shield consists of
a number of wide piates placed side by
side and hung by hinges on a long rod
running the length of the ship, just above
the water line, and extending to the keel.
Above each plate is a davit securely at
tached to the ship's side. A tackle is
suspended from each davit, and the lower
block hooks into a ring bolt in the lower
end of the plate. The falls run into the
hull and connect with a windlass, so that
the guard can be hoisted out by steam.
When placed in position for defense it
must be hauled outboard about twenty
feet from the hull. Thus, besides the re
sistance of the shield, a huge cushion of
water which has been formed aids in the
protection of the ship.
Captain 8. Eardley Wilmot, K. N M latÂ«
chief torpedo expert of the Admiralty, in
his report has the following to say on the
subject:
"The development of the 'Whitehead 1
torpedo, with which now nearly ail na
tions are supplied, renders the question
of protecting ships against this attack one
of the gravest consideration.
"The torpedo of to-day travels at the
rate of 30 knots an hoar and carries 200
pounds of explosive compound directed
against the most vulnerable part of a ship,
that of her hull under water.
"We hare been enabled by the addition
of large masses of armor to fairly pro
tect the water line and above it against
the effects of artillery fire, bat cannot ex
tend this to the submerged portion of her
hull as a defense against torpedo attacks.
We have therefore been obliged to restrict
oar endeavors as far as structural ar
rangements are concerned to give ships of
war a double bottom, and subdividing
them internally into a number of water
tight compartments, thus seeking to
diminish the effects of an explosion and
restrict the inflow of water at that point.
"As, however, these arrangements could
only give very partial protection at a
time when torpedoes carried a compara
tively small charge, it was considered de
sirable to stop them before they could
reach the ship and for this purpose the
present system of net defense was de
vised.
"This consists of wire nettine suspended
vertically from steel or wooden booms at
tached to the hull of the ship, from which
they project from 25 to 35 feet. The nets
hang down to a depth of 20 feet and ara
connected together in sections so as to
then form a continuous crinoline of net-
ting.
"But should the ship move through the
water, the nets are more or less impelled
toward the surface according to the speed
of the ship. For these reasons naval offi
cers do not consider that nets can be used*
at sea.
"Thus It is evident that if external pro*
tection is to be relied upon it must be in a
different form, ana Dr. Jones has devised
a torpedo-guard which is not only novel,
but free from most of the objections in
herent to the net defense. His plan is to
have steel shields made to the form of ths
ship and ordinarily resting against the
hull. They are, however, capable of being
projected outward when required to a dis
tance of twenty fast from the hull, and
this cushion of water, together with the
resistance offered by the steel plating,
should secure a ship from material injury
in the event of a torpedo exploding
against the guard. It is obvious that the
plate could not be cut through like a net,
nor would it be forced out ot position by a
current or the ship's moving through the
water.
"An advantage of this system is that all
the appliances for working this protection
are above the water line and always in
position, thus enabling the protection to
be pat in position at the shortest notice,
while it overcomes the difficulty attached
to supporting steel booms or rams if pro
jected to a distance of twenty or thirty
feet.
"Thi3 plan now proposed by Dr. Jonei
is, in my opinion, the best which lias been
put forward for guarding against the terri
ble effects of locomotive torpedo attack,
and looking to the grave issues involved I
consider that expenditure would be wisely
incurred in giving it a trial."
Many others have signified their ap
proval of Dr. Jones' torpedo defense for
protecting costly warships and the lives of
gallant seamen from the appalling dan
gers of torpedo attack, among whom are
the highest expert authorities of the
United Kingdom. In the front rank of
these is Â£. J. Reed, X.C.8., weli known
as having designed and constructed war
ships for all the naval powers of the world.
The accompanying illustration shows
one of Dr. Jones' modes of protection
against torpedo attack. It gives a fore
shortened view taken off the port bow and
represents the vessel with the improved
torpedo guard expanded to its protective
position while the dreaded missile ex
plodes against it.

lM/Mj^ ten San Francisco will be
pomlly set down .-is the town that
Ilelene Modjeska Loved bÂ«\M. It was San
Francisco tbnt first recognised her talent,
and when, after nearly twenty years of
triumphs, the great no tress; enfeebled by
a long and wearing illness, wants to try
her pinions again, it is to San Francisco
that she conies as to an old friend. And
what an ovation awaited her! They say
the American public is fickle and loves
favorites, but did the reception on Mod
jeskft's opening night â the reception that
made her shed tearsâ look like fickleness?
The actress was feeble and worn and
timid on that opening night, as if stie
doubted herself and her powers, and,
moreover, she had cho en to appear in
"Magda," a nart which is not her best.
But as the week went on and the public
continued to rally round her Modjeoka
gained courage, ami on the last night of
the first week she shone forth with all her
old glory in "Marie Stuart." Since then
there has l>een no donbt ahont the bucc- as
of the Modjeska season. The Polish act
ress has shown once a -am that her great
est roles are tho.'-e calling for pathos,
dicnlty and tenderness, such as Mane
Stuart ami Adrienne. She is cast, both
nu-ntaltv and physically, in too fragile
and delicate a moid to make a convincing
Ma^d a or a great Lady Macbeth, but ncr
reading of both parts is full of interest for
students of the drama.
The star's supporting company "did
itself proud," considering that, with the
exception of Haworth, it was made up of
beginners and actors of local fame. Lon
ergan made the best record, for out of four
important parts he interpreted three with
skill. These three were the rector in
"Magda," Macduff, and the Earl of Leices
ter in "Marie Stuart," Hi-. Marshal Suxe
in "Adrienne Lecouvreur" was hampered
by the Queen Anne costume. Lonergan
did not know how to wear that trying
garb; few actors do. They rcay look like
emperors when they wear togao, they may
win the devotion of matinee girls in Eliza
bethan costume, and they may be mis
taken for belted earls in the dress of to-day,
but nine-tenth* of them shrink into utter
insignificance when they are put into the
costume that prevailed at the beginning
of the last century. It is one of the pret
tiest style* ot dress in the wardrobe ot his
tory, but for a man to wettr it gracefully
seems to be a lost art.
In "Adrienne" Lonergan gave me the
uncomiorabl- impression that his Mar
shal SÂ«Â«xe costume was too tight. He wore
red boots, a red coat and a face to matco
and every movement seemed to be
achieved at the eminent danger of break
ing nomet!)iiiir. Stevens, who was manly
and heroic in "Macbeth," wrestled with
the difficulties of his "Louis XIV" costume
even less successfully man Lonergan. It
princes at the court of La Grand Monarch
looked and walked and talked like that,
Voltain 's pen must have been culded by a
more roseate imagination than the nine
teenth oeutury society editor's.
Qftorse Oabourue had two opportunities
during the seasou, and made something
of one of them â the role of the old Re
gisseur in "Adrienne LÂ°couvreur." His
Chandllor it: "M.-tgda" was not a happy
effort. Mr. Osbourne did not seem to have
any mental gia*pof the requirements of
t tie role. On the opening night he played
tlie Chancilloras a "solo' character study,
without regard to its bearings on the other
characters in the play; later in th? week a
change came o'er the spirit of Mr. Os
l ourne's dream, and he made the Chancil
lor less bourgeois and banal, which was a
distinct gain to "Maeda" as a whole.
The Regisseur in "Adrienne" is one of
the richest, juiciest parts for the portrayer
of elderly roles in the whole range of
standard drama. It gives unlimited scope
for the exquisite touches of tenderness,
pathos and truth to nature, which are the
highest productof French art. and though
O^bourne was far from playing the Re-Ms
seur with the finish of a Coquelin, he suc
ceeded in giving a stikingiy honest and
sincere rendering of the role. The way in
which the house broke into applause when
he stood at the wings and clapped the
imaginary performance at the Cnmedie
Francaise showed how he swayed his
audience.

struggle between Gustav Waiter and the
popular vaudeville taste in music. Mr.
Walter longs to be a musical missionary â
h" has not confided the fact to me, but
"By their fruits ye shall know them,"
and Walter's visit east has borne fruits in
musical "turns" that soar above the cafe
chantant style. Vaudeville audiences
proverbially do not want natural voices,
bel canto, or such musical nonsense a*
virtuosity of any sort. What they want
is something freakish and cute; if it is
seasoned with a dash of &ui;gestiveness
so much the more attractive. As for a
singer who can sing, a vaudeville audience
is not supposed to have any use for him,
and phrasing, correct intonation, musical
expression, ami other trifles of the kind
would be repudiated by most vaudeville
anists with an eye to business. The sort
of piima donna that a music hall
audience wants is a dashing young person
in abbreviated skins, with voluminous
chiffon lingerie, whochortles, more or less
true to the key, about the advisability of
keeping the grass green on Willies
grave, or tells, in grating tones, that
"Mother Was a Lady"â a statement, by
the way, which it requires a good healthy
imagination to swallow, judging from the
appearance and behavior of the daughter.
If mother was a lady, what would she
have said to the abbreviated skirts and
the chiffon lingerie?
It is a mystery to me why people who
are always severely critical when they goto
grand opera or symphony concerts invari
ably clap their hands and stamp their
feet with delight at a vaudeville show,
when Miss Triptoes chortles about her
mother being a lady, a full half-semitone

Bertha Foltz's Success.
A clever young actress who made her
appearance last ..week with the Alcazar
Company is Miss Bertha Foltz, who at a
short notice assumed the part of Olive
Grey in "A Lsgal Wreck," owing to the
sudden illness of Miss Buckley. Miss
Foltz surprised every one by tbe manner
in which she played the part, for it was
not only a long one, but also one that
called for careful study in its rendition.
The clever young lady received a warm
welcome from the audience and was
heartily congratulated by ihe managers
anil her associates. Miss Foiiz is the
daughter of the well-known lady lawyer,
Clara Foltz, and is a niece of Charles M.
Ehorindge of The Call, and of Samuel
Sbortridge, the attorney. B he was born
in Dcs Moines, low i, and is just 20 years
old. She was educated in tbe Hanna Col
lege in Los Angeles, and went upon the
stage live years ago.
She made her debut with Grismer and
Davies, in "Chispa." at the A!cazar The
ater, playing the part of Florence Mont
calm. When Stockwell opened the tne
ater which bore his name, Mi>s Foltz was
a valuable member of the company, and
appeared in every play presented for
nearly a year. She went on the road with
Clay Clement, in "The New Dominion,"
orij,Muatii.E the part of Fiora May Ran
dolph, and received the nearty commen
dation of the en lire presi in the East.
â¢Miss Foltz is petite in figure, with light
eolden hair ana a pair ol sparciing biue
eyes which are an index to the capabili
ties she posse s'---. She is destined to win
an enviable place in her profession, for
she has abilities of a high order. In "The

THE POLE CAN BE EEACHED.
Peary'a Project Prononnced Thoroughly
It:ic( i<:ibi .
No writer of authority on the polor re
gions will dispute the soundness of Mr,
Peary's plan for reaching the north pole.
His scheme couid not have been devised
until now wiih any assurance that it was
the best But we know at last that 1119
essential land basis for an attack upon the
polar problem cannot be found on the
Asian side. We know that the archipelago
which Peary saw stretching away to the
north of Greenland is in all probability by
far the nearest land approach to the pole.
It is certainly the only land approach ac
cessible by navigabie Eeas and a known
coast line.
It is not enough to say that the West
Greenland route best fulfills the desired
conditions. We now know that it is the
only route that comes anything near ful
tilling them. It is the route to the pole, a
route that is impossible at times, difficult
in some years, and wholly practicable in
others. The man who follows it to the
northern apex must be on the ground with
his equipment, and there await, if need be,
a favorable season ; and it is the only route
because it otters a land base thai is nearest
tbe pole, where supplies tuay be laid down
by ship and then advanced by sledge to
the most northern Jand, whence a dash
may be made across the ice to the pole
when the first favorable season comes.
Suppose we had known all ihis in the
days when Nares' Alert lay off the shore
of the Polar Sea, or Lockwood and Brain
ard struggled to their highest nonh.
There is little likelihood that they, even
with this knowledge, could have reached
the pole. The methods of living and
working in the Arctic regions have been
pimply revolutionized since their time.
The new ideas are those that made po-si
ble the brilliant success of Peary's siedge
journey, and of Nansen's ice march and
winter camp; and these ideas, approved
as they now are by Arctic authorities,
were chiefly originated by Civil Engineer
Peary, and he was the pioneer who nrst
tested them in practice.
Paary maintained before he started for
North Greenland in 1891 that explorers
who should achieve most in Arctic regions
would be those wh<> mastered the art, per
fected by the Eskimos, ol working and
thrving amid their environment; and
during his three years amone those Arctic
highlanders he learned all the lessons
they could teach. He wore the skins and
furs they had found a lapted for each sea
son, and they made bis garments. He
drove his degs after their fashion, and
their ideas helped him to model his
sledges. He soent many a night in their
huts, and they were his comrades on the
hum, on numerous journeys and for
scores of miles on the inland ice. He
learned thoroughly to know them and
their ways; he was their friend and they
bis helpmeets; and to-day he is the only
explorer who, landing in North Green
anu, could from the first hour avail him
self of every advantage that native meth
ods and co-operation can give.
Tbe brilliant work of Peary and Nansen
has c tablished the fact to the satisfaction
of all experts that tbe pole can be reached,
and pointed out the route and the
methods. There is not a particle of doubt
now that this long eiusive object will be
attained. We do not know who will set
himself this task; but if the north pole is
to be reached in our day the man who is
btÂ»st equipped for the work, bes qualified
by experience to take advantage of every
favoring circumstance, is the American
Peary, who received on last Tuesday ni?ht
the highest honor tbe American Geo
graphical Society could confer upon a
great explorer. â New York Sun.

"THE BLACK CAT " UP TO DATE
He Is a MarVelously Successful Hunter
ar\d J-Jis Exploits /ire the Wonder ar\d
Pride of an Extensile Region
M^ERE is a black cat with an actual
â pJl^ hunting record which is unequaled
â¢l^Y*^ by any hunter in Rockland County,
Vermont.
Minks, woodchucks, rabbits and part
ridges are tne game which he prefer?. lie
scorns with lofty disdain to hide behind a
brush or tree and pounce out upon some
tiny chipmunk or small bird. He is a true
hunter, with all the instincts of a sports
man and for versatility is a modern "puss
in boots."
Nimrod is the very appropriate name of
this bunting cat, and he is owned by Miss
Nina Cook of Poultney, which is situated
on the shores of Lake St. Catherine, in the
Green Mountain State. This remarkable
feline is also addicted to the more gentle
art of angling as weli as the excitement of
wood sports and tne chase. And it is no
uncommon thing for him to land a perch,
pickerel or an occasional bass weighing
three or four pounds.
In addition to his prowess in the cbase
this wonderful cat has social qualities that
make him an acquisition to any house
hold. He accompanies the families to the
neighbors' houses and behaves prettily as
a visitor, never scratching the children
nor quarreling with tiie dogs. He has
his special chair at the dinner table and
waits to be helped as the other guests,
asking a blessing with a contented purr
of thankiulness and then lapping his
milk or nibbling his chicken as daintily
aB a young lady at a ball supper.
Notwithstanding his sanguinary achieve-
Znents in the banting field his fur is
always spotlessly clean and his nails
deftly manicure:, and no one would ever
imagine that they had ever been buried in
a rat's vitals or had scratched the slimy
skin of a snake.
His whiskers especially are trained like
those of a Parisian gentleman of fasnion,
and while they can bristle fiercely in a
tight, can also curl coquettishly when
greeting friends or welcoming good-look
ing strangers whoÃe apuearance may
cr.ance to please his fickle fancy.
il;s peculiar "miaow" is multiphonic
and would almost persuade the hearer
that the cat has a language of his own,
articuiar ana ruonetic. In fact, the fam
ily has arrived at the understanding ot its
var;ed inflections so as to comprehend
perfectly what the :>.nimal wants and
wishes, and the cat in return comprehends
every word that is spoken in his pres
ence, be it English or French, both of
which tongues are of common U3e in the
household.
Nimrod apparently hunts and fishes for
two reasons. In the first piece, he seems
to enjoy the exitement of the chase and
the battle to the death which invariably
follows, with the c&f. a victor. Iv the sec
ond place, he apparently feels that lor
some reason he is expected to make fre
quent additions to the family larder, and
so far as is known he never attempts to
eat the game which he catches, but in
variably brings it home to his mistress
and lays it at her feet.
When the game is prepared for the
table, he enjoys his portion of it with the
rest of the family. His hunting record
for the present season has been one of
which a human hunter armed with the
most complete and modern sporting arms
might be more than proud.
He has caught, killed and brought
home, one woodchuck, one American
marten, one muskrat, five minks, several
weasels, eighteen gray squirrels and
ground squirrels, 173 rabbits, fifteen par
tridges and a big black snake.
With all those to his credit as a sport
ing feline, Nimrod has found time to fre
quently go fishing, catch a big owl and
keeps the promises of the family froe
from rats. Upon an unlucky occasion,
Nimrod himself got caught and came
limping home witu his fore foot fast in
the cruel jaws of a small steel trap.
The sharp steel had cut through the fur
and flesh to the bone, but the cat went at
once to his mistress and seemed to under
stand that release and the dressing of the
wound would be painful, for all through
the operation of washing, dressing and
binding up of the hurt he lay on a lounge
and made no move until the uncomforta.
ble process was completed.
In appearance he is a big black animal
with long silken fur, with only one tiny
white spot ou his body, that being on the
right side of his neck. He generally pre
fers to hunt alone, but between Nimrod
and Sport, the family dog, there is a
strong friendship. They eat out of the
same disli ana sometimes go on hunting
trips together. From one of these trips
they came borne late at night, Nimrod
with a black snake and a plump young
partridge in his mouth, while Sport car
ried an old partridge.
They deposited their spoils at the feet of
Miss Cook, and Nimrod seemed quite put
out when the snake was not put into the
pot and boil i>d with the partridge. He
seemed, however, to raaiise that snakes
are not popular as an arvicle either ol com
merce or diet, and pinc2 thtn has uever
brought any more home.
Another peculiar feature of Nimrod's
hunting is that the game be brings to his
mistress 13 of the very best. No manpy j
mint whose fur would not bave a market |
value does he ever bring in to lay at his
mistress' feet; no unt'eatiiered fowl will he
soil his jaws with. All must be clean,
wnolesome and plump or puss will have
none of it, and in that proiitic part of .the
country, the "fersnnatuno" being plentiful ;
as yet, Puss can afford to be particular and
ditlicult to pleaae.
It is no matter of surprise to Miss Cook
or any of her household to lind a dead
rabbit or bird lying about the house. In
fact, she would not wonder if puss should
one day bring in a fox thrice as big as
himself, slung over his bacic. But minks,
squirrels and otiier game, whose fur is of
value, are never scattered about thus care
lessly, but are always carefully laid down
at thf feet of his owner, and the customary
word oi approval waited for and received
with a soft purr of satisfaction.
Living as he dots on the shores of Lake
St Catherine, Nimrod has ample oppor
tunity to practice the piscatorial art, his
favorite fi^hin^ ground b'-ing the trunk of
a fallen tree, whish overhangs a deep pool
in the lake.
Here, when there is no ice to interfere
with his work, Nimrod lies like a black
panther, extended at full length along the
tree-trunk. When a fi.-h which suits him
comes near the surface beneath tne tree,
down goes a sleek blacK paw and the
sharp claws are buried in ttie side of % the
tish. There is no escape for the "finny
one," and cat takes his catch home in
triumph.
The hardest battle which Nimrod has
yet had was with a woodchuck, which
refused to be killed without a tough fight.
Nimrod was game, however, and after
receiving some severe bites and scratches
he managed to get a good "backhola" on
the woodchuck and by a quick turn to
break his neck.
The skins of the animals which Nimrod
has brought Some have when gold added
not a little to the "'pin money" of his
mistress, while as a provider of "game in
season" for the table Nimrod has no equal
in all the country.
Of course puss is one of the lions of tne
countryside. Every traveler is told of his
exploits and if possible brought to see the
hero of them. All such visits are received
calmly and with dignity. Puss evidently
realizes his position as the champion
hunter of the county and looks npon the
homage paid as merely public recognition
of a self-evident fact needing no com
ment.
It is now proposed by the hunters of the
county to present puss with a silver cham
pion's belt or rather collar, which will no
doubt be worn with pride and repaid with
double exertion on the part of the grate
ful recipient, for Nimrod is no churl and
would scorn to accept undeserved favors.
That the cat manages to catch such shy
birds as partridges and such fleet-footed
animals as rabbits is a matter of much
comment among those who are personally
familiar with its prowess in the field.
As a "stalker" Nimrod is a brilliant
success, but he has been seen in the early
morning hours scurrying across the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1897.
stubble fields, in close pursuit of a fright
ened rabbit which was fleeing for life.
The success of the chase is, however, al
ways apparent when the feline hunter
comes proudly home and lays his long
eared prey before his mistress.
The ancient Egyptians appreciated the
cat as a Household penius so highly that
they deified, or at least "beatified," it in
their sacred calendar, and its mummy is
found entombed along with those of
J'lniraohs and high priests.
The Aryan legend, "The Cat of Knowl-
edge," which has come down to our times
and climes as "Puss in Boots,'' is evidence
of the estimation in which the animal
was held on the Himalayan plateau,
whence our race descended to cover the
earth with knowledge, while in modern
times the well-known tale of "Whitting
ton and His Cat" sustains the reputation
for energy and dash that the feline race
has obtained wherever it has dwelt.
The good people of Rockland County
have much the same regard for Nimrod
that the ancient Egyptian had for his cat,
and any offer of sale would be declined
and regarded as nothing sbort of sacri
lege. His exploits are looked upon as re
flecting great credit upon the folk of the
countryside, and any serious mishap to
this most remarkable cat would be re
garded as a most dire calamity.
POODS VERY IMPURE.
Evaporated Cream, Milk, Honey and
Syrup I .nllv Adulterated.
Professor W. T. Wenzell, chemist of the
Board of Health, has submitted his
monthly report of the chemical depart
ment concerning the analysis of food
products durinj: the month of January.
He makes the following interesting state
ments:
The so-called evaporated creams consist
of milk from which a notable quantity of
butter fai had been abstracted and is then
condensed by the evaporation of more or
less of its water. The so-called condensed
milk may be detined as milk from which a
portion of the butter fat has been removed
and thickened with cream sugar. The
analyses of certain samples were given in
detail, and the following conclusions are
drawn:
"It will be Been that the above samples
are not creams; that they are simply
milks, very poor in batter fat, and con
densed, excepting Nos. 29 and 40, which
are made from a good quality of milk.
liut, as they represent milk only in
creased to represent two parts condensed
to one art their nutriment quality is be
low that of the others."
To show the great variability of the
preparations, a table is given showing the
analysis of certain samples as follows, in
percentages:
Butter /Minim- Milr
fat. inoids. sueal
â¢J* ft "5 10.05 â¢ 11.4.
4Â° 5.30 4.83 B.Blc
*f 480 7.00 11.50
B i 6 5O 11.J3 10.61
- 9 6.75 6.51 6.40
An analysis of a high quality of cow's
milk shows the following: Butter fat 4
albuminoids. 3.5; milk sugar, 4.8. From
a comparison tne chemist finds that only
one sampleâ No. 29â approximates the
amounts of butter fat, albuminoids and
milk sugar contained in normal milk.
A similar tabulation concerning con
densed milk is also furnished, and from the
figures he finds tnat "the above samples
of condensed milk plainly show that the
butter fat is greatly deiicisnt, ana that,
inasmuch as the sugar of milk and the
albuminoids are greatly in excess that
skimmed milk is uaed in the manufac
ture of these products. I think that a
standard should be adopted which should
compel the manufacturer to condense
four parts of pure, unskimmed milk to one
part weight, an\i suet a product could be
made which contains the stated constitu
ents of milk in equal parts by weight."
Thirteen samples of honey were analyzed.
Four of these were mixed with cane-sugar
syrup, two of the four also being watered.
One, which purported to be pure, white
clover honey, was nearly all glucose; an
other was honey mixed with glucose.
One sample of catsup was found to be
adulterated with salicylic acid and coal
tar color.
One sample of raspberry syrup con
tained cane-sugar syrup, glucose and col
ored with aniline dye and contained no
raspberries.
The veterinary snrgeon has found on
dairies he has inspected 207 animals sus
pected of disease during the past month
and 50 per cent of these were coughing.

BEAUTIFUL WOMEN OF SPAIN

#â¢K^PEAK of the women of Spain, and
yÂ° ur thoughts instantly turn tow
*"â Â»"- ard the region of romance. No
other nation in the world nas won such a
reputation in poetry and song through its
women. Not undeservedly so, either, for
the temperament of the fair senorita is
such as to inspire sentiment. The de
scendants of many distinct races, they
represent every typeol beauty imaginable.
There is a much larger percentage of
blondes and deini-blondes among them
than is commonly supposed ; but the typi
cal Spanish beauty is of course a pro
nounced brunette, with masses of dark
hair, large lustrous eyes, small hands ans
feet, and the carriage of an empress. Her
voice is exceedingly soft and sweet and
her compienon ravishing. But, unhap
ONE OF SEVILLE'S BELLES.
[From a photograph.]
pily, the beauty of the Spanish woman is
ephemeral. She is most attractive 'be
tween the ages of 15 and 25, but after the
latter age stie is very apt to become ex
ceedingly atout. With the lapse of time,
too, her voice loses its melody and be
comes coarse and masculine, and her skin
no longer has a flower-like fairness, but
grows dark.
The young Spanish woman is much
given to stringed instruments, fandangos
and love affairs. Whenever thinks deeply,
because she is rarely educated. Her love
affairs are numerous and romantic. They
must be conducted with great caution,
owing to the extreme watchfulness of her
parents or guardians.
On the busiest promenade of Barcelona
(La Rambla de ias Flores) ihera are a
great number of flower booths. -The
keepers oi them are avowedly tho aiders
of ail love affairs.
It does not take long for a young Span
iard to fall in love. He does not renuire
a six months' acquaintance with a young
lady todiscover wiiether he loves heror not.
He may merely have caught a glimpse of
the fair one at muss; have followed her
home and, concealed near her latticed case
ment, have heard her sing of love, etc,
to the accompaniment of a guitar.
He acts promptly, and. by the way,
there is bat one affair in which a young
Spaniard does act promptly, and tnatis
in an affair of trie heart. He obtains an
impassioned epistle from an escritorio
puolico, or public writer, which is deftly
concealed in a bunch of the fragrant mi
mosa, and with the connivance of a flower
booth keeper it is soon in the hands of the
object of his devotion. The next time
they meet he is rewarded by a flutter of
her fan or a significant look.
His troubles do not end here, however.
The ancient custom of employing duennas
or governesses to keep a watchful eye
upon the unmarried females of a family
still practically prevails. Some mothers
even go so far upon occasions as to lock
their daughters in upper rooms. If the
attentions of the young man are not
looked upon favorably, a ladder is the
only way tc his love, and a romantic flight
by night the last resource.
The fondness of the Spanish women for
dancing is proverbial, and an enthusiastic
writer says : "Who realizes so completely
in every graceful motion and in the superb
sweep of their matchless forms all the
ideal perfection of Hogarth's famous line
of beauty as the Spanish woman."
The lace mantillas of song and story are
still largely worn by women of the lower
and middle classes. The gente fina or
gentlefolks, now very generally take their
fashions from Paris.
The Spanish court, however, has al
ways been noted for its Oriental glitter,
and the state toilettes of Queen Regent
Maria Christiana and the maids of honor
are gorgeous beyond description, being of
every color in the rainbow, and literally
studded with preci&us gems. Ordinarily,
however, the Queen dresses in excellent
taste.
A great hero in the eyes of the fair Cas
tilluna is the bull-fighter. The fact that
the matadors are recruited from the lower
classes does not prevent them from hav
ing many fair admirers, even among ladies
of noble lineage. Not many years ago a
famous matador was kilied in the fieid by
an Andaluslan bull. His trunks, when
opened, were fo^nd to be filled with locks
of hair, ribbons, faded bouquets and love
lettersâ many ot the latter sealed with
coronets and signed by the proudest beau
ties in the land.
The tremendous excitement in the
higher circles of the court following this
discovery culminated in the permanent
disappearance from the latter of certain
ladies of high degree, and the enforced re
tirement of others to the convent.

THE OEIGINAL OF SAM WELLEE.
An Actor Who May llnvo suggested
Sum Weller to Dickens.
The great scarcity of the early numbers
of "Pickwick Papers" is not difficult to
understand when it is borne in mind that
only 400 copies were printed of the first
part, which was published on March 31,
1888. Before the appearance of the fourth
number there was some idea of stopping
the itsue, as the expenses were found to
be in excess of the receipts. But in the
fifth number Sam Weller was introduced,
and the work at once sprang into un
bounded popularity. While nothing posi
tive has ever been established on the
point, it is held by some writers
that the # original of cam Weller
was a Mr. Samuel Vale, who acted
the part of Simon Spatterdash in a farce
called "The Boarding-house," and made
this character a great popular favorite.
The odd whimsicality of V:ile's novel
comparisons is bet understood on refer
ence to tne part set down to Spatterdasn
in the farce. Among his queer com
parisons are: "'I know the world as the
monkey said when he cut off his tail."
*"I am down upon you.' as the extin
tinuuishersaid tothe rasnlight." " 'Come
on, as the man said to the tight boot "
"I am all over perspiration, 'as' the mutton
chop said to the gridiron." " 'Why
here we are all mustered,' as the
roast beef said to the Welsh rarebit
Vale introduced these popular compari
sons in his private life aa well as upon
the stage, and from 1830 to 1836 ibis style
of expression became widely popular It
is not unreasonable to suppose that Dick
ens became, in a sense, the abstract mir
ror of his time, in catching tne popular
fun and embalming it with his choice
pnraseoloev Of course, it would be the
height of absurdity to char e Dickens
with being a mere copyist, or for one mo
ment to think of Sam Welier as any
other than an orieinal character Dick
ens may have borrowed an idea, but he
certainly made no slavish use of it for
the prevailing Sam Valerism and "tha
monkey that Knew the world" was in no
way on a par with the Sam Weller com-
