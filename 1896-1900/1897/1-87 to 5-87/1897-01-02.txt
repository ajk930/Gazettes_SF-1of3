f| -Â° HAVANA*, Cuba, Jan, Lâ .A. reporter of
S c the Diario de la Marina has had ah inter-
I view with Captain-General Weyler in the
| Matp Toro c camp. /Speaking of the situa
â r. tl?n in the provinccoi Pin.ar del Rio Gen
" eral Y\'eyler_ said that, speaking from the
'/ standpoint of strength arid -importance,
the insurrection in that province had -been
I crushed. The few insurgents remaining
|. were obliged to hide like wolves in their
I caves. Fever? arid smallpox have thinned
% ; . the rebel ranks. . His own. colunin an 4
! those of the other Spanish commanders
had overrun Hie base and, interior- of the
hills and-had met no rebels. Â»V
The. insurgents, alter the â¢ death of
Maceo, wjere without a .leader. Riviera.
Maceo's successor, was unpopular" among
his men. General^ Weyler added that his
statements would be confirmed after Gen
erals Melguizo and Aroias had completed
their operations, which included the
sweeping of the province from east to
west. Generals Hernandez, Velaeco,
Obrein, Ruiz, Foentes and Seiruira were
f *no*v in the center of . the * bills. Perhaps
General AroUis was also there. . Once the
Rubi hills were fortified a severe blow
might be directed against the rebels under
Dv cassis. . â  *.'.-. ...
An odd feature of the above interview
is that General" Weyler, while declaring
that Pinar del Rio is practically free of
g insurgents, finds it necessary to have the
1 Rubi hills fortified before he will attempt
"to strike a blow at the rebels under Du
cassis. â  . _

THE CALL.
that fifty-one men, comprisinj? the filibus

desert key by the steamer Three Friends,

put ashore on the barren island after the
Three Friends had been pursued by _ Span
ish gunboats, with which the filibustering
steamer had an exchange of shots, and the
cargo of arms and ammunition, provis
ions, etc., on board the steamer were also
landed with the men. The Three Friends,
being closely pursued by, the Spanish war
vessels, was compelled to â¢ put the men
ashore on this barren island or take them
back to the United States, and it was iii
making an attempt to leave the island, the
dispatch says, that they were drowned.
The dispatch also says that 360 rifles,
which the filibusters had with them, were
lost in the sea. - . . . '
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 1.-Cubans in
this city scout the report of the drowning'
of; the members of the Three Friends
expedition. Tbey note the fact that the
news comes by way of Madrid;' though the
island is not far from Key West, and such
a disaster must of a certainty, if true, have
reached there.. Dr. Costillo of ' the Cuban
Junta said: "The report is ridiculoti'*.
There is no truth in it. "-.lt : is a pure fabri
cation.; We know where our -men- are.
They, are all right." ; ' Beyond this the
doctor would. say nothing.' 'â¢' " â¢* .;:
JACKSONVILLE, L_.a_. Jan. There
is ho longer any doubt that the â - Three
Friends expedition Was landed on Florida
Key after the vessel had been chased from
the Cuban coast by a : Spanish patrol-boat.
A telegram, from Mama says that the
Dauntless, reported there last night and
went on to No Name Key, where a large
body of men are reported to be wrecked
and that two of their number are reported
to-be dead; A telegram from Key West
says that when the steamer City of Rich^
mond passed No Name Key the Dauntless
was then taking on board a party of men
arid a cargo. .
The Three Friends still in the custoay
of the Collector of Customs. No legal
proceedings have, yet been instituted
against the vessel or crew.
The statement seritlfrora Madrid of tbe
drowning of ,' fifty-one men landed â on
Florida Key by the; steamer. Three Friends
is declared by the : Cubans here to be a
mistake. J. A. Huau, agent of the" Junta,
says if the story .was true he would be so
informed.- ..;.
TM OSE PRO MIS ED r REFORMS.
How Spain. intends to Proceed in Porto
â Rica and Cuba.
WASHINGTON, .{'C."; Jan. Lâ The
effect of .the : reforms proposed .by the
Spanish Govern ment for Porto Rico, when
extended to Cuba, as is proposed when the
insurrection had been brought under fur
ther control, will be to create three sets of
administrative bodies in the island inde
pendent of the representatives of Cuba in
the Spanish.Co rtes. The voters under a
system of limited suffrage are already per
mitted to choose the boards of aldermen
of municipalities and the mayors are to be
chosen from these boards by vote of their
members. _ The next body in rank is the
Provincial Assembly, of which there is
only one in Porto Rico, but one for each
of tbe six provinces of Cuba. The func
tions of the' Provincial Assembly T are
lanrely united with those cf the proposed
council of administration iii the case of
Porto Rico, because there is but one body.
The Council., of , Administration will -be
an independent body Cuba arid will for
the first time give the .Cubans a large
share "of control over their 'iuternal
domestic concerns. : The home - Govern
ment will retain control of * the , laws
levying taxation and 'will reserve y the
right to review the budget of appropria
tions, but trie appropriations wilt be made
by the Council of Administration, subject
to the approval of the Ministry; at Madrid.
The Spanish Government does not pro
pose at present to widen the limits of the
suffrage, which extends to -â¢ persons pay
ing a combined tax of $5 and to several of
the learned professions. ; The . reforms in
contemplation' for Cuba ' are largely those
which were embodied " in ; the decree iof
March 15, 1895, but which have not been
put in force* because of the insurrection.
Changes which have been proposed in
this law will require to be submitted to
the Cortes at their meeting in the spring,
but it is not doubted that the plans pro
posed by the Ministry will be accepted.

ENTERTAINED.
New Year's Day One Round of
Pleasures From Morning Until â¢# o
â¢ a Midnight. '...-. Wm
* Burlingame Club has just seen the best
day in its whole career. It was
the' celebration of' New Year's yester
day, with all the pleasure of social gather
ing, lunch, ball, supper aud the outdoor
sports .of steeplecbasing, following the
hounds, driving and pigeon-t.hoot.ng com
bined in delightful hours between noou
and midnight.
.There is â :â  a time-honored saying that
whatever you do on New .Year's . day your
do every day in the year, and. if there ba
anything in this Barlingame has its best ..
year so far before itâ a twelvemonth of
sociability, manly sport, good cheer in its
quaint clubhouse and beautiful home life
in the villas nestling among the old oaks
in the hilly park. * .
, Charter members of the clubâ if there be
such membersâ ..aid . more than once yes
terday that the reception was far superior
to anything of its; kind ever before held
there. It brought out mere people than
previous events, was more diversified, as
enough for a week was rolled into one day
and . night, . and every part of the pro
gramme passed as merry as the music of
marriage bells. Besides the midwinter
day was warm, the air crisp and invigor
ating and redolent of the sweetness of
green grasses and fragrant trees.
m As hosts and guestsâ they were all
one. Everybody knew every other body,
so it was all like a reunion of old friends
or . kinsfolk. Â Of course, there was style,
and a great deal of it â in a subdued way
following trie fashion of country sport that
is well established in the older society of
the South and the East.
The ladies appeared in quiet costumes,
some corning out in furs, as the morning
had a suggestion of frost ; the gentlemen
were content, with fashionable tweed suits,
only those who participated in the hunt
or in horseback-riding wearing appropri
ate, apparel. .To Â«a stranger the whole
party seemed bent on having an easy,
pleasurable day.
' The .picturesque clubhouse was trans
formed into a festal spot with nice taste.
The broad veranda was decorated -with
evergreens that completely hid the walls
and pillars and intermingled with trailing
plants and blooming shrubs and flowers.
Then there were ample masses of â  Christ
mas berries scattered through the foliage,
while _ overhead . the ceiling was hidden
with 'great Oriental umbrellas and Japan
ese lanterns that gave rich color to the
scene. . Tables were here set out in ele
gant style for luncheon. The large
dining-room looked particularly pretty
with similar decorations, and cozy
rough the â¢ associations of huge logs
crackling a merry song in the open fire
place, and tete-a-tete tables set out similar
to those outside.
Here the guests assembled at different
hours during the day and evening, and it
was very late when they bid a reluctant
farewell to the. spot where they enjoyed
so much of the good things of life.
The first event of the day was a contest
among members of the club for the Bur
lingame cup as a prize for the best shot at
live pigeons.
About a minute's walk from the club
house the traps were set out, and though
the, morning air was chill there was a fair
attendance at the sport. ,
' The shoot was .held under Coun
try ' Club rules, each contestant shoot
ing at twelve pigeons. It was a
cood, hard struggle that kept the
shooters alert from start to finish,' as the
birds were, as a rule, fairly fast and came
from the traps apparently in good form,
and one needed to be in trim for handling
a dextrous gun.
* Richard Carroll , acted as referee, as
might be expected^ and, of course, his de
cisions were quite satisfactory to all con
.erned. Among the members there was
much friendly rivalry in this event and
indeed it aroused considerable interest.
â â¢ Fred Webster arrived late, but went at
once .to' the traps and killed his ten

â¢'tween mud arid slippery sods. However,
'.the gentleman riders had to do their very
. best, for was not the gaze of the ladies
Centered on each and every one, and was

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 1.-The
annual New Year's show at the White
House 'took place- to-day according to
lone-established custom. It constitutes
the yearly ordeal of tne President and' the
mistress of the . White House,, for they
must shake hands with many hundreds â
several thousands in fact â of their fellow- â¢
citizens and -a large number of distin
guished foreigners. They smiled and
bowed and beamed through it all to-day,
and stifled the winces that unconsciously
followed the hearty grasp of some young
subaltern, fresh from the frontier, or the
grip of some horny ; hand that had done
service in the late political campaign. It
was one continual round of handshaking
and exchanging the compliments of the
season." : . " - '.:'â ..*.' ." :
As on last New Year's. day the crowd
that participated in and witnessed the
reception was very large, It was the last
function of its sort in which Mr. and Mrs.
Cleveland will' figure as the principal
characters, and this may '-'â  have , been
responsible in part for the throng that
paraded the corridors and apartments dur
ing the time set apart for the reception.'
The interior of the mansion had been
lavishly decorated for . the occasion. â¢ A
suggestion of the tropics was given by a
survey of the decorative arrangements. Jn
the dainty oval-shaped blue room, the
â¢official chamDer of the White House, with
its delicately tapestried walls, the artistic
effect was well carried out. ylt was in this
apartment that the President, Mrs. Cleve
land and the receiving party stood. â '
... Tho-e who paid their .respects to the
President and Mrs. Cleveland passed' out
of their receiving-chain into tbe green
room, and thence into the spacious east
room, the scene of so many historic occur
rences. Six hundred people is the ordi-
capacity of this compartment.
To-day it was filled to an uncomfortable
degree with foreign envoys, officers of the
army and navy, high judicial function
aries, Senators, Representatives arid many
civilian*;, with a large number of ladies.
They were not so crowded, however, as to
be unable to see and appreciate .the floral
beauty displayed." As in every other part
of the interior, the east room had its
chandeliers and cornices twined with srai
lax. Trailing asparagus also formed ' a
graceful drapery. The white jardinieres
on ail the mantels held Chinese primroses,
rubber, plants and cinerias. In the cor
ners were brown-leaved curculis. .Date
and cocoanut palms spread, their foliage
high over the promenading guests. .'The
broad and high east window was a mass
of pom sett a palms, and grouped about
the bottom of these were ferns. The mir
rors, the embrasures, the fireplaces were'
all suitably arranged. . ;â '.'.'. \
Eleven o'clock was the hour, set for the
beginning of the reception.' Before., that
time members of the diplomatic corp-,
Embassadors,. Ministers, attaches ana
their wives and daughters, had begun .to
arrive and were' ushered into the red
room, where they only waited the signal,
to pass alone the line. Out in the public
lobby, the United States marine band,
under the leadership of Professor Fan
ciulli, waited the signal to play.' Suddenly
Fanciulli waved his baton arid the various
instruments .burst forth into' the well
known air of "Hail to the Chief.'' .Down
the private staircase came the President,.
Mrs. Cleveland, the members of the Cabi
net and their ladies, led. by Colonel John '.
N. Wilson, United States Commissioner
of Public; Buildings and Grounds' and
master of ceremonies. * Colonel Wilson,
was attired in tbe uniform of a colonel of

from all over the State. y,'yy y ;: ",'â  '

After prayer by the Rev. Bishop Doane
Governor Morton was introduced and de
livered his address to the people of the
State as their retiring chief executive, and
the manner in which his remarks were re
ceived was a testimonial ot the apprecia
tion of his auditors. Governor Morton's
speech consisted of -' a lengthy review of
recent constitutional ; and statutory de
velopment and an expression of thanks to
the people of the State for the honors con
ferred upon him and a few congratulatory
remarks to his successor in office.' . â¢ "-'

Governor Morton : The sentiments which
you have uttered would be agreeable. from any
source, but they have an added value and sig
nificance coming from you, for many years a
conspicuous public figure. In these days,
when criticism has passed down into denunci
ation and fitness is too often measured by the
power to bestow, the task of public office has
become arduous and full of danger, but it is
to-day your singular fortune to lay off the
robes of public station with a larger share of
affection and respect than is often accorded to
a retiring public servant. If your official. acts
' have not always met the people's â¢' approval
you at least have never lost, the people's con
fidence.:, And. no higher testimonial can be
written to a__y man than tbis, that in these
contentious' times be s.ood at the spot where
every conflict centered "and ; so commanded
and disposed as never to relax his hold upon
the faith of those who trusted hirri with power.
This great measure of satisfaction and reward
now longs to you, and as you retire to enjoy
it end share, the pride of its achievement with
those which close companionship will here
after surround and . sustain you. I hope you
will indulge me the high privilege of > adding
to the general applause my own expressions of
approbation, not unmixed wKh â¢ personal
sentiment. â¢"â¢ '. â¢ .
: Fellow-cltiaens: A voyager making the' first
shore may depart', followed b.v the hopes and
loud acclaims of those who fitted, out his ship,
but if you listen intently to- the' tumult and
the music you may find the note of confidence
left out. must. wait for that until he has
returned. ; Perhaps you may never hear it, but
it It is lacking at the beginning of the voyage
let us hope to find it at the close. However
meager may. be the signs of promise now,
there is this which is not without hope: No
executive. will this year take the oath of office
.uhder a deeper sense of responsibility. than he
who now assumes with diffidence .the great
and unaccustomed -burdens which the people
of this State have posed. Your counsel in
all matters relating' to the welfare of the State
must always be received by those who realize
that the first duty of 'a Â° public servant ls to
guard the public interest. â¢ : '.'
.-' I shall strive during my career as" Governor
to be faithful in the performance' of that trust
upon which I now enter.' To be watchful of
the people's welfare and to execute their will
will.be my earnest purpose, for* in them abides
the supreme command and irom them the last
order must always come. And' -with this in
tention to serve you 1 shall associate, as far as
I am able, the right of judgment and the sense
of personal accountability which must always
accompany the executive station. .
. No mistaken sense of power will prevent that
just and careful treatment which is every citi
zen's duty. yNo pride ,of opinion will retard
the fullest recognition and.acknowledgment of
any view that' may .tend: to", the public good
and no' intolerant clamor -or irresponsible
assault wilt force or prevent | a single execu
tive act. i For . I think no man who possesses
the attribute of fear is worthy to play a part in
the discharge of a public duty. .'.; ,;y; .'".
" This Government rests upon a foundation in
which neutral tolerance is a confident support.
The recognition of this adhesive power has
built upon this continent a government so
unique and strong that no shock of foreign
revolution i or disaster : has i disturbed it, and
even the clash and turbulence of civil war
have not destroyed it. % The foundations of our
Government are laid sure and deep, but a
structure.which riot even war could overthrow
may yield to Intolerance "arid .; trust. "There
are those who believe they see Images and por
tents that ; predict a storm. y There are marks
which I fear point to Increasing dissatisfac
tion and unrest >'-_--_'- . â .
. . Marvelous as our growth has been we , have
not passed; the point where human motives
still control us, and .where human passions
must be kept . in check. History always, re
peating itself in circles will distinguish that
as the .', most . enlightened ' government ' yet
known which has so cultivated and raised its
people up that they, sure in mutual honor and
esteem, will dare exhibit to the world forbear
ance as tbe highest proof of courage. I hope
that there is before us a distinction greater
than which no people ever strove to reach; jit
is that when, the next circle of wars is traced
upon 8 the ' earth < the American Nation shall
stand outside the baneful ring. There is upon
us all a duty to curb the unbridled speech and
act whose tendency is to weaken and dissever,
and 'to cultivate that _"'; reason and careful
moderation which shall draw and hold us near
together. *" â¢
The Governor's brevity in speech' was
a v surprise ; ; to those â¢ not \ familiar ?; with
: his public utterance,- but his remarks re
ceived pleasing recognition. This ended
the ceremonies, which were . enlivened by
patriotic airs from the Tenth ; Regiment

VALLEJO, cal., Jan. I.â William H.
Skerrett, chief clerk of the commandant
at the Mare Island Navy-yard, r ceived
to-day the sad intelligence of the death of
his brother, Rear-Admiral Joseph S. Sker
rett, U. S. N., on the retired list, which oc
curred at Washington at 12 o'clock last
night from, paralysis. Admiral Skerrett
was in command of the Pacific squadron
about four years ago, and relieved Admi

â¢ born in Chillicothe, Ohio/. January 18,
- 1833, and when he was old enough had the
choice offered to him by the Congressman
from his district of going either to An
>o napolis or West Point. He chose Annap
olis and in 1854 was graduated at the head
of his class. Within the next year he was
made lieutenant and was attached to a
. number of vessels. While on the Sara

V Service on the slave coast in wartime
did "riot satisfy Lieutenant Skerrett, al
'" though he rose to be first lieutenant arid
â¢executive of the ship, for he wanted to be
in the thick of the fighting at home. But
:'â  some one had prejudiced Secretary Welles
.-against him by' telling him that Mrs.
Â â¢ .skerrett sympathized with the South. â 
Lieutenant Skerrett had married the
â¢*; belle of. Washington, Miss Margaret Love
Taylor, the daughter of Captain A. Syd
-.' ney Taylor of â¢ the Marine Corps, and the
.. grand-daughter of Joseph Meehari, Libra
rian of Congress and a well-known littera
teur. Mis- Taylor was very bright," as
y. well as very beautiful, and had many ad
" mirers and friends, in Washington and
."â¢throughout the South. Secretary Welles
â -,_ had no reason whatever to doubt the loy
alty of Lieutenant Skerrett, but he. was
evidently sufficiently affected by what was
said to him about Mrs. Skerrett's Southern
friendships to be unwilling to give Sker
rett a fair chance to show his devotion
.* and achieve distinction in- the -face of the
: - "-enemy." He was ordered home, but it was
. only to do duty as ordnance officer at the
. Washington Navy -yard. ' y -.
-. ". He was hurt by this treatment and ten
dered his resignation, -but Secretary
V Welles gave him the choice of withdraw
ing his resignation or being imprisoned in
y Port Mifflin and he chose the former al
â ternative. In 1863 he was sent to the
1 West Indies to watch for Confederate
cruisers and subsequently was kept on the
outlook for blockade-runners. In 1868, in
conjunction with Commander Ups'her, he
. framed the regulations for "the apprentice
. system then started in the navy.
__ . He started on a surveying trip in 1872,
which" consumed three years and yielded
' valuable results. While on this voyage he
arrived at Hawaii just in time to be of
great service to the American interests,
Kalakaua having just been elected king,
'â¢: the old royal family being extinct and the
opponents of Kalakaua having started a
rebellion, which was quelled before any
damage had been done to life or property
by the presence and influence of Captain
Skerrett and Captain Belknap and their
* forces. â¢ King Kalakaua presented Cap
tain Skerrett with the highest decoration
in his gift in recognition of his services,
which, were also _ appreciated - and ap
plauded by all the foreigners in Honolulu
and by the United States Government.
One" of his latest and most important
acts had also to do with Hawaii. In De
cember, 1892, he was sent to command the
Pacific station at Honolulu and his ex
periences there are still fresh in the public
mind. In November, 1894, he was sent to
command; the Asiatic, station, where) he
remained until he retired the following

MEANS A POWERFUL TRUST.
Nearly Every Oatmeal and Cereal Mill in
the Country to Enter a
. .â Combine. ~ > â 
CHICAGO, lit , Jan -.2,â A morn pa
per says Nearly every oatmeal and cereal ,
mill in the United States has just entered
into an agreement that amounts to a pow
erful trust to regulate the output and
prices of oatmeal, roiled bats and other
breakfast cereals.
The new trust that threatens to drive
out of existence the smaller mills of the
country so as to make a big advance in
prices as soon as the conditions of. trade
will allow it is called the Cereal Millers'
Association. . Ten days ago the repre
sentatives of the mills in the trust held a
meeting in this city and another meeting
will probably be held here by January 12,
when it is likely thai if .the trade outlook
has improved by that time there will be a
big advance in prices.
. . The general manager of the association
is George W. Brown of Sioux City, Robert
Stuart, secretary of the American Cereal
Company, said yesterday of the combine:
: : "The Cereal Millers' Association, or
whatever it is called, held a meeting in
this city ten days ago, and -most of the
cereal mills, I .understand, were .repre
sented. We have not been asked to join
the combination, and 1. do not think it
strong enough to raise prices.?-.;

REDWOOD CITY, Cal:,; Jan. I.â Three

Jail, charged with, one of .the most cruel
and heartless acts ever perpetrated in this
section of the Slate. They were' captured
several days ago, and the details'; of their
crime were brought out in the preliminary

charge against. them was robbery and 'ar

Frank Schmute, an old man) lives', in
the lonely mountainous country eighteen
or twenty miles distant from here, known
as the Alpine District. Two weeks ago
to-night.* while sitting in' his house, he was
aroused by somebody knocking at his
door. .Responding, to the knock he was
confronted by a man who asked him to
step out, on the pretext of /desiring.; to
speak to him. â¢_ He emerged . from his
dwelling and was seized by two men, who
gagged and blindfolded him and led -him
to a spot two hundred yards from the
house, where he was tied to a â¢'. tree. v After
binding i him securely the : footpads re
turned to the house, which they ransacked
from tcp 'â¢â  to bottom, carrying . off every
thing of value which was portable. !
â¢. Not being satisfied with, thus stripping;
the old man of all his personal. property,
they set fire to his house.*- After the fire
had started the two, accompanied by a
third, returned to where they "had bound;
the old man, removed, the bandage from
his eyes and invited him to enjoy the bon
fire they had : kindled; .Strange - to say,
none of the men wore. masks or attempted
to conceal their identity in any way, and
as a result Sen mute was - enabled, to get. a
good description of them. The trio left
him bound to a tree, where he was found
the next morning, . more dead than alive,
by persons passing by, and was released
by them. i
Schmute immediately communicated
with the Sheriff's office and search was in
stituted for the three robbers. Until the
following Wednesday; â¢no . trace of the
criminals could be found, but on that day
the ; Sheriff succeeded in running V down
two of the men. The third was captured
two days later, and now all three are be
hind the bars of the County.. Jail with a,
charge of robbery and arson against the
name of each. Old Schmute positively
identifies all the men, and the Sheriff has
procured sufficient evidence to convict
them.- -â¢:â /.; [:-.. '.;â '-â  . -â .. -y. 'â¢Â» -... :x-y.i.. 'â â "'â â¢ ' '

Rapidly DUappeau-fag Â»- an Art. of
Commerce- -
*'T__te old-fashioned molasses .is rapidly
disappearing, as an article of commerce,"
said a prominent grocer to. a Washington
, Star reporter, "aod in its place haye come
a numberof syrups, which are more costly,
and "by no means as* satisfactory.- espe
cially to the little-oses, who delight, as we
did when' we were young, in hating
lasses on their bread.' ....''.. '
"Most of the molasses goes into the dis
tilleries, where it is made. Into rum. for
which, notwithstanding the efforts of our
temperance workers, the demand ;Â« con
stantly on the increase, especially in tbe
New England States ar.d for the export
trade. The regular drinker of rem will
take no other liquor in its place if he can
help it. It seems to reach the spot more
'directly than any other dram.: .
. "The dark-brown sugars have also dis
- appeared; and they a_re nerer likely to re-
turn, owing to the methods of boiling and
the manufacture. Granulated sugar is of
the same composition, as far as saccharins,
qualities are concerned, as | loaf, cst'lcaf. ,
cube and crushed, and differs from -them
only in that its- crystals do ! not cohere.
This is bemuse it "is ednÂ«*_an__y stirred
during the process of crystal!: ration. The
lighter -brown sugars' taste sweeter . than
the white, 'for the reason that "there is
some molas_.es ia them. ry - i
"Housekeepers haTe difficulty these,
days in finding coarse, dark sugars, Which
are always preferred for use in putting up
sweet pickles, making cakes and similar
uses. As they cannot get brown sugar any
more, it may be well for . them to remem
ber that they can simulate brown sugar by
adding a teaspoon! ul of , molasses to each
quarter of a pound of the white granulated'
'sugar. This combination : does as well in
all household receipts that, call for brown
sugar as the article itse.f, and, besides, it
saves them a great : deal of banting for
brown sugar, which, as said before, has
disappeared trom the market,*" -A _,_ ,
Wa-hinjton Old-Time Card Cwatonaa
"There is hardly any observance now of
what was a time-honored "custom once in
the matter of Congressional â¢ calls,*" - said
an old - employe- of the . Senate.' "On the
first day, of every 'session -erery Senator
sent his personal Â» card to every otber Sen
ator - as, well Â«s to the Representatives
of "his own - State, %to . the â â¢: members of
the -Cabinet, the Supreme Court,

they, were ready ; to- receive callers. .The
custom, as far .* as . gerferal 'observance is
concerned, died (out ' aboet ten- or fifteen

out sooner bad it not been . for the pers'is

BY HOMER PIGEON.
An Important Move Was
Made by A. Carlisle'
:;y^;.. Yesterday. .
Secured Miss Doud's Promise to
Help Found the Farallon
Line.
She Is Ready to Teke Hold of the
Public Prcj-*ct at Once With
Right Good Will.
The United States Weather Bureau will
soon be able to realize the wish, long
cherished byMessrs.Hammon and McAdie,
to sacure regular and rapid communica
tion with . the Farallon Islands. This
comes about largely through the enter
prise of A. Carlisle, the expert pigeon
fancier. , Mr. Carlisle, hearing of the ap-
pointment of Miss Daisy Doud as school
teacher at the North Farallon Island,
visited her yesterday at her residence at
2211 Steiner street and proposed tbat she
should assist in establishing the boming
pigeon service.
1 Miss Doud took hold of this plan with
characteristic vigor and enterprise. She
is preparing, to start for the Farallones,
and will probably go out one week from
to-morrow. She intended to start upon
the lighthouse tender, but discovered that
the steamer will not touch at the islands
for some time. Mr. Wood, her uncle,
then began to negotiate for a launch. Mr.
Wood was at home yesterday and con
tented to have the first installment of
homing pigeons to be furnished, by Mr..
Carlisle placed upon the launch upon
which Miss Doud will proceed. . Mr. Car
lisle will also probably go out in charge of
the birds. ; *./_
Mis Doud will be active in forwarding
the purpose in view. She - consented to
take charge of the homing birds that may
be sent to her by Mr. Carlisle from time
to time and to care for them and release
them at intervals. She also expressed
perfect willingness to make such weather
observations as could be brought within
her present scope, like noting ihe direc
tion of the wind, wind velocity and the
rainfall, whenever the proper apparatus
could be supplied, if the Weather Bureau
desires her co-operation. Finally, with
her own hands, she released two homing
birds whioh Mr. Carlisle had brought, to
see how it would seem.
Mr. McAdie of the Weather Bureau said:
ast night that such work as might be re-
J quired from Miss Doud she would un
doubtedly be able to perform. He was
evidently pleased at the zeal which she
manifested, and said that he would com
municate with Forecast Official Ham
mon, who has been trying to establish
the service, with the co-operation of the
Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Carlisle.
Mr. Harnraon will therefore learn of the
new possibilities to-day.
The- principal difficulty heretofore in
the way of . this enterprise has been the
Jack of means lor getting the birds to tbe
islands. Mr. Carlisle patriotically offered
some time ago to furnish homers free for
a period that the experiment of establish
ing the service .might be fairly tried. But
there are very few vessels going to the
islands. The permanent location of Miss
Doud as a schoolteacher will be a very
material assistance. The plan as pro
posed by Mr. Carlisle is to take over a
large number of birds and to seek as favor
able location for them as possible on the
North Farallon. They can be liberated
as the emergency may arise. Ultimately
a cote can be established on the islands
and birds reared there," which will insure
a service in both directions.
! There will no difficulty in transmitting
all the data that the Weather Bureau may
wish. A new invention, designed for such
service, consists of a tiny aluminum cyl-*
inder weigDing only eight grains, and pro
vi.ied with a clasp by which to fasten it
about the leg of the bird.. -To fit this slips
of paper, carefully prepared, are also pro
vided. Upon one of these slips from 200
to 300 words can easily be written, and the
paper will hardly add to the weight of the
[ cylinder, being very thin.
The birds being released will fly to the
I lofts of Mr. Carlisle in Berkeley, and as
| soon as they arrive the messages they
I may bring will at once be telephoned to this
City if the arrangements are made by Mr.
liammon for the Weather Bureau.- There
S is little doubt that will promptly avail
himself of this very favorable chance to
I carry out his pel scheme as soon as he can
I secure -? the necessary authorization and
[ apparatus to pat it into effect. *
The advantages to be derived, from the
proposed service have, to some extent,
i been pointed out previously. There are
' many storms of which notice could be
j * given in advance and materially facilitate â¢
Jklbe work of weather forecasting. In addi
tion to this the shipping interest can be
a'sisted, very often, by prompt informa
tion concerning vessels wanting aid, ves
fels with contagious diseases and so on.
The time which would probably be con
sumed by the birds in flying from the
Farallones to Berkeley ought not to ex
ceed two hours, and probably will be
much less. The distance is a mere baga
telle to trained birds, for it has been
I demonstrated that homers will fly be
tween Â£00 and 600 miles between sunrise
_ and sunset. Members of the Chamber of
| Commerce, who were seen yesterday after
noon, spoke very .avorably of the pro
posed bird -Hue, for ii is what they have
long wanted.

THE -BUSY QUEEff.
Her Private .Letters Take a Great Deal
â 'â  . of. Victoria's Time. ' I
." Queen Victoria's private letters number I
many hundred every year. - She writes to i
her numerous relatives, forgetting no an
niversary or occasion when a letter might j
be welcome. The London Chronicle says ]
that to the younger members of the royal i
family she never fails to send birthday |
gifts, accompanied by a few loving words
of greeting. ;
Every day the birthday book is. con
sultedânot that birthday book in which â 
singers, actors and other personages are
asked to write, but . that smaller volume j
reserved for relatives and intimates. i
Then there are numerous letters of a j
semi-private nature which are wr:iten by '
the Queen herselfâ letters of condolence, i
letters of congratulation to brides who
have been connected with the court, let
ters to foreign monarens. Besides ail ]
these epistles, written in the blackest, of
ink on paper, slightly edged with black, .
there are thousands which are penned by ,
the private secretary and his assistants. .
The Queen's day . begins early and ends
late: . After breakfastâ a meal which she
siiil enjoys eating in the open air when
possibleâ there are the . newspapers and
private . correspondence claiming atten
tion. . With regard to the former, portions
of the Times arid other journals are read
aloud to the Queen by a lady specially ap
â¢ oiiited for. this purpose. Very rarely

tion. Not long.ago an illustrated London
pager gave a picture in which her Majesty 1
was represented as holding the arm of her
Indian attendant. â¢ Within . a short space
of time a member of the: royal household
called, on the editor to state the absurdity
of such an error..
"The Queen is much annoyed at the
mistake on the part of your artist, as jit
might give grievous offense to important
persons in India. [ She never could; take
the arm; of a servant." This will show
how closely she watches even the pictorial
press.. : When a good illustration appears
of any state function it is a common inci

the Queen, very liKely to receive a com

' After nearly twelve years of hardship

Emile Marque, its editor and proprietor,
now a man in the seventies, delivered the

â¢ In his choicest ; French 'he said.: "lam

Emile Marque is probably the best
known and one of the most disliked
Frencnmen in the. -.local' colony. 'Â When
E. Derbec owned Le Courrier de San Fran
cisco, the only French paper in this City
a quarter of a century ago, Emile Marque
was its editor in chief. ;.;..*'
Derbec was a wealthy miner In those
days and cared little for money. He owned
a paper simply that he. believed his
countrymen should be furnished with
news from "La I'atrie," that was all." He
cared little whether it cost him a tew
thousand dollars a year to keep the paper
goingâit was his fad. Derbec '.is now in

Emile Marque had the entire control of
Le Courrier de ' San Francisco and he
swung his ax in a wild -way. V He made
many friends but more enemies. Derbec
was obliged to call a halt and Alfred
Chaigneau bought out the plant, merging
it into the Le Franco-Californien. That
paper has been the representative one ot
the French colony ever since successful
and bright daily.
"â¢ Marque's few friends picked him up
about twelve years ago as their champion.
These friends were mostly among tne
wealthy Hebrews of French descent who
in subseauent years were subjected to dis
graceful attacks in "Lo Bayard," a little
French weekly paper published by the
notorious Barra. : The latter fled the
country some six years ago rather than
face the Grand Jury indictments lor libel
found against him.
Marque handled a trenchant pen and
he took up the battle waged by Barra
against the Jews. While the fight lasted
La Petit Califomien prospered right
nicely. When "Le Bayard" went out of
existence Marque's paper also fell until
the old man finally had to give, up the
struggle. He id still vigorous and com
paratively healthy, however, and hopes to

that George Washington accepted his ap

room for the Continental Congress, and the
Declaration was signed July 4, 1776. A

gives nn excellent idea of the arrangements
of the chamber at that time. The picture
has been carefully studied by Architect T.
Mellon Hosers, who has the.alterations in

bulbs are more apt. to be- single. It may
be it just happens so, but it is generally
supposed that the manner of growth
mattes a difference. It certainly Is not an
infallible rule, as I - haye ; had , double
flowers on water-grown -bulbs and vice
versa. .; y. .-:_â - â¢ .'.â¢-.,
;.â¢ For , quick blooming choose a dish
maybe -5 inches in depth, and with an
open top. â  I have used a lar.e rose bowl,
but these are too small at the top and too
large and deep to : . be wholly, satisfactory.
I think better than. porcelain. Hav
ing selected your dish, take your bulbs
and place them on a, layer of sand, peb
bles or shells, then pack' the sand well
around the bulbs in such a way that when
the roots begin to push up from " the bot
tom of the. receptacle they will not push
the bulb itself out of thp water. The
seems to me to be about the only thing to
be looked out for. .Water is the chief es
sential to strong growth, and this must be
supplied frequently, even to bulbs water
grown, as they/soon drink up what is
placed in a shallow dish. I like to keep
my dishes full of water, and it is an easy
matter every. morning to. fill the glasses.
It is not necessary that the bulbs -should
be covered with water, but it' is necessary
that tbey should be about half submerged.
. * Bits of charcoal placed in the water will
keep rt sweet, 'and a little ammonia in the.
water will assist in-nourishing the bulb. . â 
Last winter I grew some eight bulbs in
a box, and- when 1 say eight I mean eight
large bulbs, and these -were" surrounded
by some' four or live smaller ones, '< so
Erobably there were . some thirty or forty
ulbs together.- The box was about six
inches in' depth, was filled with good noil,
and the buls more than half covered with
it. v They were packed , in about as closely
as they.- could- be, .room' only . being
left through ..which, the water could
easily run down the thirsty roots. The
box was set. in a south window in.-a room,
in which no lire was -kept, but opening
off from one kept very well warmed. ::' Thp
bulbs were, watered freely and frequently.
The' Soil may be almost muddy if not cold
enough to Tot ttie bulbs. Plenty of ; water
omust0 must be supplied. . This V box was a .'sight
to be remembered when once seen. t; Sim
ply a mass of blossoms and probably- half
a dozen stalks nearly from each big bulb.
The blossoms were 1 all double, except
those' produced by one bulb.â Boston

Presents to Presidents,
The President who has not a bundred
canes on hand either does not amount io
much or "else has been very active in dis
posing of his gifts. Closely allied to the
-canes are the symbolical gifts, like gavels
made from the tree under which Henry
Clay delivered some famous speech or the
house in which Martin Van* Buren- died,.
or paper-weights made the first tin
plate manufactured in the United States
or the v heaviest cable ' ever , produced .in
'America. . Few things that are good to eat
are sent to the ; President. Sometimes a
barrel of the .handsomest apples or a fat
turkey," or a fine string of trout, or a piece
of venison is sent to the White House, but
as a rule this class of gifts-is not large. '"Cf
Mention should be made : also of the
curious things which curious people work
out. Some â  man -in : jail : will cut out of a
shingle ay very perfect representation of a
locomotive, or a lunatic will construct* a

horseback, and in front of him wasciirclng
an Irish setter. As the fellow did not have
any 'gun â_ my curiosity . was - aroused to
know what he was doing, but I suppos.d be
was simply breaking his dbg. In a few
minutes I saw him .ride up to where the
dog was on a dead .stand, and. the horse
man proceeded to jab a pole he was carry
ing down into the ground, and, bringing
it up, took something off the end' of , it.
My. curiosity was greater than ever, and,
circling around, I came up with the horse
man and asked him what he was doing.
'Hunting frogs,' was" the reply. â ;â¢'_,-â  - :

"A few more questions and answers
brought out the fact that the 'dog had seen
his master hunting- around in tbe grass
for frogs and spearing them.and had of
hiaown accord taken up the task of locat

The close of the .old year came' with a
'vengeance to the employes of the coiners'
department of . the Mint in this City. *. It
came with an order from the. powfers dis

congritulaiing themselves and.-one!an

assured by t-1-.e introduction of civil 'ser
â  vice' rules in the mints of ; the United

blandishments for mint employes, proved
their undoing. -. â¢'â¢_
' Instead "of finding _ their names placed
on the civil- service roll, whereby life posi

names .was prepared, under instructions
from Washington, of. those; .employes
whose qualifications were supposed to en
titla them 'â  to recommendation :as â¢ civil
service officials. ;. * - . .
The list was prepared in due form and
dispatched to the Department of the
Treasury in Washington Thursday after
noon. ' It did â¢ not include the names of
nine men who believed themselves" abso
. lute.! y' secure. â¢ â¢ . *
. ' The whole matter has been kept very
secret, so much so that the names could
not be ascertained yesterday. , *.
, To. A. T. Spot ts, who has charge of the
coining department, the selection of civil
servants was left, and it appears ihat Su
perintendent Daggett bad little or nothing
to say about the matter, v Spotts received
his . appointment from Washington, inde-
of the Superintendent, and conse
quently was in a position to wield consid
erable authority without consulting other
officials' in the local establishment. '
'Â. He is said to have swung his ax and cut
a wide swath in the ranks "of faithful ad
herents of a branch of . the Democracy hot
wholly in harmony with his own particu
lar faction. .. And inth'is way" the forces of
an opposing * wing is * gieatly^, weakened.*

are debarred from entering the civil service
occupied regular positions 8 and were not
on the extra list. More than that, it was
believed they were positive of their selec

SUGAR IMPORTATIONS.
Ths showing made before the Ways and
Means Committee bjr the advocates of pro
i tection to the American sugar industry
must have been tuoroughly convincing to
every one who is not so extreme a freer
trader as to be willing to sacrifice any and
all of our home industries rather than in
. terfere with unrestricted competition. -In
almost no otner industry is the- American
so unfairly matched with his European-,
competitor, for the sugar producer has to
meet not only the rivalry of cheaper wages-,
but the aid given to the European manu
facturer by Government bounties.
The. cost to the people of the United
States of imported sugar was explained, to
the committee by. .Mr. .- Myrick .of ' New
York in a striking way. ' He. pointed out
that it required every poUnd of wheat and
flour exported by the United Stale's during
the last fiscal year to pay for the sugar
bought from foreign nation's. The total
â¢value -of .live " and--, dressed . beef, .* beef
products, and... lard exported hardly
.equaled the value of the sugar imported.
Even our immense exports of cotton were
only about twice as ; valuable : "as our im
ports Of sugar, while - the barley, oats and
rye, fruits, nuts, hops, vegetable oils, oleo
margarine, butter and cheese, pork and
hams that were exported last year, all put
together, represent in value only two
thirds of the sugar Imported. ..
."' Stated in this way the immensity of our
sugar importations from abroad can be
more fully comprehended' than from a
compilation of statistics. -The consump
tion of sugar in this country is in fact
enormous. It is with our people an - arti
cle of universal daily use and the con
sumption increases with ,-. ihe .growing
prosperity and wealth of the . population.
So long as we do not produce enough for
our needs at home we shall have to. pay
this vast tribute to other lands and sacri
fice our home welfare in doing it.
â  Germany and _ France are making stren
uous efforts to reap the large profits of
this rich American trade, Tbey pay ex
port bounties to their sugar- shippers,
which more than. make up the cost of
freight across the Atlantic and 'offset/the
duty now exactedat our ports. The Amer
ican producer has to compete witn these
bounty-s-_rp ported competitors, and, under
the low tariff system, has found it almost
impossible to pay to the American farmer
a sufficient price for the raw material to
justify him in growing vt. . â¢-â 
â ' The folly of leaving our sugar, industry
unprotected is the greater because it is
one that under right protection could be
carried on in almost alt sections of the
Union.. In California it can be made one
of the most profitable of the products of
our soil. The lublic-spirited enterprise of
Claus Spreckeb has already firmly estab
lished the. industry among us, and iif it is
rightly protected the. benefits: to the State
will be hard to overestimate.
â :.. MINING PROSPECTS.
. The outlook for a large increase in the
mining industry in this State. the com
ing year is very encouraging. The books
are not yet made up , so. that an accurate
statement of the product of 1896 : can be
given, but the gold yield, which is the
most prominent feature of California min
ing, Will probably show an increase over
that of 1896 of nearly two million doliars.
The coinage of the branch Mint here
was the highest .since 1878. The statis
tician of the Slate Mining Bureau esti
mates that the ..yield of all the mineral
products of California. for: the year just,
ended will be $25,000,000. The prospect for
a large increase for the coming 1 year is.
evidenced by the fact, that whereas in
former years it has been the custom for the
owners of mining property to look up the
buyers, now there is so much demand
that the purchasers are hunting for the
property-holders. ..- y .. . ,
Another good augury for the future .of
California mining is the assured confi
deuce displayed in a number of places
throughout the State in- the sinking of
deep mining shafts. It used to be the
custom to make these pay their way as
they went down . by; taking out ore, but
now tbey are being sunk. to depths of from
1000 to 2000 feet without stooping to work,
the ore.- Recent operations by various j
companies in this deep shaft sinking rep
resent outlays of, from $150,000 to $300,000,
and the significance of . bold investments
in these days when mining. is both cautious
and scientific is very clear. â¢ â¢; "
One of the notable features of the in
creasing gold : production is that much of
this increase is due to the reopening of
old mines which had been for years aban
doned as unprofitable. This is a practical
proof of the great improvement in the ]
methods of extraction. The tailings.which
were thrown away, as valueless -by old
fashioned methods are now* being worked
over at a handsome profit. .
â¢ With our gold product increasing at the j
rate of $2;000,000 annually we can consider !
the report from the Mining Bureau as ope j
calculated- to- inspire- confidence- in the I
prosperity -: of the new year. Gold is a
most' potent factor in starting great Indus-, I
tries, which bring occupation, .prosperity
.ana happiness to the ..people. . - Now that it .
is 'being produced in j enlarging, quantities
it gives what is literally a- golden glow to
all the prospects of- tho State.- -.
â¢ " EASTEBN .BANK PAILTJRES: â¢ .-
." The bank failures in the Lake States'.
â¢ constitute the largest cloud. ori the finan- -
cial and.commercial.horizon of the coun-.
try. -Tbeybave-. been serious enough, to
engage the -attention- of all parts of the
- Union, arid id the States where they, have
occurred have occasioned ; a widespread
.distrust which it is not surprising to learn'
is proving .almost as prejudicial as the
failures themselves.
It is wor.h noting that the lack of con
science caused by the failures is confined
almost wholly to persons who are- outside
the higher , circles of commerce' and
finance. Bank presidents and the larger
merchants and manufacturers of the
country ha?-} shown no signs of panic,
but on the contrary have treated the fail
ures as ordinary events in the course of
business and significant of nothing except
mismanagement. _. . '.*'".
; .The judgments of the experienced mas
ters of finance and â¢ commerce are un
doubtedly correct. All the evidence made
publ\c concerning the failures show that
in every instance the failing banks have
been conducted, without regard to good
business methods. 'â¢ Money has been
loaned without good security, and more
over has been advanced- iri amounts ex
ceeding what the capital 'of the banks
justified. Such methods . would : lead to
disaster even under the best conditions,
and it is not to be wondered at that they
have proven disastrous now.
The clear understanding that the fail
ures-have been due to bad management
and other causes that are wliolly local has
prevented any distrust arising in other
portions of the country. There is little or
no danger, of runs on banks outside the
districts which have been already affected.
In fact there is reason for, believing the ,
distrust, there 7 will soon pass : away and
business will move forward with as much
confidence as eyer. - . yy
The one lesson ,to be learned from the
â¢ THE; SAN- 'FRANCISCO CALL, .SATURDAY; JANUARY 2. 1897.
failures is the necessity of better bankin-:
laws and ."more .thorough supervision of
banks in ' the States : where they have oc
curred. This lesson s will .have" its-.effect
when Congress enters upon the work oi
extending -and revising the national bank
law; and "will probably lead the Legisla
tures bfj the ; several States' affected to re
vise their local laws; to some extent.
From the -. failures, therefore", we may ex
pect good .as well as evil results, and the
prospects are that the good will remain
with us long after the evil has been over
come and forgotten. ,,.,-.
y ITOiJIiLAGH'S^DEATH, "
â¢ The circumstances attending the death
of J. B. McCullagh, the- veteran and
famous editor of the St. Louis Globe-Demo
crat, will, have the effect of reviving the
controversy oyer tbe right of a man to kill
himself when life has become an incessant
pain and is of ho further value to the pos
sessor '''"â¢'. : -
Mr. McCullagh was a believer in. the
doctrine of the Stoics. .He was no weak
ling. There was no coward's blood in him.. .
He deserted no apparent duty. He worked
and fought long as there was strength
in him to do. either, and. then not -airing
to linger "superfluous on the stage," and
knowing that his pain aud weakness
would .render him a source of anxiety to
â¢ those whom he -.loved, he ended life "in
. the high Roman fashion, and made death
proud to him."
Whatever -views, one may â¢ take of the
philosophy, of suicide as an. abstract ques
tion..none who have known- McCullagh
either personally or by his wide extended
fame will -reproach bis memory for acting
as he did when â 'â  the; issue "to be or not to
be" came to him for determination. We
could not judge him rightly unless we
knew all the conditions of his life and felt
all the pain.. that racked li is body. These
we do not know and have not felt. We
only know that he had been a strong and
faithful worker for good in America, that
he had broken down at bis labor, that he
longed for rest and went to it the way
and at the time which seemed best to
him. On that record he merits all honor
for his life and the tenderest pity for his
death. -":â¢
â¢-."â ' McCullagh was one of the foremost and
strongest of that. generation which devel
oped out of the stress . and strain of our
civil war the qualities :of heart and brain
which infused a uew force and vigor into,
. American Journalism. The nervous inten
sity of thought and feeling which were
produced, among all classes of people by
the excitements of war affected every in
dustry of the country, but in no kind of
work, were these effects more marked than,
in that of the publication of newspapers.
The change Was radical. In the old days
the news features of a paper were subor
dinatetQ the editorial columns." ...When
the battles came, however, public interest
demanded hews above everything else, and
out of that universal and intense demand
came the newspaper of to-day.
:. A large part of McCullagh's success was
due to his understanding of this new need
of. the time. He gathered the news wher-
: ever it was to be found and at whatever
cost. He was himself a' trained gatherer
of news, having served as a correspondent
j at. the front during the war, and he profited
.by the experience . thus gained -'â â¢ when he
became the editor of a great paper. Jour
nalism, therefore owes much to his exam
ple and his influence, and his fellow
:members in the profession will feel that
in his death tbey have sustained the loss
of a leader whom they can ill afford to
spare. '. '. " -...â¢'â " â -..',

, Believing that there 'are large'numbers of men
who can "really ' think below the surface and
who will do it if once jolted oiit of* the rut
which th.ey go the rounds of their dally activ
ity, I am encouraged to go on trying to break
up their apathy and fix their attention' on cer
tain aspects of publ airs which elude their
observation and leave thep .wholly absorbed
in their own pursuits, that they may not go
on in blind unconsciousness of the subtle but
well-nigh all-powerful influence |at work an
about them which should be clearly under
stood and seriously dealt with by every loyal
citizen. v. v ;_â¢' Â...-.,. ;>y.i>,.
I jim constantly reminded by passing events
of the attitude of just such men when. Lincoln
and Trumbull, Greeley i and ; Seward, Phillips
and SumnSr, Giddings. and Lovejoy, Whlttier
and Lowell, Fremont and all the early Repub
licans strove so bravely to awaken the coun
try to a full consciousness of the ever growing
aggressiveness of the slaveholders' power-, its
increasing victories and its dominance in
every department of the Government, and I
do not forget how these apathetic . men awoke
at : last) and came . tp â  the support of ; these
maligned Republicans, for the clamor against
, them* as | fanatics -and disturbers of business
was just as petulant and persistent as lt is to
day, against. those who insist that the r resent
order of things must be changed or a wor-e
fate with a more, menacing future will pres
ently overtake our country than came : with
the slaveholders' rebellion. :. - :
: Intelligent men neod hardly be 'reminded
that the power which had gained control; of
the Government fn 1856, fe.t comfortably se
cure in its immense advantage apd-confidenfly
counted on the final but sullen surrender, of
these-Republlcan : agitators ana the ultimate
triumph of the Southern aristocracy over the
greasy mechanics and other "mudsills of so
ciety in the North, for the** "business inter
ests" of the North were unitedly opposed 'to
agitation.*'History Tecords the. re:ult. In our
day, as in that day, danger lurks in the apathy
ol business men, who are immersed iv their
own affairs and only ask â¢_ to be . let alone in
trade and that there.shall be no disturbance
in business'; and on. they go, heedless of- the
fact \ that â¢ their . ow.n ; apathy - may .lead, the
money power now in control of our Govern
ment, our corporations, our trusts, our rail
ioids, our telegraphs, our newspapers, our
universities and colleges; our churches and
religious newspapers to go .too far .In placing
burdens and restrictions upon the mudsills of
society, which- will be followed by another re
bellion too disastrous 'to be compared .with
â¢ anything since the French Revolution. â 
The money barons are' now in absolute con
trol of all the industries and avocations of the
mudsills of society. It was an evil day for our
country when these money barons -. wrested
their magna'charta, the "National bank-act,
' from a pTiadt- Congress and Brought the Na
tion-under tribute to their greed. This is none
the less true because so few. men understand
the secret of their power. "'And they have held
sway for a quarter of a century, during which
one, statesman after another has lallen as the
great Daniel Webster fell on the 7th of March,
1850, before the slaveholders' power to be re
warded by political promotion, though in
Webster's case-it came too late for the reward,
and as his great name passed behind a cloud
the * power â  which tempted him to fall was
broken and utterly destroyed.* Lincoln arose
and slavery fell. -.- â _ .- - Â« " . , _
To make good this retrospect and^warning
let me repeat a part of what was published a
few days since in the editorial columns ox a
"Republican paper which has a daily circula
tion ot 200,000 copies with probably a million
readers, the Philadelphia .Item, as to the
power and influence of the "National" bankers
over the industrial and commercial affairs oi
our country. Alter quoting one of the largest
Eastern financial news associations assaying
that "it is noticed that Eastern capital is in
clined to seek investments nearer home,
probably the result of the recent political
campaign, the growth of Populism having
probably revolutionized the Investment field, '
the Item manes these comments: -, ". '
"That is very large news. It is vitally impor
tant news. And the worst of it is that it is a
fact well known to every expert on the street.
It all means this: These money lenders are
now intimidating the West and South. They;
well know their power. They well know that '
industry cannot be carried on except with the
aid of loans of money; that when tbey shut
down on loans business is likewise shut down.
Which means that these money lenders, as
things now are, have our country .by the
throat This power for good or evil is so great,
is so overwhelming in its effects, bringing
starvation and misery to given Idealities, that
a people are unwise to intrust it in any other
bands than their- own organized Gov
ernment, 'â ' and this - is -. the very. A B
C of financial economy. â â¢ It-is : time
that a -Government committee act in be
half of the people inÃtead of the usurers who
now sap the life out of industry to an extent of
probably over .two thousand millions each
year,", and there is more to the same effect. ..' I
ihinn that our money barons have too much
power. i It Is not a good time for ."taking the
Government out of the banking business."

FIELD FOR i ARMERS.
SUPPLYING THE HOME DEMAND FOE BEET SUGAR.
:.' Philadelphia Times.. ', *_.â¢'.--;â¢-â -â¢'_
The people of - the United States consume
upward ol sixty pounds of sugar annually per
capita,. which at the rate of 5 cents per pound
for tbe manufactured product costs the con
sumers': upward of ' $200,000,000. yOf this
amount we produce less than 300,000 tons and
Import In the neighborhood of 2,0*0,000 tons.
That is, we purchase South America, the
West Indies' and the beet-sugar countries six
â  pounds or more of sugar . for every pound we
produce. .What is ' more, the cane sugar pro
duction of the United States cannot be greatly
extended owing to the fact that about all the
.cane sugar producing territory is now under
cultivation. Even if we possessed Cuba we
should still: have to buy sugar from other
countries, as- the largest crop yet produced in
that Island did not exceed 1,000,000 tons.
We should need another Cuba at this rate to
supply our .wants unless we could make two
canes grow where one grows now. * -,
If we would turn our attention to the pro- '
duction of beet sugar, we have the soil and
climate to supply all' our own needs in this
direction without Cuba. Already the world's
production of beet sugar exceeds that of cane
sugar by more than one million tons, but
while' the United States produced, in 1895,
290,000 tons of cane sugar, only 30,000 tons
ot beet sugar were produced. ' The cane sugar
area of the country is fully occupied, but the
beet sugar area has scarcely been entered upon
at all. The ; 4.236,000 tons of beet sugar pro
duced' in 1895 were 'grown in â¢ Germany,
Austria/France, Russia, Belgium," Holland and
Sweden and a few smaller European countries,
and yet in none of these are the conditions of
soil and climate for sugar bee culture superior
to those to be found over a large area of the
United States. ,-...- â¢ \
- Here Is a field for the farmers who have been .
growing more wheat and corn than they could'
sell at a remunerative price. * They would not
need to look abroad for a market for beet
sugar. ' The home demand would; absorb
2,000,000 tons . annually, and until this
amount was exceeded the beet sugar farmers
would have their market at their own doors.
At the low price of 2 cents per pound,' or $40 a'
ton,' this would keep $80,000,000 at home
that are now spent abroad for sugar. As a
matter of fact the country has been paying
more than $100,000,000 annually . for raw
sugar for the last five years, and as we in
crease in population this sum will increase in
a like ratio. Why not occupy this field arid
thus add a most valuable and extensive arti
cle of agricultural production ;to those we
now have? ' * _ *
â¢ â  The 30,000 tons of beet sugar grown in 1895
while a relatively small . amount compared
with, the product of Germany and the other
sugar-growing countries, is sufficient to con
stitute a guaranty of successful sugar culture
when the farmers of the' country , once turn
â¢ their attention to the cultivation .of this
staple. There are now three beet-sugar fac
tories in California, one in Utah, two in Ne
braska, one in New Mexico, a.' small one in
Virginia and one just established in Wiscon
sin. Within this belt, extending from the At
lantic to the Pacific, beet culture is possible,
and when the nine factories now in operation
have been increased In number to twice the
405 factories now in operation in Germany,
the greatest beet-sugar country in the world,
we Â«$ hall only have reached the capacity of j
supplying our own wants in sugar. â¢ â¢ .
There should be 'as -much enterprise, in
genuity and science 'among the farmers of the
United States as among those of any country
in the world, and attention is called' to this
industry as one capable, of .indefinite expan
sion. .Give beet sugar an exhaustive trial. It
â will help to / secure higher prices for corn and
wheat,- besides making us independent of
other countries for our' sugar supply.

LIVELY TIMES IN
THE MILKY WAY
Several Dealers in the Lac

rested.
Dockery Will Make a New- Year
Raid on Various Piaces
y To- Morrow. 7 r
The Board of Health Will Be Sharp
After All Persons Who May
Sell Impure Food
'-. Milk Inspector Dockery will open the
new year with vigorous action against
those who may be concerned in furnishing
impure milk to the public. â¢ To-day he will
swear out warrants for the arrest of a
number of dealers. The following Mr.
Dockery expects to haye; arrested on' a
charge of selling . adulterated; milk: Pro
prietor of the Mill alley Dairy,. corner of
Hyde and O'Farrell streets;; H. Ehle, gro
cery, 1300 Webster street; Silva & Bar
dona, restaurant, '2130 Fillmore street;
Venneboll Brothers/ 1324 Pacific Avenue,
grocers; St. D. Meyer & Co., 1423 Devisa
dero street, grocers; D. W. Bates, 2204 Fill
more street, dairy produce* A. Hartmanh,
17-_ Devisadero street, restaurant.
In addition .- to - this â¢ Mr. Dockery say a â 
that he will swear out warrants upon the '-.
charge of selling milk without a permit
against the following: R. Robohju,' 1162
Golden Gate avenue, grocer; A. Hart
mann, 1722 Devisadeio, and SilVa <$_ Bar
dona, 2130 Fillmore. Nor are these all
against whom warrants will be out, for al;
those who are concerned in selling adul
terated catsups are down on the list also.
Inspector Dockery said yesterday that
all the food-inspection stations are now In
perfect running order. Milk is inspected
day and night at the stations. For fear
milk will be adulterated after the dealers
leave the stations Inspector Dockery and
two assistants are actively at work secur
ing samples of milk from 'hotels and res
taurants. All persons who selL adulter
ated milk are liable to prosecution. An
arrest would promptly put a stop to the
dealer purchasing milk supplies from any
dairy selling what is determined to he an
adulterated article.
â¢ There were gathered in nineteen sam
ples of milk Thursday from various:
sources. An analysis of these samples
will lead to seven arrests, the parties to be
apprehended being those who have been
mentioned in the foregoing, for selling
adulterated - milk, and three for selling
without a permit
According to Mr- Dockery impure and
adulterated foods must run the gauntlet
of inspection that will be rigid and thor
ough, this applying to many articles be
sides milk. The Milk Inspector tests the
milk first when the samples are brought
in and an analysis is also made by Dr.
Wenzel. Then if it is shown that. there
are disease germs Dr. Spence makes an
examination to discover and determine
the bacilli.
. There is no doubt that the Dairymen's
Association will go to the Legislature to
get some laws through, as the result
of the crusade against diseased ' cows,
which has culminated .in the condem
nation to death of many diseased ani
mals. The diseased-cow crusade was
started last spring. The Board of Health
intended to follow up the matter, so Mr.
Dockery says, but the; dairymen made
much complaint and followed this up by.
sending a committee and an attorney to
the board, and it was understood that the
crusade would be suspended until the
Legislature could, have a chance to con
sider the legislation to be proposed by the
dairymen and to. take such action as the
lawgivers may. see lit.
. The probability is that the dairymen,
who have secured data from the Eastern
States, will move for the enactment of a
law similar to â¢ one now in force in the
State of Massachusetts. "That : the mat
ter.may be set square," said Mr. Dockery,
"the Board of' Health intends to approve
of such wholesome measures as the dairy
men may desire to have incorporated into
law and to advocate the . adoption of snch
legislation.. The board does -not intend;
hor do I, to hurt any man's business un
necessarily. The last few years have .sup-
plied abundant demonstration . that tuber-
culosis in human beings â¢' comes from
diseased milk and diseased : .cattle." _"* - : '

Mr. Glaze, who succeeds to the manage

afterward held position of manager of

Some prominent guests, who had long
been at the Baldwin, left tbere about two

PURE PANHANDLE WATER
Artesian Wells and Commodious
Reservoirs Are in
V- ..". Sight. â¢
Lake Honda Water Pronounced to Be
Impure and Unfit lor Domes- " :
;:'" - tic Use... : J " -
If the panhandle residents do not soon
have pure, fresh water for domestic use it
will be their own fault, inasmuch. as .steps
are how being 'â  taken to organize an Ash
bury Heights water company. ;;.â¢
This, action has been brought about by
the Supervisors locating the Pesthouse on
the Almshouse tract, although at the' last
meeting of the Panhandle Improvement
Club resolutions were * introduced request
ing the City Fathers to reconsider the
resolution establishing the building there.
The members of the club, and the res...
dents of the district believe that by con
certed action ' they will be able to induce
the Supervisors to rescind 'the resolution
.passed at the last meeting of the board
providing for the erection of the hospital
on the -tract of land adjoining the Alms
house. They are of the opinion that the
site selected is not suitable for the pur-,
nose, inasmuch as it drains toward Lake
Honda, which â¢ furnishes the - City with
most of -the water used for domestic pur-
poses. ..'.'- .- : .
It is a well-kiiown fact that .Lake Honda
supplies water for nearly one-half of the
families of San Francisco, and that the
water so supplied is the reverse of pure,
healthy water.
The leasohs advanced for this may be
found in the expressions some of- the
prominent members of the Panhandle
Club. At a recent meeting of .this club,
Chairman Salfeld said: â¢ ' ;â¢ 'â .'.. â¢
* "To erect the Petstbouse^on the site se
lected," said he, "means the. pollution of
tbe water used ior domestic purposes by
three-quarters of our residents. Lake
Honda is the great supplying basin of the
City, and if the hospital is erected near it
nothing' is surer than that the water will
become impregnated with the germs of
those most loathsome diseases, leprosy
and smallpox." â¢ .
In addition to these remarks from Dr.
C. D. Salfeld, Major McKinne,* represent- .
ing the Sutro interest, said: y.-. v '\ ..
"The lake Is below the level .-of the , site
and in the course of time there would be a
seepage and drainage from the hospital .to
the lake. In addition to that the westerly
Winds would carry any germs of disease
into tha heart of- ihe City." *. â¢
'] Steps have been taken and offers made
for not only artesian wells but -reservoir
sites,- by which water can be supplied to
the highest points -in this City. '. v. ....*.
At present , the proper ty-o.wners in the
Panhandle and Ashbury Heights districts
are not satisfied with their Waler ; supply.-
They claim that the rates charged are too
high,' considering the quality of -the. water
furnished. In the event of a ; well .being
struck the club members will agree to take
the water if Lt'iifnrnlshed them -as cheaply
as by the Spring Valley Company. In the
event of the Pesthouse being finally

. There are good ; prospects ; that the year
1897 will .bring rare prosperity in Califor-*
nia mining circles. . It is just now becom
ing thoroughly known abroad and in
financial circles that there are better op
portunities for investment beneath the
semi-tropical skies of the Golden" West
than amid the icebergs of Alaska and the
torrid heat and pioneer surroundings of
South Africa. ' . ' " ! '-
Editor Etielson, the Los Angeles mining
expert, has done a great deal to dissemi
nate valuable information about California
mines, but the cold records of banks
have told a more eloquent story to those
who are seeking investments. It is begin
ning to be known that good opportunities
for investment exist, and British capital
in particular is only eager to be sure that
no Yankee bunko game is under way. ;
Professor .Thomas Price, the well
known chemist and assayer, whose ac
quaintance with rich men in the United
Kingdom is very great, is now out of the
City, as he has been for a month past at
frequent intervals, for the purpose of find
ing good investments for foreign capital.
Those who are ; best acquainted with
Professor Price's mission say that he has
a commission that means, much to the
future of gold-mining here; that he repre
sents syndicates whose connections with
foreign capital are. extensive enough to re
sult in great changes to the advantage of
California,* if . their . attention is once en
listed in the right way. , y Â° :>â¢-'..
-Those best acquainted with movements
in mining matters are beginning to under
stand that British capitalists are looking
toward California with more eagerness
than for many years, and that when they
make the purchases they are now after
it will-. not be long before a new era
of rare improvement exists. They are
beginning to see that the South African
mines are far less attractive than those
here, and that the profits will be greater
ln the long run on a fair test. - a

How Football Players, Goi_r sefSj Sportsmen

The defeat of the Butte City ' football
team yesterday was a' surprise .to -the
patrons of football. The invaders contend
that they were not treated properly by the :
Pacific Coast Amateur Athletic Associa
tion,, which preferred professional charge's.
against some of the best players of .'.the
Butte team. *â¢ .-â¢â¢-.' .-' .y "

' . THE ' WHEELMEN. ..'â¢
Bright Prospects for the Trade Dur
. â¢ Ing -the New Year Are Foretold.
There has been little of moment in
cycling circles during t.he -past week. - The
. various committees .having in charge the
. proposed meet at the .Velodrome on Satur
day afternoon, January 16, the proceeds
irom which are to be devoted toward send
ing delegates East to the annual assembly
of the League of American Wheelmen,
are going ahead energetically with their
preparations and .everything points
toward .a successful meet .on ; that day.
Certainly the programme will be unsur
' passed for variety of attractions and if the
weather iii fair a "big crowd should attend;
... . There . are no/club, runs .- called ' nowa
days, and it may have also been noticed
that there are no road races, which were so
common last winter, and- invariably had
"to- be postponed from week to week, ow
ing to rain, until the men cot tired of
training . and were ' generally out of forrh
when the event was finally called. There
are plenty of days during the: spring, sum
mer and fall months without trying to
run these races in winter also, and per
/haps the completion of the Velodrome
has had as much to do.with this lack of
attention- to â¢ road-racing â¢as anything.
."Wheelmen like' to raceâ it Is theirnatural .
sporting instinct Which makes ' this so â
and furnished with a' good track the
miseries of ..a contest on the road, in com
parison, are too apparent to. lure- them.
Riding at full speed over a. rough country
road, full of rocks and ehuckholes, in the
;* blinding dust left by some faster, man
ahead of you, perhaps. to fall and be se
verely bruised, or to finish in about tenth
place and receive as a prize a pair- of elas
tics .hold- up your golf stockings with,,
-is- not what it is cracked up. to be,- as the
.man said of the ice., -A nice smooth track, â¢
.'well- protected ..froin the wind; arid cozy,
dressing-rooms, shower-baths and the like
Jor use -after" the .spin are much more
tempting to the average, racer, .'who, in
spite of his speedy tendencies, likes com
fort, .all the same." â¢â¢"'..-"

tended ' southern trip yesterday: E. E.

Perry, a "prominent deaTer'of Tacoma, is in

.. If the League of American Wheelmen,
.as a whole, will work for good roads this
coming -year -then- cyclists generally will
rise up and praise the L. A. W. and give
it their dollars and- their material aid.
Highway improvement is acknowledged
TO be the greatest work the league has be
fore it, and good, or even fair, road's, are
â¢in such small proportion to the bail ones
in this country that a small beginning in
this direction will give the league a big
. prestige. Chief Consul Potter of the 'New
York division, for instance, who.it was*
generally hoped would succeed -Sterling
. Elliott : as president of the league, has
framed a road-improvement bill; with the
approval and co-operation of the State
Grange officials, and with the combined
influences of the wheelmen and the farm
ers it is confidently believed favorable
legislation will be secured. The work
will be pushed vigorously and no doubt
will be. aided* much by the Good Roads
Congress to be held at Albany "in Febru
ary in conjunction with the National As
sembly oi the-L. A. W_ "This will be an
event of . widespread importance, sihce.
gentlemen prominently 'identified with
highway improvement in all sections of
the United States will be'in attendance.
The barometer of the bicyole trade
which 'shows, with unfailipg exact
ness How the business is . prbgress
' ing is the salesbooks of the prominent
. houses. If the record is larger at this per
iod than during the corresponding-time a
â¢ year back, .then look out for big business
*when the regular season opens. I- have re
cently made inquiries among some of the
" larger dealers here, and '-they foreshadow a
heavy trade, for * 1897." This statement of
course applies only to the firms dealing in
.honest wheels at honest prices. -The buy
ing public is learning to discriminate be
tween a good and a- bad wheel, even if the
one is as nicely : enameled as the. Other,
'They want bicycles built by a house 'of rep
utation, one that .will live 'up to every let
ter of its agreement.. * â¢â¢
* Travelers are -nearly ail out, and there,
â¢are lots of them, and they are taking large
orders. The .tire ' men speak of big con
'â¢Â» tracts for the coming season. The big fac
tories are all running lull blast, some new
'ones are being established,- bid agencies
. are; brightening up and*ne*w ones starting,
and all is-, going merrily .and with a vim
that has hardly been expected. ' The sea
son of 1897 iri the cycle trade is going to be
o a brisk one.
It-depends considerably upon the bicycle
manufacturers whether cycle. racing will
. flourish next season as it has in the past
â¢two years. Since tbe discontinuance of
the .race committee of the Cycle Board' of
Trade there is absolutely no use for manu
facturers to 'attempt tQ-secure' legislation
from the "bands- of -the league, and they
have not asked it. Although rumors have
been spread/ broadcast to the effect that
the makers will support racing teams -in
.1897, there is little foundation a3 yet for
the report; .Doubtless- this matter will be
fully discussed at the next session of tbe
Cycle Board of Trade, - when the senti
ment's of the. manufacturers will be fully
submitted.
In some parts of the country it is a mat
ter of open comment that enthusiasm over
cycle .racing has greatly decreased. For
the solution of this problem many ideas
have been advanced. The most practical is
jirobably the theory that now. that the
masses have take"n to the sport cycling is
not the novelty it was five years ago.
People are not so enthused over' the com
petition as characterized, their favor for
the game a few seasons ago.
. Polo on wheels is the latest fo.rm of ex
ercise iii which tbe Easterners are indulg
ing. The sport requires great nerve and
a thorough command of the wheel. And
in rio.case is a 16-pound mount of suffi
cient strength to 'stand the rough usage
that' is given it.. The. players ride like
mad around the hall, and raixups are as
frequent as in a road race. But it. is excit
ing pastime and mnch enjoyed by those
â  who have associated themselves with it. -
â¢â¢ Isaac P. Potter is out with an ultimatum.
It is tbat he will in no case be a candidate
/or thp office of president of the League of
American Wheelmen. Inasmuch as Mr.
Potter carries the New York delegation of
over fifty votes in the pal.m of his hand it
is wondered to which candidate he will
give suppqrt. Mr. Potter admits that
he promised not to become a candidate
for the office in case the incumbent, Ster
ling Elliott, desired re-election, but it is
. understood he did not promise to support
I Elliott.. As New ; York Sta'te, votes so will
â¢ the election go. and it is presumed that
Morrison of Milwaukee orJCossum of New
Jersey will get -the. plum. It will be a
lively session at . any rate. â¢â¢â  The North
California division has seven delegates
and will probably send four of them and
three proxies, those who will probably go
being R. M. Welch, F. H. Kerrigan,
Robert A. Smith and J.-.E. Alexander. :

so plentiful on the bay a few weeks .ago-
The birds have doubtless traveled south,,
where they will play havoc with the grain

to young grain Some of the hunters
.who shot yesterday on the Alviso marshes

last Sunday while shooting from a "sink:

â¢ The Sportsmen's' Protective Association
will meet in K. of R. B. Hall pii ' Tuesday

relative. to the Davis slough matter : were
received a few days ago from Wesbingtoh :
That the Government will not interfere' in

and if it is obstructed.

' "Bogie" O'Donnell gave Harry Corbett
quite -a surprise a few days ago at Califor
nia City. -A party consisting of O'Doii
nell, Tommy Nolan, E. Heffernan, . L.
Cohen and . Captain McNeil steamed over
to the pleasure resort in the launch Nor
wood. . After catching several colds and a
number of fi.h ".bogie'' challenged'Cor
belt to shoot him a match. In fact,'
O'Donnell Wagered, â  a French din
ner that he could- put* 1 more shot
into a sheet of paper' a certain size at
twenty yards from the shooter than Cor
bett. . Of course, the latter accepted the â¢
challenge instantly ami the party quit,
fishing until the contest was finished. The
".bogie" boy ' beat Corbett badly and the
pooiselier could not understand how the
trick was accomplished until yesterday,
when a friend wrote Corbett to examine
bis. cartridge - the â¢ next lime he " has a
match on hand. O'Donnell had cartridges
prepared for Corbett, which were lotded .
with wheat, and as & consequence Corbett
lost a French dinner and his temper,, and
it is said that-he sold bis newly purchased
gun for 'a song- to O'Donnell, who is still
laughing at the idea" of a polished sport
ing man being done- up in such ah easy
manner. It is rumored that Corbett will
retaliate in the near future by inviting
"Bogie" to a sack and candle snipe shoot..
Possibly the largest moose head that
has ever been seen in this City is at
present in the possession of Mr. Ladd, the
gun merchant. The animal was killed
last year by Mr. Wetherbee, who is fore
man of the Alaska Packers' Association,
on Kussillof River, near Cooks Inlet,
Alaska. The head is an enormous thing,
the . horns measure, forty-one inches in
length, head thirty-two inches, base of
horn nine inches in circumference, width
of horns sixty-five inches from tip. to tip.
Last year a* moose was- killed in. Maine,
the horns of which did not compare with
the Alaskan animal in length or width,
but still some of the Eastern papers made
quite a sensation cutof it. â¢
On. his return, from the North Mr.
Wetherbee received from a Russian hun
ter tbe head Of a musk ox, which is- also
a beautiful specimen. The horns .from
base' to tip are twenty-three inches in
length and the width of horns at bass is
twelve inches. From nose tip to base of
horn is twenty-five inches. Howard Carr,
the celebrated rifle shot, who.- hunted lor
many years in th Arctic, said that he had
never seen a liner specimen.
The moose* is the largest oi the deer
family, and most ungainly in form. . The
head is long and narrow, with eyes small
and sunken; nose long and flexible ar.d
covered with hair with the exception of a
spot between the nostrils; ears very long
and coarse; antlers large and spreading,
broadly, pal mated with numerous sharp
points; neck short and stout and nearly
horizontal, higher at lbe withers than at
the hips... The meat of the moose is good
at any season of the year, and especially
the hump on . its nose, which part of the
animal is highly. prized by epicures. In
describing a moose hunting expedition in
the Rocky Mountains Newton Hibbs, who
was a noted hunter, states that the largest
pair of antlers he had ever seen were taken
from the head of a moose that was killed
in the Teton .Basin, near the head of Snake
River. ; They measured from tip to tip
eight arid a half feet. -
The musk-ox derives its specific name
from the peculiar flavor by which the
meat is tainted. In size the musk-ox is
about two-thirds , that of a bison, and
seems to form a connecting link between
the ox and the sheep families, having
many of the characteristics of each. Un
der his heavy coal of hair 'he musk-ox is
covered with a thick sheeting of soft wool
of the finest' texture and of a light brown
color. The horns, which are large and
broad, are formed somewhat like snow
shovels, and are used in removing the
snow in order to reach their scanty food
during the winter months. Tbe meat of
the animal, although coarse-grained, is
generally; juicy and tender, and the pe
culiar musky flavor' is destroyed to ; a
great extent by dressing the ox as soon as
it is killed.^Â«g^S__^_SÃfi_^S^SSÃSÃ
The animals' range is very, extensive.
They abound on the , northern shores of
Greenland, east and .west, . and on both
sides of Smith Sound and in Arctic Amer
ica from latitude 60 deg. to 83deg. north,
longitude 67 deg. 30 mm. west to near the
Pacific Coast. .- --'.

also, an old-fashioned hourglass through
which the sand slowly trickled. Hour

Near, them was Mr. 'Martin, an expert
chess-player; who handled a telegraph
key and sent the San Francisco moves to
Victoria 'and received the Victoria moves,
which Secretary S. Epstein of the San

the San Francisco moves for the study of
a large number of chess-players who were
present. â¢ C___B-#^JSSS

that there should be ten moves per hour.

What Has Been Discovered With' the
Use of Oxygen in the British Array.
During the Zulu war Dr. GeOrge Stoker,
who served during the campaign as army
surgeon, had an opportunity of observing
the method in which the natives treated
their wounded comrades. He noticed
that they carried them to the highest*
point attainable, and there exposed the
wounds to the purest air and the action of
pure water. This simple remedy was
swift and sure, the worst cases yielding
rapidly under its influence, doubtless the'
healthy state of the blood and tbe ab
stemious lives led by the natives- havine a
good deal -to do **>ith the matter. Dr.
Stoker was led to believe that the. oxygen
cure might be applied to ulcers, burns' and.

wherever a raw surface was exposed to the
air was enormous, but with, the introduce c
â¢tion of antiseptics into the treatment the Â
danger was reduced to a minimum. lodo- .
form has always been the special medium
i for use in the case of ulcers, and it is not
a pleasant one, but it tended to hold the Â»
bacteria -at bay. Now, however. -it has-.:
been noticed that 1 in eases where oxygen
has been applied and where the wound is â
1 healing the progress was marked by the â¢
I presence of common organisms, and that;
I if a relapse occurred, the bacteria ilisa-p-.
peared ;ao that one is led to the conclu-".
elusion.. that a -certain number of thete
living organism's are necessary in the for- .
mation ot new and healthy flesh*-. â¢
In the spring of this-year it was decided ."
to enter upon a wider field- of operations,
and test this experiment ."further, ior it '
must be borne. in mind that as" yet it is
only an experiment, .and â¢ accordingly a â¢
committee of ladies and gentlemen, under
the " presidency of â¢ Baroness . Burdett- â¢:
I Couits, undertook to establish a hospital . â¢
at 35 St. George's square. S. W. The hos- **
pital is small, but if funds are forthcom- â 
ing a larger house could be secured. The,:. .
oxygen used is said to be the first gener
ated in an iron funnel, thence it is
pumped into indiarubber bags, according
to the strength required; the part affected *
is then inclosed fn a wooden box, with a
glass lid, and cased round .with.- oiteilk; a â¢ â¢
tube communicates with the box and the ...
bag, and in this way the oxygen is intro- '
duced into the Box. . Other apparatus are
contrived for the. back, head and other -
parts of the body. ,Â°. "... "Â«. ./*â¢_-.â¢. â¢
â¢ The first effect is the cessation of pain, .â¢
and the healing prop-rties are quickly, -.
discerned. One case of an ulcer of forty
years standing had yielded to the treat- â â¢
ment in three weeks; another- of eighteen
years' in an equally short time, and many
others had a similar tale to tell. . Not one ';
of the least of the virtues of the oxygen is
its deodorizing power. â¢ It has also been .'â 
tried on cases of baldness with the result .'
that the hair grew rapidly, and in a short .".
time was in a normal condition. To what
length curative properties of oxygen â¢ .
may be carried remains to be proved, -but- '
it has at least one advantage, that of ex- .
treme economy, â¢ for, .beyond the coot of '
the oxygen, which, it is said, comes to *
about 2J-*.d for twenty-four hours, there is
-no expense for dressings or medicines. â

MEBKLE'S , PETRIFIED FOOT. '
Uses the Sole for a Whetstone and Gave-.- -
a Toe to the filer* ot This Story. .
â¢' -EL PASO,. Tex , Nov. 15.â A hunting
party 3 from this place, but recently re
turned from an expedition northwest of *
here, tell of the marvelous discovery up in '".
the. mountain regions of ., what seems to be
one of the greatest living wonders. The .
find is nothing more nor less -than a man,
living and apparently in good health, yet _.* .
having one foot completely petrified. The *
tale is a pretty stiff one, and would not be
credited were it not vouched for by gen- _
tlemen of well-known veracity and honor,
who furthermore have an.l are ready to "
exhibit the little ', toe from the -petrified -
foot, which was broken off shortly before 'â¢'
their visit, and which the owner was kind '
enough to give them as a souvenir. â. "*
The man with' the petrified foot is an "
ex-cowboy, Bill Merkle by name, who has '
lived. Ib the mountains nearly twenty.five
years. Up to twenty years ago Me-rkJe '
lived the most active of out foor lives, but
about that time, in trying to get out of the
way of- a stampeding drove, be was thrown
from his horse right in the track of the.
cattle,* the/ herd sweeping on resistlessly .. "
over his prostrate body. When ticked 'up
by. his comrades a few moments later not . Â°
a bruise Was discovered anywhere on his
body, but both bones of the left leg a^- . 'â¢
peared to be broken jusi below the knee. .
Nd" physician was called 0 in, Merkle's
friends merely using the the simple means '
in their power to set, splint and .bandage
the broken limb. * ; *
According to Merkle's account, in an*Â°
incredibly short time, the bones seemed to
be knitting together, but pretty soon it . '
became vident that the texture and color * -
of the flesh below the fracture were Under- -
going a change. Id the course ofa month â¢ 1
it was deemed advisable to remove the j
bandage, when it was discovered that while
the fracture had indeed reunited, the leg ...
below had already begun to. show unmis
takable evidence of hardening. Since then â¢â¢
slowly the process has continued, till now
the entire limb below the break is a com
plete petrifaction. "â¢" â¢.
Strange to relate, Merkle declared there' '
is no pain anywhere in the region of the
old fraoture, and while the- weight of the- *
petrified limb necessarily retard, his prog- â¢
ress, he can stand upon it, artd even take
a few steps, and his general health is "ex
cellent. v.; ... :.."-.'.
_ Of course there is no sensation in the *
petrified member. .It .may be struck,
scratched- or pricked with impunity, ana
lifting the foot across the right knee,
Merkle uses it as a whetstone." sharpening -
knives against the hardened sole. How
ever, if the foot be placed, in the nre a *
sensation of heat is transmitted through
out the. -entire body, becoming painful in
tne immediate neighborhood oftbe old

blossoms spring directly from the large '

is usually produced- from a- cluster of
, nowers. it is,. seven to ten inches long
and shaped like a common Hubbard
squash: It contains five cells, each holding
'five to ten beans. While a-tree will begin
to bear when four, years old, it is quite
tender, and needs careful, nursing, water
ing and protection from cold, wind and
excessive heat. At eight years they come
in full bearing, and live for nearly half a
century. As the trees blossom and fruit

Highly Recommspded by R â¢ â¢
..'ligipus^ Authority.
. -There' will come tothis Ci!y this even-'
ing from Los Angeles a -man wideiy.known
as .the exponent of Christian socialism;
REV. W. D. Pi BLISS, the Learned Exponent. of Christian Socialism.
It is Rev, W. D. P. Bliss, and he comes un- 1
der the auspices of the Brotherhood Of St.
Andrew. . â¢
The reverend gentleman is highly rec
ommended as a ..lecturer on the subject to
Which he devotes his attention, as is evi
denced not only by complimentary no
tices in the religions press, bat references
from such church authorities as Bishop
Huntington of Central Ne^y York, Bishop '
Potter of; the diocese of - New-York,- Rich- â¢
ard T. Ely of the University of Wiscon- .
sin, Dr.. Newton of All Souls' Church,
NeW York, Vida -.D. Bcudder of We.llesley
Col lege. and Walter Rauschenbush, secre
tary of .the Brotherhood of the Kingdom.
Mr. Bliss has evidently made a life-long â¢
study; of 'the, literature -of his favorite
theme. This knowledge manifests itself j
in '.his. volume, entitled "A Handbook of
Socialism." He is considered by Dr. New
ton the greatest exponent of the principle
of Christian socialism in the country. . 'Â
.] At present' Mr. Bliss is a clergyman of
the Protestant Episcopal church. His*
travels, both in America and on the Con
tinent, have been varied and extensive:
He will be beard for the first time in
this City at St. Luke's Protestant Episco
pal Church, corner of , Van Ness avenue
and Clay street, to-morrow morning at 11
o'clock.. During his stay his headquarters
will be the Occidental Hotel. Speaking.
.of the distinguished visitor, Dr. Moreland.
rector of St. Luke's, said: '.'â ' . . "-' â¢*...-,
:, "Bliss is a man who deals â¢ wholly with i
the social side of Christianity. . His labors
to assist the rich and the poor to under
stand each other have been vast, and,. I
may add, fruitful.-' . -' .. â¢â¢', '''
â¢" VThpug-h- born of missionary "parents in-.
Constantinople, he comes of -Yankee stock.
In his travels ho- has' crossed, the ocean
thirteen times. 'â -.' ..' .' .'" â¢ '
:â¢' "He has' become deeply cpnvincedlhat
a new social order is needed and that cb-.
operation 'has. come to take the place of
] core petition.' v This he is advocating -along
purely Christian lines. â¢â¢ ' â ':.â¢-.
"Some time this month he will. return
East -by; way! of Salt Lake City, Denver.
Oniahaand -Kansas City, arid - at all' these-,
piaces will probably deliver a series' of lee
. tures; - The times, . and places of lectures

i i '"I might .add that, the Qrigiri"b.f..the'
Christian -socialist movement is largely
due to Ml". Bliss.- For a long time he -has
been â¢ prominently identified with labor
refori_a- movements,- during the course of
which he .edited the Dawn and then the
American ' Fabian.: Both these are edited
infavor of educational and institutional
Christian socialism." .- ;. .

A QUEER MAINE COMMUNITY.
Happy and Prosperous Without Schools,
. Law, Theology, Medicine or Taxes.' :
: Residents. Maine who look to the New
York and Boston . papers : for accounts of
queer people and strange 'forms of govern
ment in different parts of the world could
learn * facts worth studying ". by * coming
here. The settlements ol Eskimos, on the
coast .of Greenland, have their old men,
the tribes of Africa their chiefs and even
penal colonies recognize : the authority of
firearms and the.lash. Here the law-abid
ing people feel but one powerâ the hurry
ing, " unsympathetic ears, which : bring
every think t_hat "comes to their homes ana '
â¢take away everything that goes out.
â The distance from -Milnocket Bridge,
which ) crosses 'the west- branch v cast of
here,' to Perkins' Siding, which is 'three
miles west, is five miles as the J railroad
runs. or the. crow flies. At and ,; Between
these two points. are -five settlements of
new logand .board structures, comprising
about; forty ? building -' in all. '.-; Of these
one is a railroad station, one is a .mail
store, two are small hotel.-, ; v one is a
sawmill, six are '.-' good-sized ''sporting
camps, eight are frame houses with: shin
gles and clapboards on- them, and the rest
are primitive Jog cabins, with splits! for
roofing. * spotted poles for floors ' and
bough- for bedding. /_ â  > ':_ â¢
One-half of' ; the; male inhabitants : are
either guides or lumbermen, partly both,
one quarter ;are?millhands who saw spool
bars and dowels at .Perkins' Siding, and
the remainder. are section-bands and other
employes who work for the Bangor and
' Aroostook 1 Railroad. â¢, Though I no ; census
was ever taken of the place, . there - are
about 200 people who live, here the year
round. Anions- -them are some 25 women
and nearly 40 children. This is when the
population is : at low ebb. ; In July, when
the West Branch drive comes down/ the
population swells to 400 or' 500,' and after
open season for big game begins it often
reaches 1000 souls, besides Indians. ' ,
Having" grown without governmental
restraint from one log camp to its present
proportions : inside of three years, Nor
cro-s has made itself the most anomalous
community oil earth. It is. not a town.
It is not even- a plantation. On the -old
survey maps it is named Indian- town
ship No. 3, so called' by the surveyors to
distinguish it from. Indian townships
.Nos." 1 and 2. The name; of Norcross. sig
nifies nothing. It was so called in order
to locate a station for .a- railroad and a
postoffice for -the hunter?. *â¦ ,
Though, property that cost $500,000 is
here and visible, the Assessor and. Tax
Coileetor never visit the place.' The chil-
dreii are born and grow up without seeing
tlie inside or the outside of a schoolhouse.
There are not two rods of bicycle and not
twenty rods of cart roads in Che whole
township.- As the nearest clergyman",
lawyer â¢ and . doctor are from thirty I
to fifty miles away, -'the people get 1
along very well without them. When a
couple want Jo get married they take their ,
bridal tour in huntine up a minister and .!
: coming home again. : If a person is sick he ,
is sent out tqa.doctor, .because no- physi
cian can be coaxed to come and see him,
and, in case, he dies.the body must" De
transported more than tnirty miles before
it can rest in a Christian burying ground".
There is no drugstore, dance hall arid
no' barroom or other, place where .1 quor is
sold in the towrt'sbin. If two or more men
have a dispute which . leads to" a free, fight,
the non-combatants stand by', to see fair
play, without attempting to interfere. In ;
case the defeated party feels' himself '
rouge and] wants 'to take the matter
into' court, he. cannot afford* to do so, be- j
cause lie would have to. travel nearly all
day by rail ore he could find a magis- .
trate. .. â¢'. * "'â 'â â¢ .
liven the Game Wardens who arrest
men for killing deer spend more - money
in taking their prisoners to court than the
fines! amount to wben. a conviction -is se- j
cured. Once in 'it._rhi.tory, when a 1 mur
der was committed- near here, a Sheriff
from Dover spent a week in reaching here
and getting back home. The chances are ;
it- would.-take something bigger than a
m. Order to bring him here again.
The person wuo reads .this, description
of Norcross and thinks 1 lie 'inhabitants
are degraded, or immoral will make : a
great mistake." A mail four times a day
brings 'letters and papers from every
where, An enrerprising and considerate
. railroad carries away all the people have
to sell and brings in all they buy. "D.vine-
Providence does the rest. The men are
â¢ industrious and moral. The women are

that on a metal rail a horse can draw 'one

â¢as on Belgian- blocks, nine times as mu.ch

opening kl'ck-cff, and appears at the top of the diagram. Succeeding klcks-off from the center

appears. By the. aid of the explanation on the chart the pays may all bo -readily followed. â¢
powerlu', mature men oppose each other.
The hundreds, almost thousands, of peo
, ple kt that came to witness, the' match were
delighted with the style of play, and. when
Olympic scored the first touchdown and
gave promise of overpowering the meh
from Montana local pride rose and knew
_ no bounds. . From that moment the game
had an added interest for Califomiaps. \ â¢
lt was not strictly a football crowd. It
was a holiday crowd, but what it- may not
have known aoout the finer points of the
game it made up for in wild applause at
the more evident spectacular features.'
. Nearly all the available player* of both
teams took part in the contest at differ Â»nt
stages in the game. " Stickney was the
first man compelled to give way to a sub
stitute. All the Butte men had it in for
Stickney because he bad -pobliciy de
clared that they played.^ an ignorant,
massy game. One of the "Butte, players
collided hard with Stickney; just as he had
punted in returning the -stcond feickqff.
The imp: was so great that Stick.icy lay
for some moments almost motionless and -
at the exp. ration of time had to be borne
from the field, though still game and
â pleading to be retained. â¢ ..
Big Felton Taylor, a football player of
other days, look Siickney's place as full
back. The Olympics began the' terrific
line-bucking for which Taylor is alone re
markable as a football player. With ter
rific force, time and time again he rushed
bead-on into the Butte line and always
gained ground, Lv that single style of
playing Taylor, as of old. proved himself a
bucking back of mncb ability, but a foot
ball player of few other qualifications.
Late in the first half Searight of Olym
pic was ruled off for having savagely
tackled and thrown Benson, who was in
teriering for Dygert. _ His place at left half
went to Porter, who dropped, back from,
tackle, while Pete Smith took Porter's
place at tackle and gave his own place at
guard up to Erskine who then came 'into
the game for the first time. ,Y.
But Erskino did not stay long. Back
.Smith went to his old place and Porter to
bis in order to create a vacancy behind the
line for Thierkauf, .who went in where
Searigbt and Porter had. been play in*.
Butte did not make so many changes.

delayed .the Christmas-game, was relieved ,
during the .'ecohd'-half by the giant red- :
headed Butte captain. -When the spec
tators saw' the great lellow stripping off his
sweater preparatory- taking a hand in
the game the crowd applauded, and as tne
giant strode toward his men every "one ex
pected new-life." would be put into Butte
and that likely' the tide of battle might
turn. ; "'â '_â¢ â  â  .
Hooper took his place next to the giant
fair-haired Hal). "They 'were a picturesque
I pair, both by far the tallest and heaviest
j men 'on , the field. . But Olympic very
widely directed her play's against tlie other
side of the Butte line, until, awaiting a
favorable moment, Morse dashed past big
Hooper, dodged several ; men, and pro
tected by the interference of Thierkauf
and Code made the last touchdown" of the
game. . ' _ .
"Soon after that Hooper, still stiff and
sore from his rheumatism, was compelled
to retire. "Bob -Perbara steppea into the
vacant tackle position and little "Mickey"
Harrington took Perham's place at end.
, The first touchdown of the gain* re
sulted indirectly from a blocked, kick, on
which Olympic got possession of the ball
on Butte's ten-yard line after the ball had
been oscillating back and forth across
Butte's side of the field. A few rushes
through tackle soon put it over the line.
The second touchdown was . much more
of a surprise and came alter one of the
prettiest plays of the -season. The ball
had, after the second kick-off, been mov
ing forward and back in Olympic terri
tory. Suddenly, just, after a down near
Olympic's fifty-yard line, Code executed a
quarterback kick,', and \ though- the ball
went almost directly forward Nolan got
under it on the run, caught it -neatly and
sprinted straight -down the field, evaded
Laswell, the only man between him and
goal and, assisted --in the last few yards by
Morse, went, stumbling and sprawling
oyer the line directly- between the.gpal;
posts. ..It was the. most profitable quarter-
back kick ever made on the coast. . â¢'. â¢
The next touchdown. was the one "made
by ' Butte and 'it was hard-earned and
twice almost forfeited before it was finally
secured. After steadily bucking the ball
for ei'ehty-five yards with â¢ once losing
possession Butte carried it aver the line,
but had to give it up on a decision made
on the * play preceding the final plunge.
It. was only a few moments,- however,
until Butte regained. the "ball on a costly
attempted quarter- back kick by Code.
But on * a miscarried? fake play Butte
almost lost the ball .again. Uig "Hall had
dropped back for guard's position as if to
come at the line like a. human pile-driver.
Naturally the Olympics expected 'him to
buck. It was only a bluff '.to bide 'a
quarter-back kick .to' the end. .'. , '"'
The' kick was a failure, for if brought a
loss oJ several yards', and Butte â¢ barely
got the ball after it was juggled- overhead
by both sides in a' wild, scrimmage' for its
possession.' "In. six buck, by Dygert alone,
Butte then scored it's only touchdown.
Laswell, like.Morse, reputed td be a sure
goal-kicker, alao failed of bis ' reputation
.on New Year's day. .-â¢â "â¢ >
In tlie second half; Olympic scored after
bucking the ball almost from the center of
the field. From that time on, honors were
about evenly divided. At first Butte
worked the ball down to within six yards
of goal and there lost it on downs. The
best play of the series in this particular
advance- a quarterback kick by Benson
to. Laswell, that came near being a repe
tition of Code l s kick to Nolan. It netted
a good gain of twenty-six yard's.
; The game enaed with the Olympic
slowly working across Butte territory. As
ihe final whistle' sounded the Olympic
team gave a great cheer for the- Butte
players and hundreds of delighted citizens
swarmed upon the field and overwhelmed
the members of the home tealn with con
gratulations. : Morse was the recipient of
the .most attention, though all. the men
came in for their share. .'
About the Butte men as they quietly
moved toward the' exit were the enthusi
astic Butte women who had sat in- a little
group in" the grand stand during the con
test and yelled themselves hoarse iv re
peatedly applauding and urgfng on the
Montana players.
The game was 'to have . begun at 2:30,
but the 'two team* were no sooner on the
field than a parley began over the old
score -of professional ishi anions the Buttes.
'tor nearly an hour the â¢good-natured
crowd waited uncomplainingly, for it knew
that when ; oirce the game did begin tbere
would cc a contest. ; After repeated threats
on - the part .of :' both â  teams .to leaye . the'
field it was fi _*â  ally agreed, at Butte's â¢. sug
gestion, that the (natch game be declared
-off. as Butte would not play 'unless with
its best team, and that then an exhibi
tion, a. mere innocent practice game be

played, .so that the alleged professionals
might participate without injuring the
standing of the amateurs.
. With ihis'un'derstanding the match' was
declared off, the -rate receipts declared" for
charity and the- practice game began in
earnest and continued with unabated fury
ior an hour and a half.
The only serious drawback to the exhibi
tion was the tedious delays breaking in
upon the fast dashes.
Butte was not so good as on Christmas,
while Olympic played much better.

A STANFORD- VETERAN.
Code Thinks the Olympics . Have
â¢ Profited by .Former Experience. '
. When last we played against Butte and
were defeated we made .the mistake of
underestimating our opponents. We
were overconfident and thought that we
were going .to win easily. Two of our
men didn't know tbe signals properly and
that fact served to mix us a little; Then
Stickney changed with one of the other
halves and that mixed us some more. -
The team on this occasion was the same
as bef ore. with the exception of Nolan,
who proved a splendid acquisition to the
end, which he never allowed the Buttes to
get round. Our former experience taught
us a lesson. We were on to our oppo
nents' style of playing, and, of course,
were prepare- to counteract it. We
checked their rushes by getting down low.
We made up our minds to win and started
in with and maintained to the end snappy,
dashing and good fast playing. Putting
Hcbbs in for guard and Sheehy for tackle
strengthened tbe team, and Felton Tay
lor as fullback is without, a peer for back
ing the line,- especially .if given proper
support. - :;,'â '
i Every man on the team played good,
hard ball arid was in every play. If we
had 'put up 'a "similar play when we en
countered Butte bri- Christmas we would
undoubtedly haye won. Our interference
was also good, fast .and .'equal, and the
play all round was clean and gentle
manly. ' . ...'...
' The Buttes put up much the same
game as before, but' this, wii ile quick and
snappy, was weakened by -their inability
to run - round* the ends and their conse
quent- dependence upou bucking tactics.
They were, perhaps, strengthened for the
time being by Hooper, who played a fine
game. ; . *'*.."
li i_f satisfactory to know that we
neVer lost the ball on downs, but invari
ably made our live yards. ,When the ball
did escape, us it Wa_T usually due to an
oversight or a foul. -The catch made by
Nolan- frond-, a .quarter-back kicK was
special feature of the, game. Thierkauf
deserves the thanks- of the team .or
coming in at the last moment and taking
STJawright's place. * ( The officials were all
right and their decisions very fair.

THE 'TEAM WAS DIVIDED.
Benson Says a few Words on tho
" Question of Professionalism.
I would like to set myself and the team
right with reference to" the position we
took in the case of Hall and Laswell, who
were objected to on the score of profes
sionalism. -The Olympic Club sent us an
offer,. without solicitation on our" part, to
come to this* City and play two. games.
At that time, too, we had played quite a
number of p.atches and our men. were
fairly well 'known. The Olympic mana
gers^- will not say all,- but certainly some
â were cognizant before we. left Butte of
the fact that the question of professional
ism was to be brought ud in the case I
have mentioned above. -In spite of this,
' however,.' they -'allowed ns to leave Butte
without a hint as .to 'what. was ip store for
' ns, which -cam. altogether as a surprise to
me and the rest .of the ''players. Conse-,
â¢ quel. alter thinking the matter over,
we decided; rather than go into .the field
.â¢"with a weakened; team, to . refuse to play
at aH. The end of the difficulty was that
the Olympics Â©greed to- our' proposition
that, tire game should be an exhibition
one. and that the proceeds s'houla go to
â charity. ' â¢ . ' â¢
As regards the game -itself, I must say
that" w!e" were 'beaten fairly and squarely.
With the. exceptiqn of two men viz.:.
Hall and" Slater there was not a member
of ; the B.utte. team who played'the game,
-of . w.hich . he is really capable. The
â Olympics,* on the other, hand, played a
good, fast, shappy came. Their interfer
ence was good and they bucked the line
fiercely, With what *res,nlt the score shows.
Nevertheless I do not : think ?. that they
could do : it : again' but this, of -course, is
merely idle talk. The' sudden change to
the life of a big city, with all it*) pleasure
and variety, had a deteriorating effect
upon our team, and not only that, but the
trouble which we had gone through over
the question of -professionalism . had di
vided us considerably and robbed us of
much of our, spirit. - : , Let me add that I do
not say.this in belittlement of the work of
the Olympics, but. merely.: because I. am
convinced, as I said before, that we did
not play -anything like .the came of ; which

ENDED IN A KICK.
A Dispute Puts a -Mop to a Hot Foot
ball Contest Between Coin
. . pan ie-. A and B. â¢
The football game between Company A
and Company B ' of the League of the
Cross at Central Park yesterday morning
.ended in a dispute.
In the second half the Company A boys,
by repeated bucking of their opponents'
line, brought the ball down to B's five
yard line. The ball was then' passed, to
the quarter, and before he had a chance to
give it to the backs B's men broke through
and the ball was fumbled.
When the players arose it was seen that
-Drady was on the ball and had advanced
it three yards. The captain of -B's team
objected to this and Releree Hobbs, after
consideration, awarded the ball to Com
pany B. Captain Mogan, being dis- :
satisfied- with this decision, ordered his
men off the field and refused- to continue
the game. < . Â â¢
But for this incident the game would
have been an exceedingly good one, as
both teams are evenly matched.
The game being a charity ore, a large
crowd was present. The sympathizers of
both teams were out in force, and. armed
with instruments of all kinds to make a
noise, they kept up a lively racket. The
California State Band was present and
during tbe game piayed excellent music.
. In the first half -the ball, after being
kicked off, was brought back to nearly
the center of the gridiron. â¢
On the next line-up Mogan made a
pretty run of twenty yards before being
downed. On a fumble "B" got the
ball and on play being resumed the bail
was passed to Zan, who made a beautiful
run from theiorty-tive yard line, with good
interference, and made a touchdown. Mr.
Hobbs decided that Zan had gone in
touch on the thirty-yard line, and the ball
Was brought back. There was a great
howl from the "B ' contingent, but Eugene
Sheehy, the Olympic tackle, who was act
ing as their concn, seeing the justice of
the decision, had his men continue. Fan
ning then made a long run, with good in
terference, and reached the five-yard line
before being tackled. Company B then
lost the ball on a fumble and* Brignole
kicked for fifteen yards, and "B" worked
it down to "A's" ten-yard line, when the
ball was lost on downs.
.Brignole then made a run of fifteen
around "BVend, and was heavily tackled
and hurt, causing a d -lay. .< The ball was
then carried back and fourtb, and at the
end of the first' half the ball wag in the
center of the field. : Â«
In the second half Brignole kicked off
to the 25-ycrd line, and the ball was
returned ten yards. "B" then lost on
downs. ."A, ".by repeated bucking, rushed
the ball down to "B's" 5-yard line. On
line-up Brosman passed tbe ball to Dsady,
ana before he had a chance to pass "B's".
men broke through and. the hall w_s
fumbled, but was regained by Drady.
Here a dispute arose as to whether a for
ward pass had been . made, and Umnire
Hobbs decided that such a pass had been
made, and the ball was given to "B" on
: their own 5-yard line.. ,
Company A, seeing bow near they were
to a touchdown, became angered and left
the "field, refusing to play. Hobbs then
awarded the game to Company B. Score,
,lltoO.
When seen after the game Captain
Mogan of Company A's team said : "We
were three yards from the goal and we
were forced to give up the ball on a for
ward pass that Hobbs said be never saw.
I saw the ball given and it was not a for
ward . pass, and we declined to play on
account of his favoritism."
When told what Captain Mogan had de
cided, Mr. Hobbs said: :v "They charge me
with -favoring: Company B, but I do not
see what reason they have for doing so.
If he-will remember, in the first half I
.called Zan" back after he had made a
'touchdown* and my decision tben was. that
he had. gone in-touch, and if I had been in
favor of B I would not have decided that
way. -As to the forward pass, I saw the
quarter make it* and thought it ray duty
to rule as I did." .

To the Sporting Editor of the] Callâ Dear Sir:
Owing to an unjust and illegal decision by
Umpire Hobbs ot the.Olympic Club the game
at Central Park yesterday beiween Companies
A and B, L.'C. C, terminated in a very unsat
isfactory manner. 'rHi-y.
; Company A had the ball within three yards
of B's goal, and on a fumble; Hobbs declared ; a
forward; pass by/A,: no claim of suchvbelng
'made by B, since such ; a. pass , did , not and
could not occur. 'Being* unjustly denied a
well-earned touchdown in. this manner, no â¢
honorable option was left to Company A's team
bht to retire from the game. Mr. Deming of
Hoitt's Academy, linesman on the occasion of
the game, and Mr. Lipman, who acted as ref
eree/ iniormed me that > such a pass did not
and could not occur, they being in a position
to see such. ..-. _â¢...-. .
By publishing" this you will confer a favor on

SUTRO HAS HAD
HIS EXPERIENCE
. '
He Is Very Glad to Lay
Down the Mayor
. ally.
A Little Puzzled How to Act
' in Face ol "Two Sets of
Supervisors. .
Makes' Some Suggestions Looking to
â  a Better and Cheaper City
Government.
Mayor Sutro entertained ;a l number of
friends at the Heights yesterday in a very
â¢ genial frame of mind. He is luxuriating
in the . thought of being soon released
from the annoyance of "office"â ; stand
ing powerless at the head of i the Govern
ment of this' City." . .' , r .
"I shall be done with it on Tuesday
afternoon," he said, "and right glad I am \
of it I shall prepare a. little message,' in ,
which. I shall make .what recommenda
tions seem to me proper. '-. ',',.
The Mayor is puzzled* a little as to what
to do in the event of there being two
claimants for each of the supervisorial
.chairs, as there probably, will be. The
usual custom is - for' the 'member* the |
old board to rise up, giving their places tp j
I the newcomers,: whereupon' the- retiring
Mayor, having made ' his little speech, va
cates his .own chair and introduces the
new Mayor to the new board. v";c_:
But where the old board shall -refuse to
rise up and do any such .thing, Mayor
Sutro is at a loss as to the matter of form
there being no precedent for such a situ
ation. He says he will do what is always
none in such case, ask advice from Clerk
Russell. In any case seats will be pro
vided for allcomers. .
"What have I accomplished as Mayor?"
said Mr. Sutro, reverting to the retrospect
ive again;., "very little. The Mayor is
littie more than a figurehead. MwÃj
"I could, of course, have done much lf
I bad had the board with me, but with
that body opposeo to him no executive of
this City can do anything. I have stopped
some legislation that might have worked'
mischief, but for the most ' part tbe ordi
nances that I saw fit to veto were passed
by the two- thirds vote over my head.
, "As to the matter of the new charter, .it
is a very important document and should
not be rushed through in a hurry. It
should be drawn carefully and have the
benefit of the best thought and the most
careful inquiry into the system of munici
pal government in the great cities of the
world. For instance, the attention of all
students of municipal government is being
attracted to Glasgow just now, where the
municipal ownership and conduct-or-op
eration of all those things of public .com
fort; convenience ' or necessity, such as
water, light, transportation, etc., . are
shown to be a great success."
"The idea of the citizens of a great city
paying a private* corporation for the
water they drink and allowing them to fix
such prices, too, -as shall net the company
a profit of a million a year! We should
have better water, better light, afid better
streetcar service all at a fraction of- what,
these things cost us now. If it is so in
Glasgow, why should it not be so here?
The new; charier might provide for . the
working out of such a plan.
"We should have better ; superintend
ence, too, of public work. You have no.
idea of the poor work that is done in
almost every department of- the public
service. I -could take the contracts for
street work .at half the price realized- by
contractors . and give the people better
work. Especially is this true as to bitum
inous rock work. The concrete laid under
the ' bituminous rock is- generally very
faulty.
"The supplies to our institutions-^the*
jails, hospitals, etc.â are generally of very
poor quality. This City is ' simply- a big
business affair a- big corporationâ and
should be conducted as such. It needs"
honest business men to. look after it in
stead of mere politicians. . With- such in.
the conduct of affairs. great improvements
and great savings might be- made. '..
"As for myself,'' said the Mayor, "I
have generally .been supcessful in my. Un
dertakings 'through my life, but. this ,
thing of the Mayoral ty,T . must cortfess,
proved unmanageable; I could "'do little
â¢with it. I nave alw-ays been master .of the
situation ; I have always had a number of
men under my efn ploy, '"and they did irs I
told them. T couid not manage the poli
ticians." â -â .â â * 'â ; '.-â -. ''â¢'.â â¢ ' .
Speaking of the funding biif, Mr. Sutro.
said : ; "It would be ; a} bold', statement to
say that it will' not pass. â¢ Huntington is a
very shrewd man. I learn- that he is very
confident. Many of --the" Congressmen are
retiring with .his session and they may
become careless - what, they "do. Bills of
this character are rushed ; through at the
end of a session. .Why Cleveland has not
begun proceedings in foreclosure I do not
understand. The time has run out. The
proceedings should be under way-" -'-â  â  â¢'-.â¢

paper duties which so much hampered

the present century will shortly come up
for sale at a London" auction-room. It is
the first number ?of Berthola's Political
Handkerchief, being a news sheet printed
on cotton fabric instead of paper, the idea
being to evade the paper duty." It is dated
London, âi Saturday,*, September J -: 3. , 1831,
price 4d, and the letter-press, which. is
fairly ... legible, i is as ' remarkable >as the
material on which it is printed. The tone
of this news rag is intensely, Radical, but
it reproduces the order of ceremonial to
be? observed at the .' coronation of King
William IV and Queen Adelaide on the
following Thursday, and it is announced
that _ a proclamation to i the^people of
Europe will appear in our "next cotton."
It is embellished with a medallion wood
cut of Napoleon the Alps, but the
ink in this pictorial effort was too much
for the cotton and H. the Alps are ;in a fog

â¢ Explanation. -.
â¢ The arrow -flies with tbe wind. The top ttgaiea '
st station Indicate maximum temperature for the ',
aara; those underneath It. If any, the amount of >
rainfall, of melted snow in Inches and hundredths, I
during the past twelve hours. Jso bars, or solid 1
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso-' I
: therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature.- The |
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
II usually accomDanled by fall weather: "low" j
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded I
and accompanied by : cloudy weather and rains. j
"Lows" si ally first appear on tbe Washington !
coast: When the. pressure is high in thÂ« interior i
and low along t the coast, and the Isobars extend !
north and south along the coast; rain ls probable; . i
but when the "low" is .Inclosed- with Isobars of I
marked-curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Improb
able. With a "high" In the vicinity of .Idaho, and
the pressure falllhg to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected* In- summer and' colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these Conditions
â¢111 produce an opposite result. - . â¢ â¢-â  . -

demanded the adoption of. some measure
which would leave no doubt on that score.
The Board of Health" of this city is the
lirst to 'find and adopt a test that is iafal
lible.
The idea was suggested by Dr. Lubbock,
acting Health Officer, and City Veteri
narian Carpenter readily put the sugges
tion into practice. It is for the use of
ca__iie condemned' because affected with
tuberculosis and meats condemned found
in t_>- markets. * '
â¢ A lon of common kerosene is pumped
into the carotid artery after killing, by
means .of a Davis pump. â  This reaches
every part ofthe animal and so taints the
meat that neither man nor beast will touch
it. .If poor meat is found in the markets
a. quantity of coal oil sufficient, for the
purpose is injected. ' â¢ â¢
1 "This hew departure. is absolutely sure
against the- -use. of the carcass for food,"
said Dr. Carpenter to a Call representa
tive, "and.it renders the whole beef anti
septic for all ordinary purposes. No car
cass permeated with coal oil is tit for any
purpose but as a fertilizer. The idea is a

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY ... 2, 1897.
OAKLAND'S HOPE
FOR NINETY-SEVEN
Nothing Else Is Needed bnt
a Free Water
Front.
With a Clear Title Nothing Can
Hinder an Increased
Commerce.
An Example, of What May Be Ex
peeled Has Been Recently / .
Furnished.
' ' Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,') .
908 Broadway, Jan. 1. J
The prosperity of the year 1897, so far as
Oakland is concerned, depends entirely
upon tbe fate of her water front. The past
year has furnished a remarkable example
of what can be done in the way of devel
oping commerce by improving the water
front A few months ago a new wharf and
bunkers were opened at the foot of Oak
street, and .that locality has been - the
busiest marine commercial scene in the
estuary since that time. *
"L * a ***^ V ,****. MUl_
Following close upon the opening of the
Adams wharf the necessity for an imme
diate increase of wharfage facilities was '
noted and more contracts were let, which
are now being carried out. These improve-'
ments, however, are an infinitesimal por
tion of what would be done if the title to
the whole, water front were hut as clear as
to that portion of it bordering. on the
Adams .state. â¢
With the closing day of the. old. year
came the gratifying' news from "Washing- .
ton that the Secretary of "War had ordered
the recommencement of work on. the har
bor improvements, which means that the
recommendations of Colonel Suter will be
carried out.. The . money to be thus speiit
will materially improve the channel, and
will eventually â¢ lead to. the cutting
through and -opening of â¢' the tidal canal.
But even when. this is done unless title to
the many miles of water front-be decid.d '
the full extent, of its . benefits' cannot be
obtained..- y ': â¢
"Within the past week the first vessel to
come to Oakland without having the .
Custom-house seals broken was docked
at the new wharves, and now that Oak- .
land has been declared a port -of- entry and
all classes of vessels can come here to dis- '
charge cargoes, and . take â in ballast with- -
out the necessity- of: crossing the bay,
there is every reason to look for increased
commerce. People. who profess- to "know
declare openly that within a few months
Oakland and Corral Hollow, which "is al
ready Connected by tail with Stockton,
will be ' joined:. by a steam road; "When
such a. road is bu.ilt.it is equally certain
that large quantities of grain grown in the
San Joaquip' Valley .'will be shipped direct
to Oakland and there loaded into deep
water vessels. The. future, possibility of
such enterprise cannot be overestimated.
All this, however, depends solely on the
freedom. of the water front.*'. With condi
tions such as have existed for forty . years
the harbor shores will continue to be frog
ponds and marches and Oakland | will be
found at the close 0.f, 1897 no farther ahead
than at the close of 1896. Oakland's fate
for 1897 now rests with the Supreme Court.
There.is a growing probability that . the
developments at Emeryville which were so
j suddenly terminated about two years ago
I .will soon-be resumed. The great realty
and streetcar syndicates, which are con
trolled by F. M. Smith of borax fame and
his. millions, are noW passing through a
system .of reorganization so as. to make
them dividend- properties. It has
always been Mr. Smith's idea to make his
Emeryville property a central point for
streetcar lines on this side of the bay and
from the pier which is already built there
to run a ferry system to San Francisco.
Rev. Dr. Bentley.
Â: BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. I.â Trinity Methodist Church;; is again to the front
with tales of discord arid it is whispered that the .organization of ; E. a. Girvin's :
Church of the Nazarene may be the signal for .fat large number of withdrawals.
For over a year there have been constant rumors of > trouble in the church, grow
ing out of the defection "of â¢ Mr. Girvin, who was leader of the ; Bible class and a
very prominent member, and out of the actions of the "Holiness Band," an or
ganization of young people which came into existence during Dr. Be ri tley' s "ab
sence in Europe. The "Holiness Band" is composed of s agitators for "entire con
secration," and its meetings aroused opposition from the tirst, when young
Parkhurst 'and ,'Payzant, two university students,' 'were/ induced * to leave their
studies and give themselves . up; to religions work. ;. 'Payzant*, went to Guatemala
and Parkhurst, with a brother and companions," made an evangelistic tour of
California towns. : Now Parkhurst : is; back, sand'during5 and 'during ; the. past few weeks has
been an active participant in the "Holiness. Band's" meetings. On several occa
sions the latter has held opposition meetings in the lower auditorium of the
church while the regular Sunday services were in progress above.
â  Dr. Bentley, the pastor of the church, who Is now in third year of his pas
torate, has declined to take any part: in the much-taltted-of dissensions. On his
return from - Europe Dr. Bentley did not , very enthusiastically encourage the
"Holiness Band," which he :: found flourishing, and J its membership considerably
decreased. ; Dr. Bentley is : a close friend of Mr/Girviniri'spito of theological dif
ferences, and many members of the church declare that -he is deserving of much
credit for patience with both sides of the dispute.
This was abandoned when he went to
Europe to 'raise money by placing borax
stock on British markets. : He did this
successfully and is now back in local har
ness, and as be is a man of remarkable en
ergy it is not likely that he will longer al
low the valuable pier Emeryville to
remain idle. '.:.-.", ,â .*â ,..:'â '.â _ â¢:"/-.'...
WORK FOR STUDENTS.
Effort to Have the Work '.ot Publishing
' the University Paper and Magazines
- Done by Students.
I.'- BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. The- direc
tors and' managers of the various student
journals published at the university are
endeavoring to secure a printing office of
their own for ' use in the; publication of
their paper's. 'i They have interested Presi
dent Kellogg in the scheme and a strong
effort will be made to obtain the necessary
material, as the plan would be .of great
benefit to students. '
There are three journals published at
the university which would be printed in
the new office. .They are the Daily Berke
'leyan, Weekly Occident an J University of
California Monthly Magazine. All of
theseare now printed in outside offices,
and the expense of having the work done
amounts to a sam that would help bard
working students through college. The
principal mover in the plan is the Stud
ents' Aid Society, which expects to be
able to find employment for many, colle
gians when the desired type and presses
are secured. ;' ; â¢-";
It is proposed to employ students in the
new printing office. There are many at
the university who understand type-set
ting, and each year fieshmen enter who
would be glad of the opportunity to work
their way through colle.e by setting type.-
This will be the greatest advantage of the
new scheme, and is _ the reason why the'
Students' Aid Society is so hard at work
to carry it out.

OUT FOR MISSION
IMPROVEMENTS
The Go- Ahead ; Five- Mile
Club Ready for i
Battle.
Some Things â¢ Which They
Feel They. Must â¢ v
'-'-â¢> Have.
A Sanitary Schoolhouse, a Safe Bridge
and Car Tracks Level With the .
Road Demanded.
With .the new year the members of the
Mission Five-mile : Club purpose to enter
upon an energetic campaign for much
needed improvements. .Not that 1 this or
ganization has been dormant in this : re
gard in its previous history, which extends
only over a period of six months, but the
needs have become so urgent and the
membership has become so large that the
club has outgrown some of the methods
which sufficed in its late infancy. . That is
why the meeting which is to be held Mon
day to adopt a constitution and by-laws
is deemed by the members important;
Officers are also to beelected, but tbfs is less ;
important,. as the present corps has served j
faithfully and it is not unlikely they, will
retain their positions. '
The region represented by the. Five
mile Club is. an ex'erfsive one. It is
bounded .by .'-the .Mission - road; .Holly.
Park, University street and the | county
line and embraces the Spring Valley, Col
lege and Exce'sior homesteads.' Dr. E. N.
Torello, President of the club, is authority
for the statement that this' district has
been shamefully neglected heretofore in
spite of the fact that homes have been in
creasing in it with remarkable rapidity. -i
Chief among the demands of the com
munity is a new sobool building. About
the necessity of that there can be no dis
pute. The present building did service on
San Bruno road for a number of years. -.
Then about fourteen years ago it was
moved to its present location on China
avenue, near the Mission road.. As the
attendance increased additions were made
to the building, until now it is truly an
edifice of shreds and patches.- Its archi
tectural defects, however, would probably
be overlooked if it were not for its sani
tary condition. In many. respects it is a
menace to the life of its occupants,* and it
has been severely condemned by Health
â Officer Lovelace. - From the new Board of
Supervisors the district - hopes ' for a new
schoolhouse.
Another crying evil is the unsafe condi
tion of the Channel-street bridge. When
the Mission road was widened some years
-back, this bridge for some reason was' not
made to conform to the road. It is sonar
row now that the cartracks occupy almost
its entire surface. Its retaining walls. are
about twenty years old and each storm
washes the- banks away in an alarming
manner. During the recent storm sand
.washed away the bridge and delayed' the
passage of the cars lor several hours. .On
another occasion a car narrowly escaped
being thrown over tlie embankment by
debris which had washed on the tracks.
Through the efforts of the club the
water company.' was persuaded * recently .
to lay water mains along Mission road.
The residents now see no reason why hy
drants should not' be erected and the j; ex
travagant insurance rates-which; they are
now compelled to pay reduced."- There is
also a disagreement between the street
railway company and the 'municipality.
to the correct- grade of the Mission road,
which the; club members are anxious to
see abolished. Mission road was graded
and macadamized at a cost of about $4 a
front foot.
The grade established at this time the
railroad company declares to be incorrect,
and they.ad ere to the grade of their own
engineer. This is at some places several
inches above the" street urade, and is a
constant menace to . travel. The club
hopes to have the track lowered.
; ' The 'present pound limits are unsatis
factory to the residents of the district.
The present pound limit is the interior
boundary of the district in which the club
is interested. Tbe members desire - : their
district protected by the pound ordinance,
and hence wish the county line made the
district., :_ â  v .>'â â¢' .'.' 'y-^: â¢:^ yyiyyy^yyy.
There are a number of other improve
ments, ' such .as lights, sewers , and . new
streets,, which the club hopes to obtain in
good time. _____________

Cloran met with a very unhappy ex

noises were proclaiming the death of 1896.

along- the railrcad track from Irving tori to
this city. When a few '.'mile's on 'bis
journey he slipped off . the "track and fell
into a culvert. _.-"â¢" 'â ' " ' ' .
Owing to the recent rains there was
quite a torrent of water rushing through
the culvert, and Cloran, dazed and hurt
by .'.'bis v fall, was in danger of being
drowned; fie succeeded in getting to the
side of the creek alter being ; swept
through the culvert, ana- as he did- not
want to freeze to death in -his wet clothes
'he again took the track and continued his
way. ' ' -:,;.â¢ '-. â¢ ' --. â¢ _â

shoulder-blade besides inflicting other in.

of the third AJarquis of Montrose, and

cording to custom, having been a peeress,

came about that. Sir John Bruce lived
with the - Countess of. Montrose with all

The seats on either side -of 300 feet of
table were thrice filled to-day with Oak
land's poor and needy. . If any one in
this city started the new year' with an
empty stomach it was not the fault oi the
Salvation Army, for, although they ; were
enabled to minister generously to the
physical needs of the. unfortunate, they
were prepared, to attend to even, more
than presented themselves. .. :
! The Targe armory, which adjoins "the
meeting ; hall in the 'Washington-street â 
barracks was handsomely decorated, and
from noon to 3-.o' clock the stream of visi
tors never ceased." The tables were boun
tifully supplied- with -all the good fare that
is considered necess.ary to a happy enjoy
nient of New Year's.day. The guests were
waited upon so cheerfully and gayly as to
make it appear that it was an honor io
the .uniformed -brothers ' and sisters to
have them to minister unto.

once an English Countess, Hon. Emma
Sugden, Secretary Land, who is fp.ur

the most prominent figures directing- the
little army of willing workers. Junior
lads and lassies were also present to help
supply the appetites of their guests, and

sunshine made the scene' one of the most
cheerful .that any one could desire. ; '..]y ' r

joyed himself- and perhaps it is not cyni
cal to say that the one who derived most
satisfaction from the banquet was the man
who took upon himself to criticize every

J. Lawson and H. Babcock .Win â¢ the "
â¢ Decorations for the Time â¢ Â
Being.
'-' The hew year opened auspiciously for
the.San Francisco Golf Club. This sturdy .
young organization has been born only
about half a year, but the invigorating
exercise on the links and the good* fellow- .
ship which exists in the- cozy little club
house back of the Presidio Reservation
have proved the magnets which have at- Â«
tracted many to the club. At present the
club .. boasts a membership jof over fifty, â¢
about twenty .or "whom are. ladies. The
1 tter are mostly recent acquisitions to
the membership, and they have become
infatuated with the sport. ..'"Â«' Â
'.* The most important competition which
the club has yet known was held yester- .
day. . Two , beautiful medals to be con- *
tested for periodically were won for 'the '
first time. , The most valuable of these â .
the * Liverpool gold medal to be com- ?
peted for annually in .scratch play. This .
medal is of handsome design and finished /
workmanship. It bears on one side* a .
mythical bird, with the name ''Liverpool
medal" subscribed. On the other side is ay
representation of a golf-player in the act
of making a vigorous stroke', Beneath thi* v
is . the legend, "Far . and sure." This :
medal ' was won yesterday by J. Lawson, -
who bad a handsome lead over his com- *
petitors.' . .;". . . 'â¢ â¢"â¢_â¢ .''.';
The silver medal, also of beautiful de- â¢
sign, is to be competed for monthly. The
contests for this token are to be handicap
events, and hence some very interesting
contests are anticipated. . In yesterday's .
match for tbis medal H. Babcock, with a
handicap of 10, won. "He â  had nothing to
spare in bis victory, however, for C. 'Page,
-with a similar handicap,. came within one â¢
of his score. The playing throughout this
match was close and exciting. .
The day's scores were not nearly so good
as the players might reasonably' expect '
under more. favorable circumstances. The .
links were heavy with the late rain arid â¢
the footing was slow and uncertain. This
fact.kept many out of the play who would
otherwise have been competitor's. There â¢
was quite a, large number of spectators â¢
during the day. The. first match, for the
Liverpool medal, lasted from 10 a. m. to
12:30, and the second match from 1:30 to
3:30. Â; ".'', '.".' .': 'Â .\ â '
The members of the club point wilh
pride to the record they have made in de- '
veloping the youth of the neighborhood
into first-class caddies. The main diffi- .
. culty they 'explain was in keeping the
boys from, entering so * thoroughly
into- the spirit of the occasion as
â¢to .forget -that they . are .paid , re- â¢
tamers and following the example , of
their employers and accost the players as
plain Smith or Brown without the i respect
ful prefix. .'That "has a\l been '.'remedied* '.'
now. The boys lug the cases of golf sticks .
over the links in mute respect and every
thing.is getting along nicely.

matches: " '"]"'â¢ . -.

â¢ The Corrigan entry, Moylan, was a pro
nounced 7 to 10 choice for the third event,
. a six-furlong sprint, decided under selling
conditions. * Much was expected of Ara
pahoe, played from threes to 13 to 5. The
fayorite was cut off at the start, but went
around his field, and in a hard drive
finished ahead before the second choice
Arapahoe. Petrarch showing continually
improving form was but a head farther
away.
The : s9ven- furlong jaunt that was fifth
on the card was pretty easy for Greyhurst,
the 7to 5 favorite. He made most of the
running and downed George Palmer a
head with something in reserve. Willie
j Martin, rode Nonchalance, which was
j heavily backed at 4to 1. Either Martin
did not unduly exert himself pr else the
j horse had. no speed, for he ran in "lob
ster" fashion.
The final race over one mile and a fur
long proved an easy win for Red Glenn,
the odds-on favorite, which won very
easily from * Little Cripple, second choice

He Wanted to Become a Detective, but
Was Easily Persuaded to Resign.
After discussion of an important arrest,
stories that the subject suggested natu
rally followed, and this one, in the De
troit Free Press, was told by a leading
business man who would not care to have
his name accompany it: .
"Like the great majority of boys I was
infatuated with detective yarns, and by
-reading them became possessed with the
idea that. I' had the special qualifications
of a great thief-taker. ' The practical men
: in-tbis line of business did not encourage
my desire to. enter their ranks, but per
sistency is one of my characteristics anil
â¢ I was given a chance as a volunteer- with
out pay. '
"Just at the time I began operations
' there was a number of. footpads operating
in the -city, and I secretly determined to
win' my spurs at once by rounding up
these knights of the pavement. I", con
ceived the brilliant idea cf inakin'g myself
upas, a decoy, putting on a fine suit of
clothes, Plug hat, plated chain and paste'
studs. Then I betook myself to the more
retired portions Qf tbe city and wandered
about in search of game. .'.
"Asa decoy I was a howling success. I
had just passed a dark alley when 1 was
swiped to the earth with a sandbag; a re
volver-muzzle was inserted into my right
; ear and I had a very misty comprehension
! of what was going on^while being stripped
;of my cheap adornments, arms and
! pocket-book.
"I rested from the effects of the assault
! for about ten minutes, but was very shaky
lon my pins. This must have created the
1 impression that I was a swell on a toot,
| for I was held up three times in as many
i blocks and soundly thrashed each time
| for not having something to reward the
i ruffians for their.trouble.
"You can be sure the case was never re
| ported and all 1 have ever said to the de
! partment was that they would have to get
i along without me because Ii had stumbled
I upon a much better thing.-. I still think I
[had a great scheme if the footpads had
only stood in with it."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 2, 1897,
BECKER IS A
SPEEDY RIDER
Was Invincible Against a
Dozen Crack Profes
sional Cyclers.
He Won the . Great ~ Five-Mile
Event at the Velodrome
in Record Time.
Rnss : Maintains His . Position as the
Champion Amateurâ Mott 's Fast ;
Exhib.tion;Rd-V:
The pleasant weather and attractive
programme drew an immense crowd to
the Velodrome cycling park yesterday
afternoon. Tbe same exciting finishes
characterized the riding: as was seen at
the meet on Christmas day, and the win
ners were heartily applauded by the spec
tators.. ,
The Velodrome people furnish one, de
lightful adjunct to their meets, and that
is a very excellent band of music, which
discourses a long and varied programme
of popular airs, tending to make the after
noons all the more enjoyable.
The meet was handled by the following
officials:
Referee, Henry F. Wynne; judgesâ H. H.
White, E. B. Jerome, F. H. Kerrigan; timersâ
J. S. Cornwell, George H. Stratton, A. P.
Swain, E. E. Stoddard; scorersâ W. I. Pixley,
George Brouillet, H. D. Haydenfeldt; um
piresâ T. H. Meherin, J. S. Egan, C. E.
Griffiths, R. S. Duncan; clerk of course. A. W.
Wehe; assistantsâ Charles D. Petre, T. G.
Spillane; starter, Douglas While; announcer,
W. F. Knapp; assistant announcer, John C.
Mines; . marshal, C. W. Myrick; handicapper,
R.A. Smythe; L. A. W. representative, R. M.
Welch.
The star event of the programme was
the five-mile scratch professional race, run
in three mile heats, the winners and two
fastest seconds in each to qualify for the
final.
Those who came out for the first heat
were Harry F. Teirill and Horace Slater,
Bay City WheelmeD, Max Morris of Texas,
and Allan Jones, Olympic. -Arthur Boy
den was put in to pace and made it very
fast. The finish was a beauty. Terrill
jumped to the lead on the last lap, with
Jones alonside. They rode this way for
half a lap, and Terrill by a little extra
shove barely won in 2:17 2-5.
In the second heat were C. S. Wells, Bay
City, Georee Bovee of Texas, W. E. Becker
of Minneapolis and F.M. Byrne, Impe
rial. . Roma Dow was the pacemaker.
Wells caught first place behind the pacer
at the start, but Becker gained the cov
eted position by a clever play. On the
bell tap they all sprinted, Becker winning
handily from Bovee, Wells third. The lime
was 2:15 3-5.
The starters in the third heat were W.
A. Terrill, Bay City; D. E. Whitman of
Los Angeles, and C. E. Dow of Seattle.
Ed Chapman of Napa set the pace and
Whitman was the first to catch him.
The finish was wildly exciting. Terrill,
who was last when the bell rang, and had
to ride way up on the bank, clearly
showed his superiority over his competi
tors by winning after a hard struggle,
Whitman being a close second. The time
was 2:16 3-5. This brought into the final
the Terrill brothers, Bovee, Whitman and
Becker. "Dow and 'Boy den were put in to
pace the first two miles.
After a pretty fight for the tandem,
Becker got it, the order being Becker,
Bovee, Whitman, "Bob" Terrill and
Harry Terrill. The first mile was' made
in Ihe startling ; time of 2:07 3-5, record
time for the Velodrome.
..In the second mile there was'another
fight for the tandem between Harry Ter
rill. Whitman and Becker. The" latter got
it, Terrill second. The two miles were
made in 4:20. "Bob" Terrill dropped out
at this point.
On the third mile tbo positions were
Becker, Harry Terrill, Bovee, Whit
man. The second tandem, Chapman and
McCrea, here druppei in, making a poor
mck-up. The pace was Killing and Terrill
dropped back. Whitman and Bovee also
lost the tandem, and Becker was alone be
hind it. The time for three miles was 6:32
for Becker. The others were/half a lap
behind..
The tandem kept making the pace faster
and faster for Becker, and still he hung
on. They gained a, lap on Bovee, Whit
man and Terrill, who kept doggedly at it
for second and ; third money. The four
miles were ridden in 8:41 4-5.
Terrill, Bovee and Whitman, a lap be
hind, caught on to the tandem at it
passed and hung there to the finish.
Becker jumped to the front and passed
the tandem on the last lap, ending a most
remarkable race in the , speedy time of
11:20. .Terrill, Bovee and Whitman had
to ride another lap to complete their five
miles, and Terrill was judged the winner.
Whitman third, Bovee fourth.
This Was one of the greatest races ever
seen : on a California- track, and the con
testants and particularly the . winner,
BecKer, were cheered â¢ to the echo by the
highly excited audience.
The gallery crowd was dissatisfied with
the decision of the judges giving, second
place to Terrill, and kept yelling "Bovee."
The latter entered a protest with the
racing board, which was; allowed, giving
him second place and putting Terrill back
to third. . The audience was greatly
pleased with this decision. .'_
Becker, the winner, is the five-mile Na
tional champion, an honor which he won
at the big League of American Wheel
men's meet at Louisville last August,
against all the crack riders of the United
States. He easily sustained bis : reputa
tion: by his great per foiia ance of yester
day.*;' - '.--'--;- : "*'.'
The day's sport commenced with one of
a series of three match races between two
amateurs from Marin 1 County â H. E.
Grimmenstein of Sausalito and H. W.
Collins of San Kafael. :/, The distance of
the first race was one mile, and the race
was , paced ;by IE. J. Smith . of the i Acme
Club. ..It was an easy victory for Collins,
who made the distance in 2:29 2-5.
The second race, two miles, was won
by Grimmenstein in 4:53 4-5. The pacing
was done by Smith "and V Joseph Catanich.
'. The -third race was > also _at â  two miles,
paced by the same men; and was won by
Collins, Grimmenstein '"â â  having fallen '..: on
the .west bank. The time was 5:01. Col
lins was then declared amateur champion
of Marin County.
-The one amateur race on the programme
was a mile-post race, run in four heats to
reduce the field, with X prizes for the win
ner of ; each lap in '.the final. Those who
qualified were -E. F. . Buss, Olympic M.
M. Cook, Los Angeles; P. R. Mott, Reli
ance; C. D. Gooch, Reliance; George Wy
man, Acme, and Tony Alborelle, Olym
pic. 'r-'': ' .''[ '''^^mBM
Russ took the first lap after a hard fight
with Mott; Gooch' won" the second from
Wyman, and Mott 'â â  got the third, closely
pressed by Cook. . Cook tried to get the
fourth, but Wyman beat . him by inches.
Alborelle * won - the * fifth; r and then Russ
jumped to the front and won handily in
2:17, Alborelle : second, Wym an ' third. It
was a interesting and closely con
tested race and the management should
introduce similar ones often.
George E. Dixon and Charles A. Kraft
of the Boy City .Wheelmen rode a mile
tandem exhibition in 2:012-5. The half
was made in 56 seconds. /
- Percy Mott of tbe Reliance Club rode a
half-mile exhibition, paced by Gooch and
Elf ord on i a tandem, in 54 2-5 seconds,
breaking- the coast record. The world's
record is 53 seconds. ;_.â *>â¢â 
A mile race on tbe old-style high wheels
between E. Thompson, A. Harder and C.

THE COW PUNCHER'S STORY.
And the Contemptuous Comments It
Elicited From the Poet.
"When we were talking about- scars the
other day," _ said the returned Cow
Puncher, "did. l tell you about this one on
my hnzer?"
"Forgot that, I guess," said the Boy's
Own Story Writer.
"Hadn't made it up yet, you mean,"
sneered the Poet. "It ought to be a good
one. He's had a week to work it up in."
The poet, it may be well to explain, had
been indulging in late suppers of "lob"
and beer, a diet which is guaranteed to
produce a state of mind favorable to
poetry.- 6___F___>l
- Almost anything is favorable to poetry
provided it is indigestible enough, and
"lob" (which is to say lobster) and beer
answer these requirements so well that
the Poet almost -invariably counts on
them for a sonnet, whereas a Welsh rab
bit produces only a quatrain or a rondeau.
However, patrons. tuou__h they may be
of modern poetry, . "lob" and beer are
pretty hard on lriendship. Things have
been said against the society of poets and
of -pessimist- I , ' taken singly. when it
comes to taking both in the same dose it
might truly be called allopathic. ' All of
which is necessary to explain the Poet's
state of mind. The Cow Puncher was
serenely indifferent.
"No," he said reflectively, "lt isn't much
of a story. . If I realiy put my mind to it
I think I could make up a better one; but
truth is something after all. It happened
this way. I was sitting in our cabin writ
ing a letterâ"
"A love letter?" from the Poet. â¢
"Bight you are!" .said the unabashed
Cow Puncher. "And it was a better one
than you ever wrote, too! If I could
make a collection of the love letters which
Uncle Sam brings away from those des
erts and mountains out there I'd give you
poets and novelists material that would
last you one while, and that's straight!
You don't know what .love is, with yonr
namby-pamby leelings based on your cal
culations as to how much it cost for two
people to live in New York!" v
The Cow Puncher, showed every symp
tom of being excited, but be disappointed
the Poet. The Poet rately has great emo
tion himself,* but he makes a good deal of
copy out of the emotions into which other
people are betrayed in his. presence. The
Cow Puncher suddenly, cooled off, how
ever, after a fashion of his own.
"Texas is a great State," he remarked-,
and lighted a ciirarette.
"How about that scar?" said the Boys'
Own.
' "Well, I. was going to tell you. As I
said, I was sitting there writing a letterâ a
love letter when 1 felt something sorter
tickle my left hand, which was resting on
the table. 1 kind of moved it a little, in
voluntarily. 1 didn't thinK anything
about it. Supposed it was a fly. But in a
few minutes my linger began to paiu me,
arid when I looked in that direction there,
it you please, was a vinigaroon silting
there and fattening on my blood. What's
a vinigaroon? Well, .he Mexicans call
'em 'sure death,' and in about five min
utes I was ready to believe they deserved
the name. My hand swelled 'and turned
black. In a few. hours my whole arm was
swollen and as black as my coatâ or my
prospects. ;
"1 didn't know what to do for the
blamed thing and I was miles from every
where ; and everything except v the ">. vine
garoon, which 1 had promptly killed on'
principle. "1 smoked and walked the floor
and tried to think. of things I had read
about what to do, in emerjiencie?, but tbe
only course of - treatment 1 I could remem
ber w'3s *to r roll : the patient on a , barrel.
That didn't seem to fit my case, and, be
sides," who would do the roiling, anyway.;
The fellows had all gone off to the ranch,
where we occasionally put in our Sundays,
and my only hope was that some of them
would come home during the day instead
of waiting until night. ',;.'.
."About the midule of ; the afternoon an
old plainsman came < loping along, and I
didn't waste time or words in telling him
about my difficulty., .Those old 'â ! fellows
never took any course in first aid to the
injured, but* tney could give la. whole lot
oi lectures on 'What to -Do When You've
Got ; Any-Old Thing i the;; Matter With
You.' r He looked at my hand, and then
he said: . - â ^"B^j^BjESÃ^P^jy^HHl^^^BSÃ
"â  " 'On, yes ! we'll fix that all right
"He whipped out bin knite and whistled
happily to himself the while. ", First he
made a lengthwise cut where the bite was
and then he made a crosswise cut in the
same spot. Then he pulled the skin well
back so as jto leave a good opening, and,
taking his powder horn he poured a good
charge of "gunpowders in to, the i cut. He
kept , right on whistling, too, as he
scratched a match and a waited for it to get
into a good blaze. Then he made me hold
my hand out a good distance, touched off
i heW gunpowder and; there Ii was.-?; He
cleaneJ it out and dressed it, and although
1 had to hold my, hand up in a sling above
my j head for several days, I'm none the
worse for the experience, except ".for that
scar." 'â :-''"-: 'â -.;:"- . ; -. â 
The Boys' Own couched with â  some em
barrassment as the Cow Puncher finished.
."-'â  "That's very, interesting, "h9 said. .. ,
"Couldn't you do better tlian that?"

The Kaiser's Valets.
The Emperor William has twelve va
lets, whose sole duty is to take care of his
uniforms and costumes, the value of
which is estimated at $500,000. The Lon
don .Globe " correspondent says that his
uniforms of the German army and navy,
including helmets, cans,- shakos, rifles,
swords and sabers, are kept in cupboards.
Next to these come the Uniforms of the
Saxons, Bavarians, Hessians and others.
Separated in other large cupboards are
the Austrian, Russian, Swedish, English
and Italian uniforms, all ready to accom
pany the Kaiser in his ; journeys, or to be
used on the occasion*, of princely visits.
Finally must be mentioned bis hunting
and shooting costumes, his court dresses,
his yachting and lawn 'tennis uniforms
and his private dresses. When the Em
peror travels: his uniforms and costumes
fill two or three carriages. His Majesty is
very, fond*- of jewelry and curios. 1. He
wears half a dozen rings, a large watch
and, chain and a bracelet on his right arm.

Senator S. C. Smith, representing Kern
and San Luis Obispo, was at the Grand
yesterday. He has the honor of repre
senting a city which did not exist two
years ago. Randsburg. the metropolis of
a famous ' mining region, is in Kern
County, only a mile and a half from the
county line, Mr. Smith is clever as a
writer and a speaker and. is sure to be on
the alert to guard the interests of Rands
burg. "yr rt :
â¢ Assemblyman Hudson of Monterey and
Senator Trout of Santa Cruz were in San
Francisco yesterday. The latter will at
tend the caucus of Republican Senators
to-morrow at Sacramento.
Senator Mahoney of. this City will leave
for the capital this afternoon.
Senator Bulla, who will exert as much
influence in the Senate this winter as he
did in the Assembly two years ago, will co
directly from his home to Sacramento.
Sickness in his family may cause his ab
sence during the organization of the
Senate.
Senator E. C. Voorheis was expected in
San Francisco yesterday, but may no from
Sutler Creek to the capital without com
ing to this City.
Senator C. M. Simpson of Pasadena and
Senator Thomas Flint of San Benito were
at the Union League Club yesterday. The
indications are that Lieutenant-Governor
Jeter will be received by the Senators
with the courtesy due bis station, and
with the kindness with which one gentle
man may greet another, but he will not
be 'invited to compose the Senate standing
committees or participate in the distribu
tion of patronage.
The general talk among the Senators in
town yesterday leads to the impression
that the organization of the Legislature
will not be effected next Monday. No
desire for haste is manifested, although if
both houses should organize on Monday
the tirst ballot for United States Senator
would take place Tuesday, January 12.
Sbould the organization be not effected
until Tuesday or Wednesday the first
ballot for Senator will take place Tuesday,
January 19. / '.
Frank L Coombs, it is thought, will
encounter no opposition in his candidacy
as Speaker of the Assembly. Brewster C.
Kenyon of Los Angeles is talked of promi
nently for Speaker pro tern.
The San Francisco delegation of Re
publicans will leave for Sacramento at 7
o'clock his morning. . A . caucus will be
held at the Capitol this afternoon. -
The Senate is composed of twenty-eight
Republicans and twelve Democrats. The
Assembly is composed* of * forty-six* Re
publicans and thirty-four Democrats and
Populists. Assemblyman Lundsborough,
a Democrat of Sacramento, has been
indicted by a Grand Jury 'of bis con
stituents, and may not be able to take his
seat. Should he resign, the Governor
could call an election to fill the vacancy.
It is an open question whether a
majority of Republicans will decide to go
into caucus on the Senatorship. < 'â " â 
The number of members tied up .by
pledges is not large, so the right to exer
cise individual judgment and consult with
constituents will not be denied. -.Many Re
publicans observe that there is a disposi
tion upon the part of one Democratic pa
per to whip everybody into line for Per
kins, and so a counter current has teen
awakened. The talk was common enough
last night among well-informed men that
no Senatorial aspirant had a walkover.
The average workday in Germany lasts

SHOT "IN; THE HAND.
Billy O'Donnell Wounded by __ Bullet
From William Godfrey's Gun. -â -C-vX
William Godfrey, assistant secretary of
the ';. Calif ia; Jockey * Club, ; shot Billy,
O'Donnell in the hand in the Cafe Colum
bia, 15 Powell street,- last evening.
Whether the shooting was intentional
or accidental is not known. , â  Charles
Green, proprietor of the Columbia, is !of
the opinion that the shooting was * acci
dental. He . says that ; no .;â¢ argument . or
quarrel .preceded the shootinc, and claims
that the principals are the best of friends.
â :'.-- Early in.; the evening the man who was
shot walked into the; Receiving Hospital
and asked to have his wound dressed. An
examination showed v that a pistol bullet
had passed through the fleshy part of the
right hand. :" The wound was not serious. 1
The.man gave the nameot Frank Jones,
and said that the injury was tlie result of
an accident; The story he > told I was that
he and- a .' ; friend .- were ... examining
their ; revolvers in -.'a saloon on
Market street, vand'-. .that while
passing bis weapon over to his friend the
firearm was accidentally discharged.
More than this he would" not state and
went away; as soon as the injury was
dressed. : " , '' * ; â â â -Ââ 
THREE CUTTING SCRAPES.
G. I) Harrington j J.'.' J. Cahalan and C.
M. Lamm Suffering rom Ugly V
Knife "Wounds.
The new year was ushered in in the
lower strata ot society by several cutting
affairs, which, while not of a very serious
nature, will compel, the victims to go
bandaged for several days. At an early
hour in the morning a row was started in
a saloon on Fourth and _ /streets in
which George D. Harrington of 169 Minna
took a prominent part. The saloon-keeper
named Cullen also entered the fray, and
he cut Harrington on both hands and the
forehead with a knife. Harrington was
sent to the Receiving Hospital for repairs.
C. M. Lamm, a seafaring man, was also
I treated at the hospital for several wounds
[on his hands and ear. ' According to his
story he is a sailor on the ship Win held
Scott, and during the early part of the
night he had a good-time after the man
ner of his kind drinking in a saloon on
Pacific street. When be was leaving the
place he was assaulted by r a man who
looked like a Mexican and stabbed as de
scribed. Lamm says that assault was
unprovoked.
The case of J. J. Cahalan of 5 Morris
avenue was somewhat "- peculiar and
showed the remarkable effect of Fifth
street liquor. Cahalan had been drinking
heavily, and in his rounds wound up in a
saloon on Clara street, where he smarted a
fight. "-..-.'*."
;-"; From all accounts he got the worst of the
row, and the man with whom he had the
difficulty snipped out as soon as he saw
Cahalan take his ; jack Knife I. from his
pocket.; Although his adversary had fled,
Cahalan was determined to draw blood, so
he slashed the blade across his own throat,
producing an ugly but not a dangerous
wound. He was . sent .to -the . Receiving
Hospital, where he caused much trouble
to the surgeons who dressed" the wound.. '
Late in the afternoon Charles Swanson,
a sailor, who was under the influence of
liquor, walked into the hospital with his
right ear hanging down over, his coat-col-
Jarâ another * case * v here ;. tbe ' New Year's
knife had been at work. Swanson said
that he Jives at 143 East street, and that
while in.'a," fight with another sailor the
latter had used a carving-knife ;- on his
(Swanson's) head. It required several
stitches to get the sailor's ear back to any
thing like its natural position. ' â '-'â¢â **, f
